14025	The outer membrane of the cell controls how much goes in and out of the cell.  Through the process of osmosis, water moves in or out of a cell depending on if there is a higher or lower concentration within the cell.  Another way they control this is by the growing of the outer membrane.  If there is too much of a substance within the cell, it will break apart to allow enough room.

14139	Cells use passive transport through methods of diffusiion and osmosis, and also have the abilirty to use active transport with functions such as exo/endocytosis and sodium potassium pumps.
14140	Selective permiablity, which lets only certain things pass, like a window screenendocytosis, brings in certain substances by opening the plasma membrane and absorbing themexocytosis, uses the same process as endocytosis except its removing substances from the cell
14141	There are many processes that control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, but three of the processes are, the movement through the cell's selectively permeable membrane, the movement of waste products by the lysosmes, and the excretion of protiens for the use of the rest of the body.
14142	The cell membrane is used to protect the cell. The cell wall is used to block any harmful things out.
14143	One process cells use to control the movement of substances across the area is osmosis.  Osmosis is when a substance passes through water to move from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient.  A second process used to help control the movement is diffusion.  Diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient.  A third process to help control movement is facilitated diffusion where particles are used to help the movement from the high to low concentration gradients.

14176	prophase, anaphase and telophase
14177	The cell uses the flagellum to move easier the move easier throught the cell. The cell also uses it cell wall in order to keep the substances in the cell. The third process the cell uses is its nucleus to control the cell.
14178	1. Active transport is a process that requires energy because it moves substances against their concentration gradient.2. Simple diffusion is a type of passive transport that moves substances down their concentration gradient. This process requires no energy.3. Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses protein to move substances across the cell membrane. No energy is required for this process.
14179	1. Mitochondrion2. Cytoplasm3. Nucleus
14180	One process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis. Osmosis is the controlled amount of water that goes through the membrane of the cell. Another process is diffusion. Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane. This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane. Only some substances can leave and only some may enter. The third process is the permeability of the cell. The cell is semi-permeable so it will only let in some of the substances that try to enter the cell.
14181	The  processes that the cel uses to control the movemetn of substances across the cell membrane is by having the rule of high concentration to low concentration, and also low concentration to high concentration. If a substance is trying to move across the cell membrane then that substance will have to be able to move for low to high, or high to low concentrations.
14182	difusion. facillitated difusion. osmosis.
14183	Cells have protein channels that direct the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Osmosis is the process in which outside substances can penetrate through cell membrane. Diffusion is the process of substances moving on a gradient from high to low.
14184	ingulf or eating food, absorbtion asorbing, waste removal
14185	There are a few processes used by cells to control the movement of the substances across the cell. Three examples include homeostasis, diffusion, and meiosis.
14186	The cells membrane only allows certain objects to enter the cell.They also use the nuclei to help kind of filter what goes across and into the cell. The other things they use is a cell wall, of course only in plant cells.
14187	Cells use many things to move things. Defusion is one way, another would osmoses, and i do not know a third. so yes.
14188	Useing organelles.
14189	1. They are connected to the membrane so that they can controll movement.2. they are feeding the membrane, giving it nutrients and such to make it work better.3.there is a thick gell that allows only the movement of substances pass through.
14190	One process used by cells is energy that functions the cell membrane.The second process used by cells is the cell wall keeping the cell membrane protected.The third process used by cells is the nucleus control everything to keep the movement on track.
14191	They use the cell membrane to transport certain types of things into and outside the cell. They can use the cytoplasm inside to halp also move things. They use proteins to transport thing around the cell.
14192	1. Osmosis, the equilzation of water in and outside the cell.2. Organelles, which prevent unessesary functions.3. The Nucleus, the 'brain' of the cell.
14193	The cells carry subtances along the membrane to other places in the body. They also use their platelets to stop things.
14194	iht obtains sugar nd vacculs
14195	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mRNA, enzymes, and lipids. All three of the processes help control movement. MRNA also helps transfer DNA across the membrane to amino acids in protein.
14196	Selective permabilitymitosis
14197	anaphase prophase interphase
14198	Active transport- using energy to move something across the membrane.Inactive transport- No energy needed to move a substance across the membrane.Facillitated diffusion- inactive transport that uses proteins to move a substance across the membrane.
14199	Diffusion is when a liquid is transferred across a membrane.Phagocytosis is when an object is enveloped by the membrane.
14200	Golgi Bodies for packaging waste products. Lysosomes used to eat away at the wastes. ER used to move ribosomes.
14201	Blood clots that way the blood wont get out of control.
14202	1. they block other organisms from entering the cell membrane2. they help build a wall to keep things out3. they kill off bad organisms
14203	1)protein channells only allow certain things through.     2)the cell membrane only aloows in small things.     3)active transport
14204	1. the cells only let certain cells in 2. they use little holes in the outer layer to let substances in.3. they fight off any bacteria or anything they dont want on the cells membrane

14206	Photosynethsis helps a plant survive.Cell splilting to make two cells.Breathing.
14207	The cell membrane moves substances near the nucleaus. As new cells form, the membrane starts to multiply as the cells do.
14208	One prcess is the use of the semi-permeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell. Another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell. in plants their cell wall controls what can get into the cell membrane by acting as a barrier from outside organisms.

14213	They transfer the DNA. They store proteins. And collect enzymes. They do all of that so that the cell can function.
14214	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are flagenal, bristles, and rebosomes.
14215	The proteins control what gets in and out of the cell membrane.If something is too big to get through the membrane it can stretch to make room. Polar heads face out inside and outside of the cell membrane because there is water on both sides. Non-polar tails are smooshed in between the polar heads so they don't touch water.
14216	three processes used by the calls to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are cellular resparation, photosynthesis, and cell division.
14217	one process used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrans is the cell wall. another processes but wich cells use to control the substances that cross the cell membranes are the phospholipids that line that cell wall these help keep unwanted thing out as well. lastly one last process used by cells to control the movment of substances across the cell membrans are membranes thar act as little doors that open and close to let thing inside.
14218	Active TransportFacilated Diffusion   Simple Diffusion
14219	Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell. Neither of these require energy for the cell to use. Active transport, on the other hand, is a process of movement which does require energy.
14220	The purpose of the membrane is to help pass over the stuff your  body takes in or needs. It separates the good stuff and the bad.

14224	1. Cells can use Passive Transports, which is where there is no energy used.2. Cells can use Active Transports, which is where there is energy used.
14225	1. The cell cycle
14226	They have flagella to help them move the substances across the cell membrane. The cell membrane also chooses if the bacteria or substance can enter. Then the cell uses active transport.
14227	The cells send a message to the brain when something is going wrong like if you touch a hot stove the cells send a message saying hey this is hot and your hand then knows to move away.
14228	Diffusion - The cell allows materials to pass through the membrane.Osmosis - The cell allows water to pass through the membrane.
14229	transfusion
14230	1 they are small
14231	the cell membrane controls them by having openings only certain substances can go in, by making a substance that wont allow them to come in and by letting some in
14232	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are, active, transive transport.
14233	the cells absorb it and carry it to where it has to go. the cell pushes it. the cell flows with it to make it go where it has to go
14234	One is a selectively permeal membrane, which only allows what is neccessary to move across the cell membrane. Another is homeostasis, which keeps everything stabilized. And a last one is osmosis, which allows things to move about the cell membrane.
14235	They've got the cell wall so not everything can come in or out.
14236	Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration. Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.
14237	Osmosis moves water through the cell membrane.
14238	Controlling movement
14239	The three processes used are TRNA, DNA, and flagellum to control the movement of substances through the cell membrane.
14240	Cells use
14241	Organelles.
14242	1. the cells allows what goes into the membrane.2. the cells allow what goes out of the membrane.3. it controls how the membrane allows the cell to reproduce.
14243	Well they can move they reproduce and they have some crazy thing called a cell wall.
14244	Osmosis, is the passing of things across a membrane. Meiosis, and Mitosis.
14245	the membrane will split som that certain substances can pass through.
14246	cells use the flagella..
14247	cell wall- it prevents things from coming in and going out.
14248	Ribosomes, Mitochondria, and the nucleus
14249	They have the same cells so they can move from place to place.
14250	One process is active transport which cells do to get proteins.another process is when cells multiple.The last proces is when the cells reproduce.
14251	The cytoplasm moves the ribosome around in the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum moves the ribosomes into the nucleus. The golgi apparatus removes the unwanted substances out of the cell.

14256	Translation, obsorbs food. Endocytosis, when food enters. Exocylosis, when waste exits.
14257	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the sodium potassium pump, endocytosis, and exocytosis.      The sodium potssium pump pumps sodium ions out and potassium ions in. It is a form of active transport,     Endocytosis moves large materials into the cell by the use of a vesicle; it is a form of active transport.     And exocytosis moves large materials out of a cell by the use of a vesicle; it is also a form of active transport.
14258	The nucleus holds all the DNA and controls the cells functions. The proteins help control what passes through the cell membrane. The cell membrane also determines what comes in and out of the cell.
14259	The three procedures that a cell uses to move things across the cell membrane are, one it finds out where its going too, two it transports it using flagellum, and three it gets to its destination.
14260	water,oxygen,protein
14261	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.
14262	Active transport- diffusion against the concentration gradient.Passive transport- diffusion along the concentration gradient.Diffusion- The random movement of praticles from an area of high concentraion to low concentration.
14263	1. Absorbing nutrients    Cells must absorb nutrients in order to live. 2. Producing offspring    They must also reproduce to not become extinct.3. Adapting to natural habitats    Cells must be able to be comfortable where they lie in order to survive. They must be familiar with it and know how to live in it.
14264	Osmosis, water is moved through the cell.
14265	Facilitaded diffusion
14266	flagella, cellium,
14267	One is the protein channel and it helps control how much of that substance goes through. Two is the cell membrane which tells the substace where to go and how much of it to go. Three is the mitochondria it also tells how much subtance goes where and how much of it.
14268	1) The movemnets of substances acrosss the cell membrane flow through the blood streams.2)3)
14269	metaphase- slows it down to create the processtelaphase-speeds it up to create the process.
14270	Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell. Active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave. Passive transport is when theres more of something in the cell than there is outside of it, and so some leave the cell to create equilibrium, or vice versa.
14271	Diffusion- to move substances across a cell membraneOsmosis- The diffusion of water into and out of a cellActive Transport- Transporting substances through a cell
14272	Osmosis is when water passes through a barrier, which is selectively permeable in the case of a cell. Diffusion is when the cell tries to reach equilibrium by choosing what enters the cell. Homeostasis is when an organism is in equilibrium with the environment.
14273	Osmosis
14274	1. anaphase2. telophase3. interphase4. prophase
14275	The cell uses three basic processes for movement across the membrane; one is the flagelum, another the cytoplasm and finally the protein in the ribonucleis acid
14276	1. There is the cell wall that only lets wanted materials pass.2. Then there is the cytoplasm that will capturesomething unwanted and get rid of it.3. Lastly there is the nuclear envelope that also only lets wanted materials get through so it helps protect the cell from harmfull things.
14277	IT WILL HAVE TO GO INTO PHASES REPRODUCE

14279	1. Osmosis-water through the cell membrane2. Diffusion-molecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration.3. molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
14280	Substances that are passing out and going in through the menmbrane are wastes that have to go through phosphate groups. Osmosis, which if water moving to an area of high concentration to and area of low concentration, either makes the cell shrink or swell with water. It could result in dehydration or overhydration. Thing thats are too big to pass through the cells pores are not allowed intrance nor exit. Wastes and food particles move in and out through the cell's membrane.
14281	Mitosis, Meiosis,
14282	Three of the processes that cells use to control movement into and out of the cell membrane are protein channels that let substances pass through them, Endosymbiosis allows large substances to enter, and Exocytosis allow larger substances to exit the cell.
14283	Osmosis is one kind of movement. Osmosis is the movement of particle across a cel membrane.Diffusion is another kind of movement across a cell membrane. it moves particles across it by breaking teh particle down.Active transport is another way. Active transport uses energy to get the particles across it safely with out harming the cell.
14284	diffusion
14285	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. Diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles. Active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient, or from low to high concentration.
14286	YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOUR BODY TO DO THINGS AND YOUR BODY DOES THEM. SAME IN ANIMALS,HUMANS AND PLANTS
14287	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances acrosss the cell membrane are
14288	Some cells have a cell wall. A cell wall controls what enters and exits a cell. The cell membrane is very thick and can be very sensitive in what it receives into it.Cell membranes only have openings, like doors, to recieve certain sized things so anything unwanted can be left out.
14289	tRNA, mRNA,rRNA
14290	1) The cell  outer wall membrane: Attaches with the rest of the structures and  functionsof the outer most cell.2) The cell's nucleus: Is the major working system that tells the other parts what to do, a correspondent.3) The cell cytoplasm: moves waste and gathers nutrients from the entire cell to supply it with life.
14291	Osmosis is used to move water across the cell membrane.______ moves large particles across the cell membrane.______ moves small particles across the cell membrane.
14292	The golgi apparatus brings in and take things that are needed.The mitocondria processes and store things until they are used.
14293	injection
14294	Cells move across the membrane with the use of osmosis, diffusion, and homostasis. Osmosis is when the cell determines what is, and is not, allowed to cross the cell membrane. Homostasis is when the cell is both equally stable on the inside and outside of the cell. Diffusion is when molecules are entering and leaving the cell.
14295	Three processes that are udes by the cell to move substances across the cell membrane are the cell wall,
14296	Passive transport, which lets substances across the cell all the time.  Active transport, lets substances move across the cell as well, but active transport isn't used all the time.  Diffusion, which is the movement of higher concentrations to lower concentrations.
14297	They use mRNA to carry messages to the mitochondria and the cell somehow use that message or energy.

14304	The Cell membrane controls what comes in and out of the cell.The Cell Wall creates a outside barrier around the cell, to protect it.
14305	Cells divide, carry oxygen to the brain, deliver nutrents
14306	Osmosis- The process in which water passes through a cell membrane.Diffusion- The process in which substances other than water pass through a cell membrane.Active Transport- The process in which a cell uses ATP as a source of energy to push substances through the cell membrane.
14307	These include passive/active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Passive transport does not require energy, but active transport does. Passive transport is high to low concentration, and active transport is low to high concentration. Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
14308	THIS IS MOVIENT CONTROL AND BY CALL ACROSS.
14309	The nucleus help with gathering substances. Also the ribsomes help keep them moving. The chromotids help keep track of where everything is.
14310	Osmosis, RNA, and Cell reproduction
14311	1. Cell membranes that allow enzymes to move across the cell. 2. The nucleaus that controls all the chemical processes in the cell to maintain homeostasis.3. The cell wall that allows only certain enzymes to enter and exit the cell.
14312	cellular respiration- The respiration of cells.cell division- the dividing of cells.cell frequencies- frequency of cells.
14313	Active transport:Were enrgy is used to let something go out of the body because it is opposite of the flow.Passive transport:Energy is not used to have protiens or other materials pass through the membrane.Osmosis:Were substances pass through the cell membrane because the cell has lower concentration then out side of the cell.
14314	Osmosis, Flagellum, Diffusion
14315	transportation
14316	One way they try carry the substances across the cell membrance is that the cells will go through a special kind of door that only allows a certain kind of substance in.Another way is that the special exits that let out a certain kind of substance.And finally, the third one, the way that they are moved into the cell through a door that allows both subtances into the cell.
14317	Osmosis is the movement of water coming in or leaving the cell through the membrane. Diffusion is where the cell evens out the matter on the inside and outside of the cell.

14322	Three processes used by the cell to control the movement of rsubstance acrosss the cell membrane is the cell wall, the plasma membrane, and the ezyme.
14323	Osmosis is the movement with water.Diffusion transports materials through the memebrane.Facilitated diffusion
14324	The first process is flagella is a tail like structure used for movement.The second process is called cilia it is little hairs that help move cells.The third process is called transfer RNA. It moves around the cell getting information where it needs to go.
14325	the cell membrane is controlled
14326	the cells us enzymes, amino acids, and chromosomes.

14332	FELGELUM
14333	The cell membrane controls the traffic from one side to another side of the membrane.
14334	One way is the tRNA moves proteins to the cytoplasm.Another way is through Active Transport, Active Transport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy.
14335	Passive transportationActive transportationDiffusion
14336	Cells are located in the cell membrane.
14337	the flagellim is used to cause the organism to move about .
14338	The cell uses it little fingers to move things across the surface.
14339	Mutation, transcription, and translation are three processes.
14340	the substancs is put in to the golgi and packaged then put through protine and passed through the cell wall
14341	the cells in the plasma are controlled by the current within the cell. then the nucleus opens and lets cell through.
14342	Transfer
14343	Cells travel through the human body when they are needed. It only takes a matter of seconds for them to get to where they are needed. Example: if you got a scratch on ur knee the second its ripped open and there are diseases and bacteria trying to infect it. There are anti bodies and white blood cells are fighting it off.
14344	flagellum
14345	THE CYTOPLASM MOVES SUBSTANCES AROUND THE CELL. THE CELL ALSO USES PROTEIN SYNTHESIS TO MOVE PROTEINS AROUND THE CELL.
14346	they move from one place to another they all go to the human body they go threw the blood vessal
14347	They take in enery from foods,they use their own ways to move around, and they have a shakey way of getting around things.
14348	Active transport because with active transport the substances are active, and moving around, and not just staying in one place.Deletion because it deletes some of the substances if they get in the way of something, that way they can keep moving.Diffusion because substances are kept moving, and don't just stay still.
14349	1.) they can go through 'doors' called channel protein2.) they can insert their 'key' proetin to unlock the cell membrane in order to pass through3.) they can be transported out of the cell by the organelles

14356	1.anaphase so anaphase means the chromosomes line up in the middle of the membrane2.metaphase they then detach from each other3.telephase they come back and reattach to each other
14357	Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.By Mitosis, the cell is divided, leaving more room for increased production and disposal of substances.The Golgi apparatus is used to diffuse substances, such as removing damaged proteins from the cell.
14358	cell resperation it will give it so much oxegen to what needs the certain amout of oxygencell membrane keeps what cant fit in out and lets what is small enough to come inchannels that keep sertain thins though and would let what isnt made for that spacificaly out of the cell
14359	They use the mitochondria to send messages.
14360	Protiens control what goes out and in the cell. They let things in through holes along the membrane, only let what it needs in and out through.
14361	Cells can move substances across the cell membrane by diffusion.  Also by respiration and osmosis.  Water diffuses through the cell membrane.
14362	osmosis, is the process in which water can pass through a permeable membrane.diffusion allows little substance to pass through the cell membrane.

14365	1.Oxygen profusion- Oxygen profuses through the air over the celll membrane. 2.Cellular diffusion- The substance diffuses through the cell membrane.3. Convection- The substance goes through the cell membrane.
14366	The three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane are reproduction, storing energy and movement.  In reproduction the cell produces offspring.  Storing energy requires the cell to become more active.  Movement requires the cell to adapt to different places in the cell.
14367	The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis, active transport and passive transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy. Active transport is when molecules are getting diffused against the concentration gradient and passive transport is when molecules are diffused going with the concentration garadient
14368	Homeostasismetabolism
14369	one way is the orgenes move it.there is searten parts of the cell that let it out.

14371	The nucluesEnzymesProkayotes
14372	Cells control the movement of substances across the cell memebrane the three proceesses are: The cell membrane moves out and in cells.Also it controls all the stuff in the cell membrane.And also the cell membrane carrys stuff into the membrane.
14373	They enter through openings in the cell membrane. There they are moved throughout the cell membrane through tubes. Finally, they reach an opening and are released where they need to go.
14374	reproduction,respiration,proteins
14375	Removes waist, takes in martierials, and
14376	The cell uses openings in the membrane. They move throgh it on ribosomes.
14377	Active Transport- moves materials across the membrane.Diffusion- substances link with proteins to move across the membrane.
14378	The first process is to move it to the mitochdaine. Then they move it the to ensumyes. The final movement they make is to the cell membrane.
14379	they send out messagesthey work togetherthey dont eat each other
14380	1. The phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane. 2. Osmosis and diffusion are passively transport, meaning they go with the concentration gradient and use no energy.3. Active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient. An example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis.
14381	One way cells move is using a flagella.  It is a tale-like structure.  Another way cells move is using cilla.  These are hairlike structures on the outside of the cell.  The last way is the psudopod or false foot.  The cell sends out a part of itself and the rest follows.
14382	cell diffusion, keep some cells form moving out of the membrane.
14383	The stimulas keeps the proteins and organalles in place so that the membrane dose not let proteins move freely trough it.
14384	The three process that can be used are in meiosis which would be, prophase, interphase, and telophase. Metphase would not be used in this.
14385	1.they use long whipped like structures to move around2.the cells go and kill the bad things that dont need to be in our body 3.the cells go from place to place multiplying themselves and helping our body
14386	A cell consist of many parts to protect things from getting in. One part is the cell membrane. The cell membrane acts like an outer lining to protect the cell from harmful things getting in. The mitocodria, is another part. It carries out waste from the cell. The final part is the cell wall, found only in plants. This allowes a double protection feature to be sure things don't get in.

14393	The nuclear pores.The nucleus.Premeable acceptable.
14394	The cell membrane regulates movement in and out of the cell by monitoring what passes through.  In prokaryotic cells, an operon (consisting of 'switch' and area to latch onto) regulates the transcription of DNA.  In eukaryotic cells, cell regulation can be monitored by the removal of introns.
14395	MitosisMeiosisCell reproduction
14396	Cells use diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion to move susbstances across the membrane.  Diffusion and osmosis are types of passive transport.  Diffusion is used to regulate substances with the outside environment using the cell membrane while osmosis transports water and other liquids through the membrane.  On the other hand, facilitated diffusion is a type of active transport.  It is also a type of diffusion, albeit it uses energy to transport the substances out of the cell.
14397	passive transport is when the substance can move freely through the cell membrane.

14402	osmosis: This is where the cell lets water penatrate through membrane.
14403	The cell membrane of the cell can help it move. The nucleus of the cell can determine wether the cell can move.
14404	The cell membrane determines what can enter the cell and what can not. Lysosomes act ike 'janitors' for the cells and remove waste. The cell membrane is made up of proteins and carbohydrates.
14405	They can use ATP the takes energy to move them from place to place. Cells also use marker proteins so other cells can read where they are needed to do a job
14406	Selective permeable membrane restricts what goes through the cell membrane. Osmosis also is a selective membrane, which helps the nutrients needed go through the cells membrane.

14421	osmosis is when water is used to move around the cell membrane.
14422	The three mitocondria, amino acids, and dna
14423	anaphaseprophasetelophase
14424	One process is the cell wall because that is the outer covering of the cell so it doesn't let anything out of it.  The second process is the ribosomes because it cannot go past the cell membrane.  The third process is cell membrane itself because it also protects everything and doesn't let anything past the it so it don't touch the cell wall.
14425	Anaphase, metaphase, telaphase
14426	Active transport- uses energy to move subatances across the membranePassive transport- does not use energy to move substances across the membraneOsmosis- the diffusion of water across the membrane
14427	Three processes used by cells to control substance movement are:Nucleus- tells the cell what to do.Ribosomes- transports proteins across the cell.Endoplasmic reticulum- carries ribosomes through the cell.
14428	There is active transport, passisve  transport, and diffusion.
14429	MEOSIS,MIEOSIS,MUTATION
14430	THEY USE PLASMA, RIBOSOMES, AND MITOCHONDREA
14431	active transport, passive transport, and osmosis
14432	The three processes are,they use the nucleus,cell plasmid,and the cell membrane to control substances.
14433	The membrane is selectively permeable.  It only allows things through that it recognizes.  Some things have special entrances to the cell.
14434	TRANSCRIPTION
14435	Cells use vesicles, transport chains, and protiens to control the movement of subsatnces across the cell membrane. Vesicles eat and digest unwanted or wasted substances. When the vesicle dies, so does the cell.Transport chains carry many things across the cell. This way, equilibrium is reached, RNA can leave the cell, and many other things can occur to keep the cell going.Protions act as gates for subatances entering and leaving the cell. They open and have the particles attatch to them. They then close and open up on the opposite side. This way, things that should not go into the cell are not let in or out.
14436	Osmosis is when water comes through the cell membrane.  Other times the cell opens its membrane and allows a substance to enter.  The last type is when a substance exits the membrane may open up to allow the object out.
14437	Three processes cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: Using lipids to pass on materials, meiosis, and mitosis.
14438	1.) When an emzyne csuch as insulin attaches to a cell it tells the cell to let in sugar.2.) equalibrum is when one side has more of a protien then the other so they transfer the protiens over untill they are equal.3.)When a protien fits into a channel protien to make it change shape for a bigger protien to come through.
14439	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.
14440	photosynthesis- creattion of food for cell imersion- material going inexpulsion- material going out
14441	The plasma membrane will only let certain things in and out of the cell through
14442	1. Passive Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane, taking no energy on the cell's part.2. Facilitated Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane that requires energy, working against the gradient.3. Osmosis: Diffusion involving water.
14443	Three movements are flushing out, bursting vacoules, and breakdown of the cell.
14444	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.

14446	Cellular division, Cellular respiration, Cellular reproduction.
14447	One process is the mitocondria which  starts the movement of the cell across the membrane. Another process is the Rough ER which keeps the cell moving across the membrane. The last process is the Nucleus while is the distination of the moving cell.
14448	The process used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane, helps move wastes through the membrane and helps move water and oxygen to help the cell survive.

14453	Transcription-is when the mRNA turns into amino acids.Transfer-is when the DNA is transfered into mRNA. Translation- is when the mRNA moves towards the middle of the cell and gets ready for the t-cell to turn it into amino acids.
14454	1. active transport2. passive transport3. ficiliated difusion
14455	One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP.  ATP is active transport where the substances latch on to receptor proteins and then are able to get inside the cell.Another type of movement to allow substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.  These substances move from high concentration to low concentration.  Therefore, substances are able to move into the cell or outside of it through diffusion.A third process used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane is thier protein channels.  The protein channels allow certain things to come through.
14456	Facilitated DiffusionActive TransportPassive Transport

14464	Body, Flagellum, Feet
14465	The things that are not needed in a cell are removed by the endoplasmic rectilium. Messenger RNA carries things through the cell.
14466	One way is that the cell moves on its owe with the help of other cellsAnother way is that the cell carries what it can when it's needed to be carried out.Last way is the cell multiply's continuesly .
14467	the cell wall keeps unwanted things from coming in and across the cell membrane.
14468	The three processes are diffusion, cell movement, and also cell mutation.
14469	cells use cilia, fagella, and sutopods to move things across the membrane

14472	One of the processes is diffusion. The second one is
14473	active transport- active transport is when a cell uses energy to transport substances across the cell membranepassive transport- passive transport is when a cell transports materials across the cell membrane without the use of energyosmosis- osmosis is the transport of substances through the semi-permeable membrane (water)
14474	They swim across. They wiggle. They crawl.
14475	One of these ways is by the cell membrane. This organelle moves and allowes acces for food for the cell . The other one is cloralplast. This is a jell like thing in side the cell and it moves material through out the cell after the substance moves through the cell membrane.
14476	Three prcesses used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: defication, ribosomes, and cell pores.
14477	Diffusion is when small particles cross over the membrane from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. It does not require energy but is a way to keep the environment in which the cell is in balanced.Osmosis is the diffusion of water particles through the cell membrane. It is also relative to the environment and will move from an area of high concentration of water particles to an area of low concentration of water particles.Facilitated Diffusion is when the cell has to use energy to pass particles through the membrane. It is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration.

14481	osmosis- is the movement of water through the cell membrane. diffusion- is the movent of any substance through the cell membrane.flegella- the flegella are arms that help the cell move and let substances travel through the cell membrane.
14482	One of the processes is through cell diffusion. The second type is through the process of osmosis which pulls water through the cell. The third type is mitosis.
14483	The to enter the cell you have to use ATP energy.
14484	Three processes used by cells are diffusion, which is the movement of molecules over a selectively permeable membrane, osmosis, which involves water being passed over the membrane, and active diffusion, which requires energy from the cell to move particles through the membrane.
14485	One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.
14486	The cell wall desides what comes in and out of the cell throught its small holes that help make up the cell wall.The holes in the wall help suck in the nutrients that the cell needs.the holes also help remove waste from the cell membrane.
14487	Cells use processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, these processes are respiration, cell division, and also reproduction.
14488	One of them is that the cell membrane is selectivley permeable. The cell membrane controlls what enters and exits the cell.  The nucleus tells the cell what to do because it acts as a brain.
14489	Cells can control which amino acid strains pass through the membrane as directed by the nucleus of that cell.

14495	Three processes used by cells to control the movement across a cell membrane are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport.
14496	CARRY INFORMATION PROVIDE NUTRIENTS
14497	Cells use active transport to get anything that is bigger than a protein through the membrane. This requires energy. Cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane. The last process that cells use is called osmosis, and that is used to get water across the membrane. Neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy.
14498	The cell membrane has three processes to control the movement of substances, one being that it protects the cell, allowing only what it wants to enter and exit.
14499	Osmosis, the movement of water from one place to another. Diffusion, the movement of materials from one place to another.
14500	cells use diffusion to move subtstances across the membrane and obtain equilibrium.
14501	A cell uses diffusion, osmosis, and transportation. In diffusion, substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane. Osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane. There are two types of transport: active and passive. Active transport uses energy from the cell to move over the cell membrane while passive transport uses heat.
14502	Cells use diffition the a transport that does not use energy.  Cells use passisve transport where a sudstance comes into a cell.  Cells use active transport which a cell uses energy to grab a substance.
14503	One way is by using Cilia to move substances across the membrane with small hair-like apendages. Another way is to use Flagella long whip-like apendages used to move substances across the cell membrane. One more way to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is by releasing ribosomes.

This type of transport does not require any energy.Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis is a process by which a cell surrounds a material and brings it into the cell.  This process is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy. Endocytosis: In this process, a cell brings in molecules or substances, which requres energy.  This is a typw of active transport.

14535	Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane. Osmosis is the diffusion of water. Diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane. Another way is by facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is when the molecules move from a low concentration to a high concentration, against the concentration gradient. This type of diffusion requires ATP. A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis. Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell. This process occurs by diffusion.

14537	they use their tail for movement.proteinsnucleus
14538	One prosses of moving substances across a cell is Osmosis. This is when water masses through the cell membrane.
14539	Some cells use the cell wall as a barrier, to allow or block certain sustances from coming in.  Other particles may be too large to come through by themselves, so other cells will absorb them and carry them through.  Other cells may use osmosis as a means of transporting or disposing of certain sustances.

14543	cells change prokaryotesprotects nucleuscirculates other cells
14544	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is type of phase their on, the protein that tells when to replicate.
14545	One process that a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is the surface area. If the surface area is too large, the cell won't let any more substances move throughout the cell membrane. Another way is facilitated diffusion. This controls the amount of substances that are allowed to enter the cell.
14546	Diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside.  This process does not require any energy.Active transport is the movement of substance from a low concentration to a high one.  This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane.  The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell.
14547	There is Active transport, Passive transport, and something else.
14548	The cell can use passive transport, which allows things to freely move in and out of the cell given the concentration of the matter. Active transport uses energy from the cell to move materials against the gradient. One form of this moves materials out, called endosymbiosis. Another form moves them inside the cell, called exosymbiosis.

Solute pump: Where materials are moved into or out of a cell by a two way pump that runs off of an enzyme. It is a passive transport and an example is a sodium-potassium pump.
14558	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are reproduction, producing more organisms, movement, moving from place to place, and photosynthesis, if the organism is photosynthetic to make food.
14559	Diffusion and osmosis are two types of movement of substances across a cell membrane. diffusion is used to diffuse outwards. osmosis is used to slide over the membrane.

14561	1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2. Facilitated Diffusion- when molecules can't move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3. Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
14562	The nuclius is the brain of the cell that controls everything.  The vacuol takes all unessisary wast and bacteria out of the cell. The mitocondrian surve to maximize cellular reperation by increasing cellular communication.
14563	metosis interphase and prophase
14564	Passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell. Active transport is the use of energy to move a protien across the cell membrain. Carrier protiens use a certin type of chemical make up to control what goes into a cell. A Transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain.
14565	Osmosis is when water on each side of the membrane reaches an equalibrium.Diffusion is when any substance reaches an equilibrium across a semipermiable membrane.Facilitated diffusion is when the substance is moved from the low concentration side of  the membrane to the highly concentrated side of the membrane.

14574	One would be the cell wall, Another would be the nucleus membrain, and the last one would be the nucleus.
14575	There is osmosis, homeostasis, and diffusion across a cell memebrane. Homeostasis helps control the temperature of the cells by knowing how much fluid needs to be in a cell. Osmosis is the process of how much fluid or water is needed inside of a cell. Diffusion across a cell membrane is where it only lets in certain chemicals that the body needs. It lets out the water and other fluid inside a cell.
14576	the ER,  the nucleus, and the cytoplasm.
14577	Three processes that control the movement across a cell membrane is the sugar, ribose, and a phosphate.
14578	one thing they do is keep certain things that the cell wants in or out. This is done by a gate like strycture on the surface od the membrane. this mainly allows almost all things to get in and certain things to get out.
14579	The three process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are glycolysis, osmosis, and diffusion.  Glycolysis is anaerobic, meaning that it does not require oxygen.  Osmosis is the taking in and removing wastes or materials from the cell.  Diffusion is the movement of water across a cell- may have to deal with a hypertonic or hypotonic solution.
14580	active transport, passive transport, and
14581	Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane. The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport, also. During active transport, energy input is needed from ATP to move a substance against its concentration gradient.Cells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell. In exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. In endocytosis, the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material.
14582	Firstly, there are only so many entrances through the cell membrane that food or other things can enter through. Secondly, if the cell get to much food or other things inside of it, it will close these holes. Thirdly, there are organisms inside and outside the cell that control the flow of food

14588	Endocytosis: the cell uses energy to envelop an outside object into the cellExocytosis: the cell uses energy to envolop an inside object in order to get it out of the cellOsmosis: Water goes through the cell membrane without using energy
14589	Plasma Membrane: Jelly-like fluid that keeps the parts of the cell in place.Cell Wall: Holds all these parts in the cell, and protects the parts inside such as the nucleus. Keeps foreign organisms out of the cell.
14590	They move around the cells membrane and comunicate by signaling each other and also by comunicating with one another in oter ways they all have a funtion or job to do when in the cell membrane.
14591	Three processes used by cells to control the movement are the cell membrane, the cell wall, and the cell nucleous.
14592	SEPARATE  PASSAGESCERTAIN JOBS
14593	active transport,which is where energy is envovled.there is cellular respiration,which is the oxygen flow.

14595	cells carry them to the places they need to beas the cell goes across the membrane as the substance is being used. the substance would be used up again after the first time.
14596	Cell growth, cell division, replication.
14597	The golgi apparatus acts as a transportation system of protiens in a cell by importing and exporting the proteins. The ribosomes are protein builders in the cell and the endoplasmic reticulum controls what proteins the cell keeps.
14598	Endocytosis- Into cell. Exocytosis- Out of cell.Osomosis- Diffusion of water out of the permeable membrane.
14599	The cell uses osmosis and facilitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.
14600	One process is that the cells use their functions to move substances. Two is that differnet organelles help the cells move the substances. And the third is that the cells guide the substances to their destination.

14604	The cell membrane determines what go into the cell and what leaves the cell.
14605	They carry itwiggle it accrostglide it
14606	The carbon chains on the end of proteins on the outside of the membrane filters what goes in and out of the cell. Proteins on the inside of the membrane block out some of the things that may find a way through transprort proteins. Finaly there are proteins on the inside of the cell which can stop anything from getting into the cell.
14607	the cell has a seletively permeable membrane and uses osmosis and reverse osmosis to move material across the cell membrane.
14608	The process is called Energy Transport Chain.
14609	1. Mitochondrian carry energy.                2. Flagella makes sure everything moves properly in the cell.
14610	Osmosis can be used to diffuse water accross a membrane.An active transport can be used to move objects against the consentration gradient. Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this. It takes more energy than a passive transport.A passive transport uses a consentration gradient to move substances accross the membrane. A passive transport uses little or no energy.
14611	One process that the cell uses to control movment of substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Another procces is faciliated diffusion. The last process of movement of substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.
14612	The cell has a cell wall the controls what comes in and what comes out of the cell. there are holes on the cell wall that only certain things that the cell needs and wants to get rid of.
14613	The permiable membrane only takes in food and energy that is need. It also discards the already used substances in the cell. It also regulates osmosis.
14614	cell wall: it can allow things to enter or leave , so it can control how the movement across the cell membrane.cells move causing the movement also to be determinedhow healthy the cell is.
14615	The lipid bylear acts as a wall to block out unwanted particles and if it wants something to leave or enter it will make things like pockets and allow the particles to enter the pocket and it will close itself and allow the particle to leave. The cell also uses osmosis to allow the water to go through the cell.
14616	anaphase-interphase-metaphase-
14617	Dynamic equilibrium: the cell membrane keeps the same amout of substances in a cell as there is out.Diffusion: the movement of water across the cell membrane.Semipermeable membrane: allows some substanes to enter and others to not enter the cell.
14618	The first is osmosis where a liquid moves through the cell membrane by the process of diffusion.  Another process the cells use is that a certain substance may only enter the cell if it has the correct protein sequence.  The last process is that a substance isn't able to move across the cell membrane if it would be harmful to the cell, so the cell membrane's function is to keep these substances from getting into the cell.

14625	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis and meiosis.
14626	The cell uses the Chloroplast to move things quickly and efficently.  They also use the cell wall to keep things in so they can't loose anything.  The membrane tells everything where it needs to be and where to go.
14627	1. Waste removal: Waste is removed from the cell.2. Reproduction: If the cell gets to many materials, it gets to big to function properly, so it splits into two living organisms.3. Sponge-like surface: Selectively lets things in and out of the cell.
14628	The cell membrame, the nucleus, and the cell wall. The cell membrame lets it pass through. The nuclues controls all of the actions. The cell wall holds up a plant.

14632	The processes used by cells to control the movement of a substances across the cell membrane is movement,respiration,reproduction.
14633	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are sodium-potassium pumps, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane. Endocytosis is a process in which a group of phospholipids surrounds a substance outside of the cell in a circle and carries it in to the cell. Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead.
14634	One process used by cells to control the movement of a substance is that the nucleous. An other way the cell controls movement is when the ribosomes carry information from one  thing in a cell to another. Lastly is when the RNA and DNA make up sequences telling what should happen in  the movement of the cell.
14635	The three processes used by cells are receiving nutrients, throwing away their wastes, and carring out information to other cells.
14636	substance,structure, liquid
14637	Osmosis is a process used by cells to move water across the cell membrane. A sodium-potassium pump is a process used by cells to move sodium and potassium up the cell's concentration gradiant. In turn, the concentration gradient moves things from higher to lower concentrations across the cell membrane.
14638	The cell membrane lets things in.Protein picks up the sustance and moves it around.The substance floats in the cellmembrane.

14647	The plasma membrane helps control what crosses the cell membrane. The nuclear membrane controls what crosses the cell membrane. Diffusion helps control how much fluid crosses the cell membrane. Osmosis helps control what substances cross the cell membrane.
14648	Diffusion, selective permiabilty, and osmosis
14649	They have a cell wall which protects anything from getting in and anything going out.  They have organelles to break down proteins and get the waste out of cells.  Cells also have mitochondria that increase its surface area to add more respiration to the cell.
14650	Flagella- flagella are long  whip-like structures that help them move across an area.Cilia- cilia are hair-like structures that allow the cell to move aroundSlime- slime helps snails slide across areas.
14651	Molecules stop certain substances from getting accross, but sometimes the substances can sneak in when another substance in going in.
14652	They are what makes everything happen in our body.
14653	The three movements are anaophase telophase and peolphase.
14654	OsmosisMitosisMeosis
14655	-to keep there cell in the same shape.-to find food.-to keep diffrent bacteria out of people system.
14656	Diffusion is used which is the movement of particles across a semi permiable  membrane from a high to low concentration. Osmosis is also used which is the movment of particles from hypotonic and hypertonic solutions.
14657	The cell membrane protects the cell from anything that the cell would not like inside of it. the cell wall has the same function as the cell membrane the just do not appear on the same type of cell. A third examp-le could me the

14662	The three processes used by the cell are the making of proteins,the packing process,and the moving of the proteins out.
14663	Osmosis is movement of water across a selectively permiable membrane.Diffusion requires none of the cells energy to move substances through the cells membrane.Active transport requires the cells energy to move substances through the cell's membrane by using things such as protein channels.
14664	Passive - Goes in and out the cell without using energy
14665	The cell has a permeated membrane that allows certain things in and keeps certain things out. This also allows the cell to get rid of waste.
14666	Cells move protien to every part of your body. There are millions of cells in your body, working to fight iff infection.Cells help keep you healthy.

14672	Cells use various types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.  Osmosis is the process in which water is transfered between cells of diffrent types.  Cell membrane also detects which kind of materials allow to enter the cells and it will only allow it pass if it has a certain protein coating.
14673	One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport. Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy. Diffusion is another way of transporting substances.
14674	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane are: the cytoplasm slowing the substances and acting like a jello to control the movement, endoplasmic reticulum, and the golgi apparatus.
14675	Process one- nuclear envelope and pores allow things to travel in and out of the nucleus. Process two- Cell membrane protects the cell and also decides what can go in and out of the cell.Process three- osmosis

14680	Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane. Three ways to do this are active, passive, and diffusion. Active transport requires energy, this may use transport protiens. Passive transport does not require energy, the molecules just pass through the membrane. And diffusion is the the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.

14691	One is the ability to reproduce so quickly.     Two the rate at which and finaly they are very hard to extinct.
14692	Osmosis is used by cells to control the movement of water across their cell membrane.Diffusion is used by the cells to keep the same throughout their membranes.Homeostasis occurs so that cells keep the same throughout their membranes.
14693	The cell uses different types of proteins such as transport protein to decide what comes in or out. They cell can uses moving organelles such as a flagella to move to keep things from entering.  It has a double phosolipid bilayer to keep items from just coming in.

14701	The process that is used to move substances from one side of the cell membrane to the other is diffusion.  Diffusion is the movement of solid substances across the cell membrane.  Another one is called osmosis and that is when liquid substances are moved acorss the membrane from higher concentration to lower concentration areas.
14702	Moving from the golgi bodies to the cell wall by visicles is one way. Taking Ribosomes from the Rough ER to the golgi bodies is another. Mitosis could be another way of movement.

14718	Three types of controlled movement of substances across the cell membrane include: passive transport, active transport, and diffusion. Passive transport is when they go with the gradient. Active transport is when they go against the gradient. Diffusion is the moving of water molecules throughout the cell.
14719	The cell uses energy to control the movement.The cell nucleus can control the movement.The proteins in the cell can control the movement.
14720	blood vescles send blood through the body. The immune system uses white blood cells to block off bacteria.

14741	One process is osmosis which controls how much water comes in and out of the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis are used to control the what substances enter and leave through the plasma membrane. Facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell. Selective permeability is a process that allows certain things in the cell and keeps certain things out.
14742	1. Osmosis- particles move through the cell membrane if there is an unequal concentration of the substance on each side of the cell membrane.2. Proteins- a cell could call some protiens to move particles from outside of the cell inside the cell or vice versa. The proteins would sit on the membrane and shoot particles through.3. phagocytosis- a cell will 'eat' another cell.
14743	Respiration- what cells use to liveReproduction- devolopement of new cellTranslocation- moved to different place about the cell
14744	some cells use tale like structurs called fegilia to move. others use use cilia or slide.
14745	Diffusion is the movement of low concentration to high concentration in the cell membrane. Osmosis is the movement of water going from a low concentration to a high concentration in the cell membrane.
14746	The cell moves its way to the cell membrane by fighting off the fungus.  Then it goes through the stages. Then gets to the cell membrane.
14747	The cell stretches its body to move .
14748	1-The substances travel through the membrane in a normal fashion. throught the pathways2-The membrane envelopes the substance and pulls it into the cell.
14749	the cell membrane is permeable and allows substances to enter and leave the cell.
14750	One proccess used by cells is diffusion were the food is slowly allowed to pass through the membrane. Another proccess is when a food particle is surrounded until it is taken into the cell.
14751	1. A cell is protected by a ridged cell membrane causing it to stay in place.2. A cell has flalgia, that are finger like projections, allowing it to move.3. A cell has cilia, that are hair like projections, allowing it to move.

14756	AnaphaseProphaseTelophase
14757	It uses small hair like structures to move around. They move back and forth across the membrane to move. then the substance can be moved any where on the cell.
14758	One process a cell uses is called osmosis. Osmosis helps the water transport all throughout the cell and on a permeable membrane.Another process a cell uses is called active transport because substances in the cell are being transported through the membrane to the different organelles.The other process that a cell uses is called oxygen diffusion. The oxygen is being moved around the cells to keep the body from not functioning right. It also makes it able for the cells to stay alive and not die off.
14759	Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell. Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane. Passive transport is whe a substance does not require the use of energy to be moved out of the cell.
14760	First there is the cell wall in plant cells that block unwanted things from entering the cell. They are there to protect the cell from getting bad things in it like a virus or bacterium or just usless things.  in the cell membrane there is a hole for things like RNA to pass through things still need to enter the cell for the cell to do its job( whatever that may be).
14761	Cells can Osmosis which is the process of which water passes accross a cell membrane. The cell membrane also has small gaps which limit the things that go into the cell, if something to large attempts to go in it will get stuck
14762	the mitocondria help keep dead cells off the cell membrane, golgi apparatus helps keep the substances moving
14763	isotonic: where there is the same amount of a substance in and outside the cell so the volumes are the sameHypertonic: where that amout of a sunstance is greater on the outside of a cell so it moves in through the semipermiable membraneosmosis: where a substance moves in and out of the cell
14764	The first process that cells use is diffusion. Cells have membranes that control what makes it into the cell and what cannot get inside the cell. The second process cells use are tunnel-like objects. Certain tunnels only can carry certain substances across the membrane and into the cell, such as a tunnel only being used for carbon. The third process cells use is called osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane. Water is a very simple and easy to carry molecule, so it easily diffuses, unless there is a balance of water on the inside and outside of the cell-equilibrium.
14765	The cells use the cell membrane to control what comes in and out of the cell.Because if anything harmful comes in the cell it could damage the newly made cells.And if those get damaged then the cells will not be made or funtion properly.
14766	three  processes include mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.
14767	The cell wall keeps everything inside the cell. The vacuole takes out any unhealthy stuff. The mitochondria keeps everything moving and aligned.
14768	Homostasis
14769	Diffusion, this distibutes molecules evenly.Osmosis, water distributing evenly. Active Transport, the cell itself using energy to move materials.
14770	passive transport- doesnt require energyactive transport-requires energy
14771	One process used by cells to control the movement of substances is Mitosis, which splits the cells. Another process is Miosis which splits the cells again, and the third process used by cells is Mutation.
14772	Cells have receptors on their outside, that are in the phospholipid bilayer, that only allow substances in if they match up to the receptors perfectly. Cells also use a process in which they form a 'bubble' around a substance (endocytosis) that they want to bring into the cell (this uses ATP). Another process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the membrane is exocytosis, which is when the cell gets rid of substances by forming a 'bubble' around the substance and sending it out of the cell. This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal.
14773	The use of RNA  MRNA     and singnals let iff by DNA
14774	One way would be be active transport. Another way would be by
14775	Cells use the membrane to move transporter proteins in and out, Also marker proteins.
14776	They can be carried by another organism or could be floating around. Get attached to something then it moves them.
14777	they use messanger thing they takek them and som other things i really dont rember so ye but that was my little thing and you people suck makeing us take the stupid tests
14778	First the substances travel through the ER then they go through the golgi apperatice. Then the substances travel out of the cell.

14780	transportaion, translation, diffision, transportaion-the way they get around translation- the way they moved thorugh the membrain
14781	The cells help movement across the membrane by keeping stuff like bacteria out of the membrane and it always keep the cell in motion and using the membrane.
14782	cellular respiration which helps the movement digestive system, how the organism gets food and how it reproduces
14783	cells use vacuoles to break down any free living substances, cellular respiration for the cell to breathe, use the membrane to keep out any unwanted substances.
14784	Diffusion- when substances are moved from a high consintrasion to a lower consintratsion.Osmoius- when water moves through the cell membrane.
14785	1. Whip like tail- helps move it along.2. Fins- helps it swimOR3. Flexible body- moves by itself.
14786	Osmosis - Allows water to pass through the cell membrane.Diffusion - Allows substances to pass through membranes.RNA - trasfers information through cell membranes.
14787	The nucleus controls what moves in and out of the membrane.If harmful substances are entering, then cells will decrease yet they will reproduce at the same rate.
14788	movement reproduction transportation
14789	First would be that the cell membrane would squish in different direction to allow substances to cause no harm. Second would be that maybe the membrane would do the exact opisite and would resist any impact. Last the membrane might be to move the membrane around to make substances roll off the membrane.
14790	Air, Water, Oxygen     One process of movement across a cell membrane would be from air getting under the substance in the cell.  The next process of movement would be liquids getting under the substance and carrying it across the cell.  Last it would be by oxygen, this oxygen also gets underneath the substance and carries it across the cell.
14791	It moves by the force of the enxymes across the cell membrane.
14792	they wiggle they have a tail and they have a something else
14793	They use different types of systems depending on the proccess that the cell needs done.

14806	One type of movement acrossed the membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is when the substance uses water to move across the membrane. Another processes is active transport. Active transport is the processes of moving acrossed the membrane by the membrane being selectivly permeable. The last processes is difussion. Diffusion is when the cells  diffuse so that they can move across the selectivly permeable membrane.
14807	They get rid of nutrients they dont need.They use different cells to do certain jobs.
14808	The cell uses it organells and cell wall and membrane to controll what gos in and comes out.
14809	Three processed used by cells to control the movement of subtances across the cell are called the cilia, flagnelle, and the something else.
14810	The ribosomes decide what enters and leaves the cell. The nucleus lets the waste exit the cell membrane. And, the mitochondria decides at times what can enter.
14811	The endoplasmic reticulum helps proteins travel through the cell.  Transcription and translation also take place in the cell.
14812	One process is habitat location.Second process is homeostasis.Third process is geographical isolation.

14822	1.Bacteria2.Viruses3.Vacoules
14823	One movement is passive movement. Passive movement alows substances to move freely through the cell membrane. The second movement requires an activation energy for substances to pass through. The third movement is when substances go through using proteins.
14824	cell diffusionosmosis
14825	The cells use the endoplasmic reticulum and as a highway to move proteins out and around the cell's insides. Also the use of trucking which carries the proteins throughout the endplamic reticulum. Messenger uses the cell to give messages or instructions to the ribosomes from the nucleus.

14829	In diffusion the surface of the cell decised what substances go in and out of the cell. In mitosis the things inside the cell are used to move and function in the cell.In meiosis sustances pass throught the wall of the cell and do tings that help the cell do things.
14830	They control osmosis and diffusion. This is the movement of water across the membrane.  They also allow children to be made.  They are copied form the parents and travel across the membranes. They also attack sickness in the body especially at open wounds.

14841	There are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane. One of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in, with treh cell membrane moving around it, therefore positioning it inside treh cell. Another way is that treh cell 'opens up' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then 'closing' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech.

14855	The three process that are used to control the movement of substances cross the cell membrane is
14856	One is the mitocondria which controls what goes in and out of the cell. Second, is the vacole which is the stomach of the cell. Last, is the membrane which is the control center of the cell.
14857	Cells use three different methods to control movement of foreign substances. One for example would be diffusion. It controls the water that moves in and out of a cell. Another example would have to be that the cell wall uses methods to control what comes in and out. They have many specialized glands/openings that allow specific things to enter and leave the cell.

14861	Diffusion is the movement of water across the cell membrane.Cell wall keeps things in and out of the cell membrane.The selective membrane lets the good things in and keep the bad things out.
14862	One decription of a way the cell controls movement is by it's cell wall. The cell wall protects and sheilds the cell.     Another decription of a way the cell controls movement is by the nucleus. The nucleus keeps the cell functioining.     Lastly, another way the cell controls movement is by ribosomes.
14863	Three processes a cell uses to move particles through the cell membrane are through the Carrier portein, Pump protein and the Tunnel Protein.
14864	The cellia it has little tails that make a cell move, the water vain that go to the membran of the cell, and the memebran that controls the every thing to make the cell move.
14865	There are three different types of proteins used to transport  substances across the cell membrane.  These three proteins are transport, receptor, and glycoproteins.  Transport proteins transport things directly through the cell membrane, as long as they fit.  Receptor proteins check to see if the thing attemtping to pass through are good for the body or not, and let them through accordingly.  Glycoproteins only open for certain substances to be passed through the cell membrane.
14866	Protein synthesis and cell division.

14868	Actice Transport.Passice Transport.Facilitative Diffusion.
14869	The cell membrane allows the material to get into the cell and materail from the cell to move out. The sugars go to the protein and forms the cell's protective layer. Then the enzymes go through the gateway type of process which allows enzymes to switch from one side to the other of the cell membrane. Then the cell membrane lets material go out of the cell and inside of the cell.

14879	3 processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are Ion channels, which use a channel protein to move things in and out of the cells, Diffusion, which is moving a substance from a high concentration to low concentration, and Hypotonic diffusion which taking in substances.
14880	Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Diffusion is another movement of substances across the membrade of the cell. Bionary fusion is another process where the cell membrane 'opens up' to let a substance in that is too big to go in the cell membrane alone.
14881	Carrier protiens move them through the cells membrane by opening like a gate. Flagella whip substances across the surface of the cell. Pores open to allow small enough substances to pass through the membrane.

14885	Their is active transport, passive transport, and then their is gradient transport. Active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell. Passive transport is where subtances pass through the memebrane with out the cell using energy to bring subtances.
14886	here are three processes used by cells to control movement a dog and a cat and a human.
14887	The cell membrane is used to control the movement of substances across a cell. The cell membrane may block out harmful substances, and the cell membrane will also let substances needed for the process into the cell. The cell membrane is very permable.
14888	The cell uses the cell wall and the cell membrane to help it move substances through the cell.  These help regulate what gets into the cell and what doesn't.  Once inside the cell the nucleus will decide what is done with those substances.
14889	Cells use diffusion to let substances permiate its membrane.Cells use facilitaded diffusion or use energy to help the substance pass through its membrane.Cells use passive diffusion or dont use energy to help the substance pass through its membrane.
14890	Three types of movement that cells use to move substances acrossed the membrane are, one is osomis. Osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Diffusion is also one, during diffusion a substance moves from high to low concertration.
14891	The cells have three different processes, one is that the cell helps control movement of things in the cell. Another one is that the cell has cytoplasm that holds all the things together in the cell.
14892	Three processes used by cells to control the movement  of a cell is mitchodria, cyplast, and cell wall.
14893	Cells can transfer substances, make more or give substances.
14894	Diffusion is the process cells use to move liquid materials inside and out of the sell by passing through the cell membrane. Respiration is the process cells use to move needed to take in the materials needed to survive and output materials used by other organisms. Excretion is the process used by cells to remove waste products and unnecessary nutrients.
14895	One process is through absorbing the substance into the cell. Another process would be by certain parts of the membrane haveing different roles to fill by having a certain hole in their area this lets larger objects get through the membrane easily and effectively.
14896	flagellun, cell membrane, cell
14897	One way would be that the plasma membrane controls what comes in and out of the cell. Another way would be from osmosis. Also a way would be through diffusion.
14898	Reproduction- is produsing mre offsprings.
14899	The cell membrane use the receptors of the cell to send out messages of needs to be done. The processes are to find out what needs to be done, fix it and make sure that what was sent out is what was received.
14900	There are several processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Three processes are exocytosis, endocytosis, and phagocytosis.
14901	the cell wall protectsthe cell from substances coming in or going out of the cell.
14902	Selective Permiability- selects what substances get in and out of the cellActive Transport- which requires movement and creates  an opening for substances to movePassive Transport- doesnt require movement of cells to move substances
14903	blood flow.
14904	Cells have a selective membrane which only allow certain things to enter and leave the cell. It controls, for example, how much water leaves and enters the cell. Cells also use proteins as means to transport things through the cell to other cells.
14905	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.

14910	The three processes used be cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: active transport, photosynthesis, and hyperactive transport.
14911	DIFFFUSION, or the spontaneous movement of a substance from a high concentration to a low concentration zone;FACILITATED DIFFUSION, or when diffusion occurs through special protein channels located in the cell membrane;ACTIVE TRANSPORT, meaning that the cell invests ATP in order to transport substances in or out of the cell up the concentration gradient by special protein pumps.
14912	The three processes that the cells use to control movement across the cell membrane are the cell wall, mitosis, and osmosis.
14913	first thing would be there round small shape helps them flow all around the body.second thing would be the mebrane inside the cell, it can give enrgy to help it move and live.therd thing is the function it has in the body. only so that the body notice what it is and it allows it to get to where it needs to go.

14915	There is a protien. requires energy, water can pass through plasma membrane easily.
14916	The cells can control the movement of substances across the membrane by slowing them down, and blocking out certain substances. They might allow certain substances to come in, but others cannot.

14924	The cytoplasm, flagullum, and the shape of the substances
14925	Cells can use their cell wall to control movement of substances by not letting the substances into the cell.
14926	Well there is the process of the nucleus saying hey i need more of this and send it up to the brain.  Then the tRNA goes out and deleviers the message to where ever it needs to go.  When the message gets to where it needs to be then that thing makes it and then it gets transfered to the brian since that is where it is need.

14933	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.
14934	1. Kreb cycle when they move carban and oxygen around to make ATP2. Calvin cycle when they use oxygen to make a little ATP3. Active Transport that moves the cells around to make ATP
14935	Cellular Respiration, it releases oxygen keeping the substances from moving.Photosynthesis, it uses ATP to create glucose.The cell wall protects the substances from moving any further.

14948	endocytosis- cell membrane envelopes material and is absorbed into the cell.diffusion- concentration gradient is higher outside the cell causing the material to naturally diffuse across the membrane.facilitated diffusion- carrier proteins help materials move with the concentration gradient through the cell membrane.
14949	Exocytosis is one process in which cell control movement across the cell membranes in which it exits substances out of the cell.Endocytosis is the process in which the susbstances move from outside the cell into the cell membrane and inside the cell.Isotope is the process in which the substances come and go  equal in and  out the cell but in a balanced way.

14962	The cell controls the movement of substances around the membrane by controling it
14963	The Cell Membrane will act like a body guard and say weather or not an object or organism can make its way into the cell.  The cell may use asmosis to tranfer material across the cell.  The nucleus is the brains of the cell and it will tell if something is supposed to be there or not.
14964	Cells use diffusion and osmoisis to move substances across the cell membrane. Diffusion is substances moving from an area with more mass to an area with less mass. Osmoisis is the movement of water through the cell membrane. A cell membrane also has pores that particles can enter and exit from.
14965	One process is diffussion. Diffusion is whenever substances diffuse over the cells membrane. Another process is the fission where the substances go through a hole in the membrane.
14966	One movement in the cell is the RNA. Another thing that moves cells is energy.  Another is passive transportation.
14967	they grow legs and run away
14968	The cell does through movements to control the cell membrane is the cell wall. It control what enters and leaves they cell.flegall helps the cell move.
14969	They can use their cilia, flagella or they could not move at all.
14970	Cells have semi-permeable membranes, which allow particles to pass through cell walls, others have permeable membranes, which allow particle to move freely through the cells walls, and other cell walls are not permeable at all, allowing nothing to pass through.
14971	the ribosomes produce the energy for the cellthe golgi appartatus gets rid of waste and the nucleus hold all the information and DNA
14972	1. In through cell wall2. Out of Nucleus3. Out through cell wall
14973	Osmosis controlls how much water can be inside the cell. The cell has a cell memberane that only lets certain things into and out of the cell. There are tiny little holes in the memberane that can only fit certain sized things into the cell, so if the thing that is trying to get into the cell is too big, then it will not be able to get into the cell.
14974	cellular respiration, ion channle, lipid bilayer
14975	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.
14976	The cell is connected to the membrane and by chanelling the membrane it tells it to move. Protins also send messages to the cell to tell it to move. The cell and cells are linked and communicating all the time.
14977	they processes by cells central movement. They can move by a roddili (spiral).They can process or control their movement by flagella.
14978	a cell controls the movement so it can contrarn the so it can get DAN to the place it needs it.
14979	Flaggelum is used to move. Also in mRNA.
14980	1.They use sodium-potassium pumps to move sodium and potassium in and out.    2.They use vacules to ingulf food through phagocytosis.3. They use markers to deside if the substance is ok to travel into the cell.
14981	The cells use the cell wall to limit movement across the cell.also uses energy.

14988	The cell membrane is the cell structure in which any subtance moves across because it is the outer part of the cell and allows anything to pass on top of it.The cytoplasm that is on the cell membrane is a very helpful factor to help things move across the membrane.All cells have a special ability to move across the cell membrane. They have a flagellum that is a tail-like structure that enables the cell to move.
14989	Flagella is one of the three processes.
14990	diffusion - movement of cellsosmosis - movment of cells using watercell division - dividing of cells

14997	The cell moves across it by diffusion, respiration, and movement.
14998	cytoplasm keeps things where they are.
14999	Flagella can move a protist around, mitochondria moves throughout the membrane, and the lysosomes hold in food for energy, then, when needed, the food is let out.

15012	1. the nucleus controls the whole cell and its actions.2. the mitocondria makes proteins the cell needs to survive. 3. the cell membrane is the gateway of the cell it controls what enters and exits the cell.
15013	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are cell membrane, cell wall, and vascular system.
15014	1. nuclear membrane2. enyzme 3.
15015	Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane. One major type of cellular movement is passive transport. With passive transport, the cell won't have to use any energy to move the substance. The cell can use diffusion, or osmosis if the cell is moving water. The cell can also use active transport to move substances. It can use endocytosis, to bring substances into the cell, or exocytosis to push substances out.
15016	One is osmosis where different parts of the cell come together to protect and control movement from the cell membrane.  The second is transcription where it controls the rate and what crosses through the cell membrane. The third is translation it helps create rna that can help later on to control what crosses the membrane.
15017	osmosis, mitosis, and meiosis
15018	First of all, cells have a semi-permeable membrane that allows only what the cell wants to allow in.  Second, cells use the cytoplasm in the cell to move and hold different substances and items that are in the cell.  Last of all, some cells have a cell wall that doesnt allow anything in, except for a few spots where the wall is discontinued.
15019	1. tRNA2. lysosomes3. other organelles
15020	First the tranportation of materials the cell needs to survuve. Seconed the transportation of waste out of the cell. And Third the transportation of nutieants to the body and other cells that need it.
15021	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, are :diffusion, miosis, and movement.
15022	cells use cyotplasm for certain things to move through the human body. Cells also use blood to move certain proteins and cells through the body.
15023	Cells use oasis, mitosis, and miosis.  It helps water and other materials go from cell to cell.
15024	active transport, diffusion, passive transport
15025	Wall cells are in plants to keep the strucure of it.
15026	One of the processes used by cells would be the The NUCLEOUS to tell the cell what to do. Then there is the FLAGELUM Which is the tail the moves to help the crell move around. The last one would be the CELL MEMBRAIN That holdeverytjing in and not floting out.
15027	osmosis, active transport, diffusion
15028	Cell respiration, cell movement, and cellular activation
15029	Cells can multiply.Cells can help organs.Cells also move throughout the cell membrane in order to keep everything funtioning correctly.
15030	Diffusion:  movement of materials from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.Osmosis:  moving of water across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration.Sodium-Potassium pump:  movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane, being replaced by sodium ions.  (Results in the feeling of something (pain, heat, cold.))
15031	Diffusion which is the processes of moving materals in and out of the cell, osmosis which is the procsess of water moving in and out of the cell, and fermentation which controls the proteins coming in and out of the cell
15032	blood movement cells
15033	The three processes used by a cell to control movement of substances across the membrane are...
15034	Active Transport is when what substances use to cross the cell, Passive Transport is what the substances use to help control the cell.
15035	Three processes to control the movement are diffusion, osmosis, and facultative diffusion. Osmosis is the spread of water through an area. Diffusion is when water is used in various parts of the organism and stored throughout the body. Facultative diffusion is when the nutrients are stored to be used for later.
15036	Difusion, helps move water based particels in and out of the cell. Osmosis:  move non water based particels in ond out of the cell.
15037	The proteins only allow for specific organisms to pass through. The cell membrane is made of material which only nonpolar organisms can pass through.
15038	Diffusion is where the cell moves things acrost the membrain without using energy. Active trasport is a prosses that requires energy to move things acrost the cell.
15039	Mitochondrian, plasmids, and the ribosomes.
15040	All the membranes are different from evrey other one.
15041	Diffusion is one processes used by cells to cntrol movement across the cell membrane.

15046	The cell membrane will only allow RNA through. The flag lets it know where to enter. Then it will only let waste out.
15047	Diffusion
15048	cell wall cell membrane nucleus
15049	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

15051	1.substances move through the organelles2.tRNA transfers it across the cell3. transcription
15052	Active transport helps with the flow of water in the membrane. Protein transport helps bring enzymes into the cell. The channel proteins, 'V' shaped, move things in and outside of the cell. Also, carrier proteins, tube shaped, move things in and outside of the cell.Passive transport helps bring proteins into the cell.
15053	The cell uses threee processes by the names of mieosis, mitosis, and cell reproduction. Meosis is when the cell divides and turns into another cell aloowing them to increase in numbers. Mitosis Is when the cell membrane forms around the nucleus to protect it. ( this only occurs in Eukaryotic cells ).Cell reprodustion is when cells multiply allowing more cell to be created and a person be healthier.
15054	Substances go through the cell.
15055	Endocytosis. Endocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to transport large substances into the cell. Exocytosis. Exocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to tranport large out of a cell.Ion channels. Ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell.
15056	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell are, one the cell wall, which is used to keep things out of it and another one is the mitochondria maximizes cellular respiration by and lysomes take unwanted proteins out of the cell.
15057	1. Active transport - uses enery to move subtances through a carrier protien to the rest of the cell2. Facilitated transport - does not use energy to move substances through a carrier protien3. Passive transport - the suctances move right on through the membrane with using any energy.
15058	The cell membrane will open allowing and manuever nutrients into the cell. The cell membrane will manuever waste out of the cell.
15059	flagellum i dont know
15060	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.
15061	Three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are growth, synthesis and growth 2.
15062	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane are *cytoplasm in the cell*the nucleoids in the cell*the nucleaus controls everything in the cell
15063	three prosses that control the movement of a substance is the passive active and transport
15064	Osmosis allows water to move freely around inside and outside the membrane of the cell.  Diffusion allows wastes to exit the ceels throught selected pores in its membrane.  The lipids and proteins aloow any nutrient to go through the surface of the cell.
15065	The cell wall or membrian lets the substance into the cell then the ribosions tak eover and start to break down the substance, and finale mitocondrean destro and eat the substance and use it as food.
15066	osmosisexocytosis is where they take large objects out of a cell with vesiclesendocytosis is where the cell takes in objects
15067	1) Mitosis- the cells seperate and move to opposite ends of the cell membrane. Which can somewhat guard the movements.2) Meosis- The same process occurs as in mitosis, except more cells will be produced. Gaining more control for the cells. 3) Reproduction: the cells can reproduce many time, then the cells can have full controll over the cell memebrane. Making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane.
15068	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.
15069	1. Selection- The membrane selects what is going and is coming out.
15070	The flagellum is used for movement across the cell membrane.Proteins.

15072	The cell membrane keeps the things from going in and out.
15073	Controls what goes in and out, allow substances to get in,and removes any thing that's not suppose to be in there.
15074	Three processes used by the cell are the mitochondria stopping substances, the cell wall not letting substances into the cell and the nucleus regulaating the cells movement.
15075	The cell uses mitochondria on the cell membrane to move substances across. Also, the cell membrane can control what substances goes in and out, and it can block out certain substances. Lastly, the cell could use flagella to help move the substances also.
15076	sperm and egs
15077	mitosisosmosismeiosis
15078	One process is when the ribosomes transport the genetic code across the ER, which can be smooth or rough.
15079	The cell wall serves as a wall to keep things from getting into the cell. In order for things to move across the cell membrane they have to get in the cell wall.A substance may use their flagellium to move across the cell membrane.
15080	The cell can use the Goolgi the move food and things around. The  cell membrane also control what comes in and out of the cell.
15081	One way the cells controll movement of substances across the cell membrane is through it. A second way is to go across it. And the third way is to go out of it.
15082	osmosis, meiosis, mitosis
15083	osmosis the substances absorb into the celldiffusion they diffuse threw out the membraneactive transport helps move on thing to another
15084	Tails are used to move cells around.They also use tiny hairs to swim around.
15085	The cell must know what is going across the memebrane friest so it knows if it has to keep it or get ride of it because its bad for the cell. The next thing the cell should do is keep all organisms that they know they need to surive.
15086	diffusion the golgi and the rough endoplasmic reticulum
15087	The 3 processes used by cells to control movement are osmosis, diffusion and active transport.
15088	the cell membrane controls what the cell does and how it functions.cellulair respiration is a process by which cells carry oxygen to the blood stream.the mitochondria is how the cells get energy.
15089	For cells to move some use the flagellum. It is like a tail and moves so the cell can reach it's destination. Other cells also scatter around until it find the right place. Last but not least alot of cells have tiny hairs that have a certain movement to get it where it needs to go.
15090	There is a endoplasmic reticulum that acts like a guide in the cell. Then there is flagella in the cell that helps control the movement. There is also cytoplasm that helps the control.
15091	miosis, mitosis, and
15092	Osmosis- diffusion of water.Meiosis- cell reproduction.Mitosis- another type of cell reproduction.
15093	Potassium pump, diffusion, exocytosis.

15100	cilli microvilla an villa
15101	Osmosis is the process where water flows in and out of the cell membrane.Active transport uses energy to move molecules throught he membrane of a cell.Passive transport is a process where molecules move through the cell membrane without the use of energy.
15102	The endoplasmic reticulum carries things through the cell. It is like a highway. The cell moves water in and out of the cell in the process of trranspiration.  It does this to maintain homeostasis The cell moves oxygen in and carbon dioxide of out of the cell through the process of cellular respiration.  it also does this to maitian homeo stasis.
15103	they use there body movments
15104	selective promobility is one way that the cells control the substances
15105	Cells control the movement of substamces across the cell membrane by not allowing any harmful substances through the membrane, being simi-permiabel by controling what can and can't go through the membrane, and going throug exocytosis to get rid of any harmful waste inside the cell.

15109	the nuclues sends messages to the cell to tell things what to do and what is happening. the ribosomes are little things that helps build energy and theres also the cytoplasm that runs through the cell membrane.
15110	MieosisMitosis
15111	The cell wall is one-it only lets certain substances enter the cell.The cytolasm is a substance that fills the cell with a jelly material.The vacuoles moves throughout the cell getting rid of certain substances.
15112	The cell membrane blocks certain things from entering and leaving the cellCells membranes fight off any mircroorganisms that try to enter and arnt supposed tooIf the cell membrane doesnt recognize it it wont let it in
15113	The cell membrane can control what moves into and out of the cell. Mitosis is when the cell divides and and that can help move things across the cell membrance. The cell need to grow and divide or else it would become to big and explode. If it didn't control what moves into and out of it we would most likely die.
15114	The membrane surface in a cell is referred to as being 'semi-permeable.' This means that only certain things are capable of entering the cell. Therefore, the membrane would regulate what enters or leaves the cell. With these particular processes happening, the travel of substances across the cell membrane would be limited.
15115	They absorb the substance into the cell, they surround the substance with the cell membrane, or they keep the substance out of the cell.
15116	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Diffusion always substances to move across the cell by slowly being moved through the cell membrane. Facititated diffusion always larger objects to be moved across the cell membrane. Osmosis is where something is moved into the cell by shrinking it and then it regains its shape after being moved into the cell.
15117	The cell membrane checks to see if the substance is good or bad for the cell. Then the cell membrane lets the substance inside of the cell. Finally the substance is transported through the cell through the endoplasmic reticulum.
15118	MIOSISOSMOSISREPRODUCTION
15119	Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.
15120	Osmosis is water coming in or leaving the cell.Diffusion is making equilibrium by moving across the membrane.Passive transport is where you move things into the cell from the outside.
15121	anaphase interphase and prophase
15122	They might have a Flagtum or whip like tail to move.
15123	The three processes are diffusion, faciliated diffusion, and osmosis.
15124	meioses, cell division, geting rid of waste.
15125	Cells use different processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. One of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through. This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.
15126	The three phases I know are metaphase,anaphase, and telophase.

15131	One is active transport which takes energy to pass through the cell membrane.
15132	they can move across water. They eat the other fish. The can swim
15133	Cells first recognize what is going to be comming through the membrane by sending a singnal to the nucleus so it then cna decide whethere or not whatever wants to enter can. Then the Golgi bodies transport whatever it is through the cell.
15134	Three processes used by the cell to control movement of sudstances would be citoplasma, nucius, and mitocondrean.
15135	Three processes are that the cell has a cell wall and is connected to other cells. Another is that it chooses what to enter it and it acts like a barrier for other things.
15136	telephase gives the information to the nucleusAnaphaseInterphase
15137	They use the cytoplasm to move substances to their right place,

15156	They have layers which regulate what can enter and exit the cell membrane. They have a screen-like function that detects weather or not a substance is sizable to enter the membrane.
15157	They have cytoplasm, which holds all the organelles and substances in the membrane.  They have a cell membrane which keeps organelles and substances inside the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum also moves the substances around.

15161	Osmisis, one using energy, one not using energy
15162	The first procees used to control movement of substances across the cell membrane would be trascription, which takes protein and turns it into mRNA. Translation takes mRNA and decodes it for the cell to read and use. Osmosis is another process, used by cells. Osmosis makes the fluid in a cell try and reach equalibrium.
15163	One type of movement control is passive transportation.
15164	eye spot, flagellum and contracule vacule
15165	One would be reproducton.
15166	There are three processes that I know of that are used by cells and they are passive and active. Passive means that the substance is able to pass right through. Active is when it has to go through a process to go through the cell memebrane. Diffusion is another one. Substances diffuse to go through the cell membrane.
15167	Through regeritationThrough blood flow Through urination
15168	Diffusion- Sugar is absorbed into the membrane and travels down the gradient level.Faciliated Diffusion- Requires energy to move down the gradient.Active Transport- Particles are held in a 'pocket', then are brought to the membrane and are released out of the cell.

15173	cell division, cellular respiration, cell wall
15174	Diffusion, which allows materials to pass in and out, osmosis, through which water passes through the membrane, and active transport, in which specialized processes transport materials past the membrane.
15175	They let substances in  and out through the membrane.  all the organs in the cell have a suspecific job to do to get what the cell needs
15176	Cell membranes let go of waste, eat and engulf food and can block bad stuff from getting in.
15177	They are transfered.They carry the substances.
15178	Cells use different organels inside the cell to move substances across it. Three processes of moving substances would be, using the mitocondria to move waste from the cell. The cell wall also helps filter and move waste in and out of the cell. The cell nucleus controls what goes in and out of the cell as well. That's a few ways cells use movement.
15179	they control the movement across the cell mambrane by taking control of each individual part of the cell.
15180	DiffusionRespirationOmnosis
15181	Cells use vacules to allow water in and out of the cell.Cells use osmosis to allow the movent of water acrossed the cell or into the cell.
15182	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be that they; 1. The cell cycle 2. reproduction
15183	Meiosis is used throughout the cell membrane to control and develop more cells. MRNA and RNA are used as messengers to carry the information to the needed destination. Lastly, the information is received and it has ended,
15184	tRNA, mRNA, rRNA
15185	Three processes that control the movement of substances across the cells membrain are equalibrium, the consentration gradiant and cell division. the consentration gradiant is when the partical move from higher consentration to lower consentration. If the cells consentration gradient is to high it can brust or if it is to small it will shring so it has to be normal.

15190	The cell membrane controls what goes in and out of the cell. The nuclues is the brain of the cell and it controls what goes on inside the cell. The cell wall is barrier to sources outside of the cell and protects the cell.
15191	They use ribosomes to carry stuff around the cell.The nuclieus is the brain, that helps controll the cell.The cell is small enough to move stuff across it.
15192	the cells are movement  of substances

15208	There are three different types of processes a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The first type of movement is called active transport, which is when the cell is physically doing something. The second type of movement is called passive transport, which is when the cell itself if inactive and the person is doing the work. The third type of movement is osmosis which is the diffusion of water.
15209	energybloodother
15210	They use the flagellum to move, therefore it could help move things across the membrane. Also the muscles, like with blood flow, and finally the heart because it pumps blood and oxygen all over the body.
15211	Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.
15212	Endocytosis is used to let large mollecules into cells. Exocytosis is used to get them out of the cells.
15213	Three processes used to control cell movement are,
15214	mitosos, meisosis are two ways that cells control the movement across the cell membrane because they are the cycles where new cells are formed.
15215	Cillia, flagella, and
15216	Digestion.Respiration.Inversion.
15217	On the cell membrane there are little holes that are selectivley premable, which allows only certian things to cross and not cross into the cell.
15218	One way you can transfer substances through a cell is by the use of water or otherwise known as Osmosis. A second way you could transfer substances is by transfering enzymes through the cell membrane. A third way substances get transfered through the cell membrane is using mRNA to transfer proteins through the cell.
15219	1. Flagella.2. plasma membrane.3. mitochondria
15220	Cell wall-blocks unwanted material from getting inCytoplasm-helps regulate RNA
15221	OSMOSSES' DIFUSSION AND THE MEMBRAINE
15222	When a cell needs energy, or food, the plasma membrane lets the food inside of the cell where it is processed by mitochondria. On the cell membrane, there is a series of locking nodules that prevent unwanted substances from entering the cell. Also, things like cilia and flaggellum aid in cell movement and could also possibly aid in the movement of substances.
15223	mitosis moving cells.
15224	The three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are mitosis, meiosis, and passive. Passive is when substances can get through easily. meiosis is also the process how cells divide as mitosis is too.
15225	The nucleus helps control the movement of substances across a cell membrane by telling the substance where to go.The cell wall also helps guide it through keeping the nucleus from getting stuck or trapped in something  because the cell wall is  there to protect it and keep unneeded things out.
15226	1. Osmosis: the differation of water across a membrane.2. Active Permeability: the ability of a membrane to control what flows in and out via special organelles. This is done with carrier proteins that carry the materials 'against the grain'.3. Free-flow permeability: Permeability in which the materials naturally flow into or out of without the help of carrier proteins.
15227	Flaglum-moves cellCillia- help cell stick to surfaces
15228	reproductionresprationnucleus
15229	cells use severa;l diffrent processes some examples are how the cells use the nucleus to manuver and plan the movements that allow the substances to travel across the cell wall. some of the cells use their ribosomes to manuverthem. then they could also use their endoplasmic reticulum or their ER to make this process possible. this is only a few posible ways that cells could control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.

15239	Division: the cells move upon division as well as reproducing.Entering: the cell membrane allows certain things to go in and come out, then they'll move on to the next thing.Lock-and-Key: the cell allows a ligant to connect and bring glucose in the cell.
15240	the three processes used by the cells to control the movement are through protein chemicals, lysomes throughout hte cell and through the blood.
15241	osmois: which is the movement of water through a cell membranediffusion: the brackage of tissues along the cel membranehomostatis: which is the internal balance
15242	The cell membrane uses diffusion and osmosis
15243	1. OSMOSIS- THE MOVEMENT OF WATER IN AND OUT OF CELLS2. DIFUSSION- THE MOVEMENT OF PARTICLES ON AND OUT OF CELLS3. THOUGH PROTEINS
15244	the three things used by cells are cellular resperation
15245	1. Free pass or moving freely through the membrane2. Diffusion or the movement of water from high pressure area to low pressure are through the membreane.3. Proteins or the movement of proteins through special small tubes in a cell's membrane.
15246	DIFFUSION EVENS OUT SUBSTANCES SO THEY REACH EQUILIBRUM, WHICH IS WHEN THEY ARE EVENLY SPREAD THROUGHOUT A SPACE.OSMOSIS IS THE DIFFUSION OF WATER.THE CELL MEMBRANE IS CONSTRUCTED SO THAT CERTIAN SUBSTANCES CAN FIT IN THROUGH IT AND OTHERS CANT.
15247	They control the movement by telling things where to go.
15248	one is there protein that helps it movetwo is all the cells inside of itthree is all the things inside it
15249	The cell membrane has 3 processes that it has.1.) It protects the cell 2.) It moves the cell in any way.3.) It can bring food in or out.
15250	The genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus. When they are switched to MRNA also known as messenger rna that sends a message to the organelles stating that the genetic code needs a specific substance. The third process  is TRNA or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle. The whole process then repeats itself.
15251	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

15253	it is that if one can do with out it will not go no were .if the movement of the substance it will move all around the world. if you
15254	cells use endocytosis, exocytosis and osmosis to move between membranes     In endocytosis, material is encased and becomes part of a cell. in exocytosis the cell encases things inside of itself and sends them out.in osmosis, water is difused and material travels through the membrane
15255	Facilitated Diffusion- allows only certain molecules through membrane and is not going against concentration gradient.Osmosis- the diffusion of water across a membrane.Protein channels- integral and peripheral proteins carry substances into and through membrane into the cell.
15256	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of subtances across the cell membrane are enzymes can move them.
15257	Osmosis is the moving of water across the membrane.Endocytosis is things happening in the cell.Exocytosis is things happening outside the cell
15258	Gel in the cells can help transport substances around the cell membrane.
15259	They have the whip- like structure.cells to control the movement and to gather the food. gather up and move as a team to protect each other.
15260	cell membrane allows certain materials to move around the cells
15261	osmosis, active transport, and passive transport.  active transport moves substancces freely across the cell membrane, osmosis is where plants slowly absorb substnces and passive transport moves substances across the cell membrane slowly.
15262	One way of movement is the use of flagellum witch is a long tail like structure the moves behind the cell.The second is cilia witch are like tiny hair like structers that are all over a cell witch give it mo bilty.
15263	Photosynthesis is the process in which an organism collects enegry from sunlight.Homeostasis is the process in which an organism stores and collects enegry.Another process in which an organism produces it's own enegry.
15264	Cells breaking down. feeding the cells. and letting the cells grow.
15265	The three substances that control the movement across the call membrane.The call wall,clorplast,mitochondrion.
15266	osmosisactive transportpassive transport
15267	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.
15268	There are different kinds of processes that cells use, in this case in humans, such as:1. The White Blood Cells control how much blood is lost and  they are in charge of healing the spot were it is cut.2. The Red Blood Cells controll the blood coming from the heart to throughout the body.3. The Brain Cells can control brain functions and how much blood is taken from the heart and aloud into the brain.
15269	The three processes that help a cell control the substance movements over its membrane could be diffusion, the movement of any particles through the membrane, or equilibrium, which is the outer concentration being equal to the one inside, and the process in which the cell produces energy, which is transfered out of the cell.
15270	Celluar respiration.
15271	The cell membrane is a thick-layered 'wall' that can sometimes prevent what goes in and out of the cell.  It also detects what is suppose to get into the cell.
15272	the cell membrane sends out messages to other parts of the body.movement sends vibrations over the cell membrane causing it to function in different ways.
15273	1. The cell membrane blocks cells from moving around.2. A process called cellular respiration.3. A process called cell diffusion.
15274	osmosis diffusion endocytosis- controls what comes into the cell
15275	Active transport, passive transport, and protein channels
15276	The cytoplasm helps to hold all of the organells and helps things to move. the nucleus determines if the substance can enter the cellif the substance can enter the cell, the cytoplasm allows it to enter
15277	the nucleus controls everything,the mitochondria tells wat enters and leaves the cell.
15278	The cells need enzymes to live that help them make tissues then make organells like the heart, lungs, and mussels
15279	THE WAY THE CELL MEMBRANE IS DESIGNEDIT LETS SO MUCH WATER IN IT
15280	Osomises- The balancing of water inside and outside of a cell or necleaus.I don't remember the other two.
15281	Cell mebranes are semi-permeable. They only allow certain things to enter in and out of the membrane.Proteins can be on the mebrane to guide things into the cell through active transport.Diffusion allows items to go from a high concentration area to a low concentration area through the membrane.
15282	acctive transport, diffusion, non-active transport.
15283	Most cells have a cell wall to controll what goes in and out of the cell membrane. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the blood stream. White blood cells fight off diseases.
15284	They can Diffuse and seperate.
15285	Proteins control movementNucleus controls the cellsDNA makes proteins
15286	The cell membrane,
15287	Photosynthesis, Cellular Respiration, and the Phosphorus cycle.
15288	Nuclear Membrane- always allows CO2 and oxygen to enter and exit, but does not allow solid objects through that do not fit through the protein channel.Passive Transport- water travels from greater to lesser with no energy being used (Osmosis)Active Transport- water travels from lesser to greater by the use of the cell's enegy
15289	Transportatin, When protien is giving infomation to other cellinfomation when a cell is told to do somthing.the cell does it.
15290	if the object is small enough it can fit right through the cell membrane, but if it is a larger object then it has to wait to go through the holes that open and close.
15291	Cells conrol movement by useing flagellen and enzymes to encounter the product of movement.
15292	Osmossis is the diffusion of water. Diffussion is moving objects through the membrane.
15293	Active transport-Movement of molecules from an area of hugh concentration to an area of low concentration.Passive transport is two process in one. It used simple diffusion and filacated diffusion.
15294	1.) osmosis- is the emovement of water throught the cell membrane2.) diffusion- is when more water ends up on one side of the cell membrane3.)osteoporosis
15295	1.resperation is one way it takes substances across the cell2. food gathering also is another way when it gathers the food3. cell selection is another way they select what they want
15296	The cell nucleus controls what goes in to the cell and comes out of it.
15297	The nucleus holds all the nutrients.
15298	Active transport uses energy and goes against the gradient. Diffusion moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area. Osmosis also moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area.
15299	1.it controls the blood going through your veins2.it filters the waist products3.it helps the blood count?
15300	PASSIVE: passive movement is where an organism or substance can get through the membrane.ACTIVE: active movement is where the thing has to go through the channel protein to enter the cell.Osmosis: water can pass easily through the membrane.
15301	MOVES SLOW BECASE OF THE ENYZYMS
15302	Cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell. Its like a security guard in the white house. The nucleus reads the information and decides if it should leave or enter the cell. The cell wall protects what enters and leaves the cell also.
15303	The three processes used by cells are they
15304	They would have a moving processes.
15305	Mutation, Diversity, and Homeostastis
15306	Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.
15307	photosynthesisosmosiswater diffusion
15308	tRNAmitochondria
15309	reproduction
15310	THE CELL MEMBRANE IS THE REPRODUCION BECAUSE THIS CELL ES MOVEMEN
15311	Passive transport moves substances without assistance across a membrane it goes from high concentration to lower ones. Active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient. Vesicles are 'pouches' that the cell uses to transport large particles it suronds the object and pinches it off.
15312	Active Transport-Transport that uses energy in transporting objests across the membrane.Diffusion-Diffusion of objects across a permeable membrane.Osmosis-Movment of water across a membrane.
15313	One process used by the cell to control movement accross the cell membrane is through energy. The cell uses its energy to control the movement across its membrane. Another way is by endocytosis. Endocytosis helps bring things into the cell. Lastly, there is exocytosis. Exocytosis is when things are being removed from the cell.
15314	One process would be cell growth and metabolism , because to move you need to have the right metabolism so you have the energy to even move in the first place.     A second process could be protein synthesis , because you obviously need all the protein you can get to keep you moving throughout the days of hard work.      A third process is the creation of cells , this is a big part of cell movement. You cant just have one cell and expect it to do everything like move, create energy,etc.
15315	Osmosis- Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Cellular respiration- Diffusion of oygen in the cell.
15316	The cell membrance have immune system to know what is coming in to your body, the atttact force that the immune system let out, and how we do thing to our body.
15317	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are when the cell membrane uses proteins to allow substances through the membrane, when small particles enter through the cell membrane, and when particles too large to enter the membrane through proteins use enzymes to make the particles smaller.
15318	DiffusionOsmosisTransfusion
15319	Endocytosis controls what is brought into the cell through the cell membrane.Exocytosis controls what is put out of the cell through the cell membrane.Soddium potassium pump contols how much sodium is left inside the cell and how much of the extra is put out of the cell. It also decides how much potassium is left outside the cell and how much of it is put inside the cell.
15320	flagellem helps them move, cili help them move, and moving side to side or something like a motion of a snake.
15321	Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.      Type one is passive transport. This occurs when the cell dosen't use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane.     Type two is active transport. This occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane.     Type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you
15322	The three processes include tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA.
15323	The cell membrane is controlloed by the nucleous and it goes through processes called meioses, reproduction
15324	RNA, Vacoules, & proteins.They each move things across the cell.
15325	Cell to cell contact,
15326	DNA  MRNA  TRNA
15327	Facultative diffusion- Particles moving through the protein channels from hig to low concentrationDiffusion- something moving through a cell membrane from high to low concentrationosmosis- water moving through a cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration
15328	passive transport is what lets everything enter and leave the cell, active transport is the movement of the cell, an the nucleus is what controls everything.
15329	The cell has has a cell membrane top control the movement. A cell also contains proteins which determine what does and does not enter the cell. And finally, the nucleus, being the brain of the cell, also controls the movement across the cell membrane.
15330	The cell membrane is around the the cell, to protech it from every viosas from coming in the cell, also gives the cell food to eat.
15331	osmosis
15332	cells have cell walls. they block things from getting in and leaving. they protect them.
15333	One, they could move all around the cell membrane and end up in nucleus.Two, they could pop out of the cell membrane and be left outside of the cell membrane.Three, they could just stay in the cell membrane.
15334	1. Prophase 2. Anaphase3. Metaphase

15339	Osmosis - Diffusion of water through the cell membrane.Active Transport - Cell uses activation energy to surround and engulf the object.Passive Transport - Cell uses no energy and lets the object pass through the cell membrane with a special protein.
15340	First the protien comes up to the opening to pass through. Then it uses passive transport, or transport protiens to open the cell membrane and allow the protien to pass through.
15341	1.  cells is what your body has in it so you can live2.  cells cary anything to where ever it goes3.
15342	telophaseanophase
15343	There are many ways a cell controls the movement if substances across the cell membrane.  One of them would be by only letting things go from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration to maintain homeostasis.  Another way is when a receptor protein is triggered to make a channel move things in or out of the cell. A third thing is when a pump is told by the nueclus to work.
15344	Enzynes break down, Protein builds up, and everything is sent to the nucleous.
15345	CELLS WILL EITHER ALLOW OR REJECT SUBSTANCES INTO THE CELL THROUGH ITS CELL MEMBRANE.  ONCE A SUBSTANCE IS INSIDE OF THE CELL, IT MOVES THROUGH THE CELL.  WHEN IT LEAVES THE CELL, IT LEAVES THROUGH RESPIRATION.
15346	The Cell moves the to another place.The membrane controls where the cells go.
15347	Cells use selective permiability to let things in and out of the cell that are smaller, and cells use transport proteins to move larger objects.
15348	They use diffusion, to bring things in and out of the body. They use fission to move things around in the body.
15349	The cell uses its cell membrane to monitor what goes in and out of a cell.  One processes lets substances enter the cell and one process releases substances from then cell.  They can control the movement through diffusion, which means that particles are spread apart equally inside and outside of the cell. Also the cell uses osmosis, which controls the movement of water.
15350	Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane. Cells can also use diffusion. Active transport requires the cell's energy and exports things out of the membrane.
15351	The cells move by the flow of cells, cells do their certain jobs, and cells protect the membrane.
15352	there are thre different movements for substances in a cell.  one movement of substance is when the cell is swelling and is too full and to move it it uses a method to push the substance to another cell.  another movement is when there is less substance in a cell, causing it to shrink and it uses a method to let substances enter.  when the cell is making substance leave it is pushing against the normal flow making it harder and using  more energy. but bringing more substance in for a cell uses little to no energy at all for a cell.  the third method is when two cells are equlvalent in substance to each other and does not swell or shrink, but stays constant.
15353	The three processes are Prophase, Metaphase, and Anaphase.
15354	ANAPHASE PROPHASETELOPHASE
15355	The cells use the mitochondria to move things across the cell membrane.  They also use thier golgi bodies and endoplasmic reticulum.
15356	one way is when cells go and they start to divid and split a part to make new cells

15360	They have a cell membrane to control what comes in and out.They try to capture food.They remove things they don't need.
15361	anaphase, telophase, prosphase
15362	ITMBLOCKS SUBSTANCES FROM ENTERING OR LEAVING THE CELL MEMBRANE
15363	The cell necluous sends information to the other cells to move the whole organism.
15364	The first process used by cells to control the movement of substances acrossed the cell membrane are Ion Channels. They let only ions pass through the lipid bilayer and move along the cell. The second process that is used are carrier proteins they help carry the proteins acrossed the cell. The third way used is enzymes. They help move the substances across the cell so they can pass through the cell membrane.
15365	Cell wall, it helps keep the substance in the membrane,
15366	Passive transport, active transport, and diffusion.Passive transport is things leaving and entering the cell without using any energy.Active transport is using energy to move things into or out of the cell.Diffusion is when an area of higher concentration moves that substance that it is concentrated in to an area with a lower concentration.
15367	When the something wants to get through, there is a signal sent and then a protein channel will open up and the item will get through.Some of the items that want to get through will be able to just slide through the phophilipids.Others can go through by the other proteins that will open up to let others in.
15368	The cell may send signals to the membrane and it will go. The cell may also have helped by giving it DNA. The cell may have communicated with other cells in the organism.
15369	1. nucleus- is the boss tells the cell what to do2. Vacuole- cleans everything up3. Mitochondria- produces energy4. mitosis- makes new cells5. Meosis- makes new sex cells
15370	one is the ribosomestwo is the microtidsthree is the microtons
15371	Interphase is the biging of the cell cycle where the chromatids duplicate. Anaphase the second is the stage where the nucleus dissapears. Prophase is where the sister chromatids line up in the middle of the cell.
15372	flagellum,osmosis
15373	One process is through the use of cyclins. Another way is through the cytoplasm. Lastly is by use of carrier protiens.
15374	They use passive transport, active transport, and possecive transport.
15375	reproduction,flagella,nucleus
15376	a cell uses diffusion, osmosis ,and active transport to move substances across th e cell wall
15377	Cells have a cell wall, which controls what goes in and out of the cell.
15378	Cell division the movement of cells away from each other .Cell wall where the cell movement takes place and moves across the membrane.Cells use ATP to produce energy for the movement of cells.
15379	Diffusion- liquid slowly spreads solid through liquid until it's spread out evenly (ex. powdered chocolate in chocolate milk)
15380	hyper, hypo, osmosis.
15381	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are DNA movement, respiration, and food gathering.
15382	the membran when it go to the nuclus when the cell needs RNA
15383	Cells have many different substances that need moving across the membrane. One process would be electron transport chain (ETC). The electron transport chain or ETC carries neutrons across the cell membrane. Another process would be active transport. Active transport is used in prokayreotes and eukaryotes. It carries waste out and carries proteins in. One last thing that cells use is diffusion. Diffusion carries everything the cells need across the cell membrane and balances the waste products.
15384	Cell membranes are selectively permeable. This means that the phosphid bilayer, which makes up the membrane, will allow certain substances to enter and leave the cell while keeping other substances at bay.

15391	protein gets to the cell it helps the muscles move
15392	the cell membrane is selectively permiable, and lets some supstances in but not others.  in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell.  Osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell.
15393	The cell is like a fillter on both sides. One side lets water and oxygen in and the other side try to kept jerms ,bactrea and other bad things out.
15394	Osmosis is the difussion from one membrane to another.Active transport is the active use of ATP to transport materials.

15397	They slide because its slippery. Its really cramped in there because every thing is so close. Then they are molded into place and they stay there untill there job is complete.
15398	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are, mRNA, tRNA, and RNA
15399	They use osmosis to go through the cell membrane using water.Cellular respiration feeds the substance through with the help of the mitochondrion. Protien synthesis goes through the membrane after the ribosomes produce them.

15401	osmosis- movement of water through the cell mambranediffusion- materials entering the cell though the membraneexocytosis- releasing of waste though the membrane
15402	Protein Syntheis, Evolution, and evolving.
15403	The cell wall has evolved over time in organisms to control movement of substances both in and out of cells.  This includes not allowing in germs or harmful bacteria, as well as putting them out, and allowing in things needed for cell function.  Also, the lysosome in a cell removes unwanted or dead proteins from a cell.  The cell membrane is a third regulatory structure of the cell, used much like the cell wall.
15404	the three processes used by cells are diffusion, osmosis, and isotonic.osmosis is the movement of water from high to low. othrough a barrier to level the isotonic levels. diffusio is the movement of water from low to high to even out the levels of water
15405	They move wastes through the cell.  They use cytoplasm to move stuff through cells.  They ahve holes in the cell membrane or cell wall to regulate what goes in and out.
15406	The processes that control the movement of a substance across the cell membrane are the movement and the resperation, these help tell what is going on with the cell membrance and what kind of interactions it might come to.
15407	they have movements that help the cell produce enought energy to move.the cells must have an energy source that will allow them to move and have a normal cell growth.while things are going past the cell membrane they have to watch for certain thigs that will allow the mto keep them safe.

15415	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane include the flagella, cell wall, and cytoplasm.     The flagella is a tail like attachment of a cell that allows the cell to move around.         The cell wall protects the cell and allows only specific particles in and out of it.          The cytoplasm is picky, and only allows certain materials to pass through it as well.
15416	Osmosis, Diffusion, and Equilibrium.
15417	1- the cells have to divide so they dont get to big. if they get to big then the process will take longer or not go all the way through2-when the cells go through the process miosis and mitois they make more cells.3- the more cells there are the healthier the membrane is
15418	Flagellum.
15419	-Against the flow movement that takes physical energy to move the substances-With the flow this requires no energy to to move across the surface-
15420	Meiosis/Mitosis- The cell divides into two.Viscosity- Where water flows on the substance.
15421	diffusion-is the movement of somthing froma higher concentration to a lower concentration.osmosis-is the movement of water from higher concentrations to lower concentrations through a membranesodium pottasium pump- the use of energy to transfer sodium and pottasium ions from lower concentrations to higher concentrations.
15422	PHOTOSYNTHESIS, ACTIVE TRANSPORT,
15423	The cell membrane tries to equal up the movement of substances from side to side. First the subtances flow freely through the membrane. Then, when the cell has gotten enough substances the membrane sends substances out of the cell.
15424	CELLS USE THE CELL MEMBRAIN TO MOVE AND SOME CELLS USE THERE FLUGELAM TO SEM AND USE IT TO SWIM
15425	transporting, reproducing, and protecting. They have to transport food all around the cell and different functions. The cells have to reproduce to make more cells to live. The cell wall protects the inside of the cell so nothing gets out.
15426	cell wall-protects by keeping the bad stuff out.
15427	reproduction
15428	They use the cell wall to keep bad things out and good things in.
15429	one way is that they cross thhe cerrebellum to get across.the second way is that it passes through the spine.and idk a third one.
15430	Flagella- helps the cell move. Cilla- which also helps the cell move Slime on the cell wall helps the cell move.
15431	DefenseControl Blood
15432	The cell can use the ion channel to get ions in and out. The cell can also use the sodium potassium pump to move sodium in and potassium out. Then the last thing they can use is an enzyme. The enzymes can cause the bigger ions that can not fit though the ion channel help them move across the cell membrain so they can come in and help the cell function properly.
15433	Selective permiability, it only allows certain things to move in and out of the cell.Homeostasis, it regulates the water balance in the cells so the cell can have an isotonic solution.
15434	The cells verifies the substances first. Second, it opnes the wall to the accepted substance. Once the substance is through, it closes the whole and waits for another substance to come by.
15435	It removes waste through the body. Separates good and bad materials. Lastly it fights against bad things that enter the cells.
15436	they move with flagellas and silla
15437	The cell has certain proteins that match up with certain substances and then lets them into the cell.Diffusion is when the cell lets a higher concentration of water move to a lower concentration of water.Osmosis is when a higher concentration of substances move to a lower concentration of substances.
15438	They use protiens to move substances.
15439	One use would be to remove wastes. Another use would be to recieve proteins or other necessities. Finally, it can be used to keep out harmful substances.
15440	The nucleus controls all the cells functions The membrane controls what goes in and out of the cellThen I guess that the mitochondrian control the food intake.
15441	The golgi body releases substances uneeded and send out of the membrane, The nucleus tells some substances where to go in the cell because that is like the brain of the cell, and also through the mitochondria which is the powerhouse of the cell, it tells some substances how to help the cell.
15442	The cell membrane has a semi premiable membrane that only lets certain things go in and out of the cell.
15443	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is flagella which helps the cell get throught the membrane, the nucleus that is the control center, and the cell wall to protect the cell from any unwanted cells or anything unwanted.

15446	MitosisMiosismRN
15447	The cell membrane has holes in  it for proteins and enzymes to pass through. It also has a gate to keep unwanted molecules out. Certain molecules must become attached to the passage for the molecule to pass through. Also the cellmembrane itself does not allow  molecules to go through it unless they have the right structure for it to go through.They must diffuse across the membrane.

15452	Three process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are
15453	Endocytosis, Exocytosis and Cellular Respiration are the three processs used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.Endocytosis is when the substance moving across the cell membrane is brought into the cell.Exocytosis is when the substance is brought out of the cell.
15454	1. The cell membrane blocks whatever is trying to come in until it knows that it is safe to enter the cell without doing harm.2. It helps block any unwanted subsances from passing into the cell if they got passed the cell wall.3. It can control what leaves the cell, if it is not supposed to leave, then the cell membrane or cell wall will keep it from leaving. If it is supposed to leave, it will let it pass through.
15455	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell inlcudes: carrying proteins to differents parts of the cell, carrying genetic information, and many other jobs and processes as well.
15456	It is the nucleus
15457	Osmosis, which is the process of moving substances using waterActive Transport, which is where the cells move substances across themselves, and Passive Transport, which is where the substances just pass through
15458	osmosis,selectively permeable, and diffussion
15459	The cellular respiration process controls the water flow throughout a cell membrane, the mRNA transports messages throughout the cell, and the tRNA produces proteins.
15460	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances are the cellular tissue. This controls what goes in and out of the cell.  Then, lysosomes that control what waste leaves the cell.  Followed by, ribosomes that make proteins.
15461	Active Transport allows substances to move across the cell membrance from low to high concentration. Active Transport uses energy.Osomis allows substances to move across the cell membrance without using energy. Therefore, moving from a high to low concentration.Diffusion allows substances to move across the cell membrane by diffusing them across the cell.
15462	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the following:1. osmosis2. meiosis3. mitosis
15463	1. DIFFUSION 2.3.
15464	Osmosis, difusion, and phospholipid difusion are three processes by which a substance can move across the cell membrane. Osmosis is the dirusion of a substance through a selectively permeable membrane; usually a substance such as water. difusion is the difusion of other semi-small chemicals or atoms moving across the membrane. Phospholipid difusion is the difusion of larger chemicals or atoms across a membrane with the use of a protien.
15465	Endocytosis- The movement of large amounts of materials into the cell with the use of energy.Exocytosis- The movement of large amounts of materials out of the cell with the use of energy.Materials also move down across the concentration gradient from high density to low density without the use of energy in a cell.

15471	Endocytosis-Stuff going into the cellExocytosis-Stuff being excreted from the cellOsmosis-Movement of water through a cell
15472	The first process is possessing a passive transport. This allows certain substances to pass through the membrane without using energy and others are stopped. The second process is osmosis. This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane. The Third process is facilitated diffusion in which energy is used to move molecules across the membrane.
15473	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mRNA rRNA and tRNA.
15474	Water is moved by osmosis.Insulin is moved by fitting into receptors on the cell membrane to make it open, like a lock and key.Any other nutrients are moved by diffusion.
15475	Osmosis- movement by water
15476	Gelate, Genome, Ganglian
15477	Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.  Active transport is also used.  ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.  ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.  Protein carriers also control movement of substances.  Protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell.  All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane.
15478	the cell process controls what enters and leaves tthe cell membrane. it helps control the movement and helpoi t function better
15479	1.Osmosis lets certain things pass through water.2. Diffusion pushes things out of the cell.3. Also by being selectively permeable and only letting certain things enter the cell.
15480	Facilitated diffusion- is a way that substances move from one form of concentration to another form of consintration, diffusion- it takes substances from an area of high concentration to low consintraion, osmosis- deals with the water bieng moved
15481	Well the cell have to move though the membrane to the chain of reaction.
15482	The cells divide. 23 chromosomes for a male and 46 chromosomes for a female. Mitosis and meiosis take place in the function of a cell. And enzymes help proteins to be made. Diploid is all 46 chromosomes. Haploid is half and that is only 23.
15483	miosis, mitosis, and interphase
15484	Interphase, Anaphase, Telophase
15485	The concentration gradient moves things throught the cell pushing them although exocytosis uses its own energy to push things, such as waste, out of the cell.
15486	Osmosis- The diffusion of materials through water particlesActive transport- Moves materials by using energyPassive transport- Moves materials without using energy
15487	Transcription.
15488	Cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane. A cell's membrane is selectively permeable. Cells also use passive and active transport. Passive transport requires no energy. Some form of passive transport include osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion. Active transport, unike passive, reguires energy to move things through the cell membrane.
15489	CELLS USE THE ORGANELLES TO HELP MOVE THINGS. THEY OFTEN HAVE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO MOVE THINGS. THEY ALSO USE THE SMOOTH AND ROUGH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM.

15501	Active transport:  It is used by the cell membrane to transfer items throughout the cells.  The cell membrane decides if the items can pass through the cell or not.  Distribution: The cell membrane will also use distribution to decide what items go to each part of the cell and how much will be sent to the organelles.  These items could be things like water or other fluids.Seperation: The cell membrane can decide at any time what to seperate in a cell or out of the cell.  It can split up ribosomes or keep fluids from entering the cell.  The cell membrane is the main protector of the cell.

15621	one of the processes is by
15622	In cells, their plasma mebrain, also know as the cell membrain, is used for most of tbe cells function. The plasma membrain aids in how the cell moves. Also, the plasma membrain also controlls how cells take in food, and how the excrete waist. The plasma membrain, also helps keep the cell its shape.
15623	cilia- moves cellcytoplasm-keeps the organelles in cellflagellum-moves cell
15624	metaphase,prophase,anaphase
15625	Diffusion is used by cells to allow substances to enter the cell
15626	Cells use organelles to move things around it. there are 2 of things that can be used to move it throughout the cell. they are the smooth and rough Endoplasmic Reticulims
15627	Active transport-requires energyPassive transport- requires no energyosmosis- the movement of water from one place to another
15628	One process would be mitosis and another would be meiosis.  A diffrent process would be respiration.
15629	The three types of movements are diversion, equilibrium, and distrubition. Diversion is the process of one substance passing through the membrane. Equilibrium is the process of balancing the concentration on both sides of the membrane. Distribution is the process of moving two different substances to opposite sides of the membrane.
15630	Cell WallRibosomesFlagellum
15631	defustion lets things in and out of the membrane. Osmois lets water in and out of the membrane.
15632	meiosis and mitosis. they control what the cell does and where it goes.
15633	Chemical reactionmitosis- reproduction of cellmiosis
15634	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of sunbstances across the cell membrane are mRNA, tRNA, and RNA
15635	1.  The cell can use transport proteins, which are always open to any and all sbstances that fit.2.  The cell can use a recognition protein with a carbohydrate chain on it to keep viruses and other harmful stuff from getting inside of the cell.3.  The cell can use receptor proteins that only allow substances that fit in the exact shape, (etc...), inside the cell... these do not allow harmful things inside of the cell.
15636	One way is by osmosis. Osmosis is when cells transport water across the cell membrane. Another way is protien channels. The channels transport big objects across the membrane.
15637	the cell membrane sends the a message to another part of the cell membrane. then it sends the substances threw tubes.
15638	the three processes would be reproduction,respiration,and food gathering.
15639	diffusion, exocysitosis, and endocitosis. Exocysotosis moves things out of the cell and endocytosis moves things into the cell. Diffusion moves water into and out of the membrane.
15640	cells use diffusion to move liquids from one area to another. cells use a selective permeable membrane to allow certain materials to leave and enter the cell.
15641	cell membrane cell wall and cytoplasm
15642	Diffusion is the process in which something moves from a part of low concentration to Higher Concentration or High to low.Binary fission is the process of moveing something across a permeable membrane.Osmosis is moving water across a semi-permeable membrane.
15643	glycolosis, krebs cycle,electron transport chain
15644	1. the smooth ER-transfors stuff to the nucles2. the rough ER-takes stuff from yhe nucles3. the golgie-makes ribosomes
15645	Cells use their cell walls to stop harmful substances. They also use their flagellum to control the movement across the cell membrane.
15646	osmosis, diffusion, mitosis
15647	1) Cells have cytoplasm in order for them to be able to move throughout the cell.2) The nucleus controls what happens in the cell.3) The endoplasmic reticulum takes things out of the nucleus.
15648	One form of getting around ould be using a flagellum or tail like structure that enables the cell to move around. Another form is cilla or small tiny hairlike structures that are on the outside of the cell that help the cell move around my grabbing onto things and puling it's slef. Amother way is like in your body, you heart pumps the bood through your blood stream with out any of the stuuctures like a flagellum or cilla. Enabling it to move around.

15651	The cell membrane does not allow all things in the cell.The cytoplasm slows the movement of things through the cell.Liquids pass through the membrane easily.
15652	Nutrients give off energy. Protein give strength. Movement helps it to move.
15653	TranscriptionMiosisMitosis
15654	three processes used by cells to move substances across the cell mambrane are:1) Active Transport2)3)Difussion
15655	It has molecules that glide across the inside to watch out for bad things and to put things that cross over out that shouldnt get in. The cell aslo has molecules that protect itself from bad things.
15656	The cell can suck food in, can spit it out, and can hold it in place with the membrane.
15657	it controls the movement by
15658	There are three types of ways that cells move substances across the concentration gradient. There is a type of diffusions where cells have holes in them that allow things to pass through there membrane. There is a type of diffusion where a cell moves around and engulfs things and there is a type of diffusion where the cells have both holes and they engulf things.
15659	endocytocis, exocytocis, ion channels
15660	cell membrane, protein, and feniues
15661	endocytosis is particles going into the cellexocytosis ss particles going out of the cellosmosis is water moving in and out of the cellpenocytosis is small and liquid particles going into the cellphagocytosis is large particles going into the cell
15662	Passif of transport.
15663	Meiosis and Miosis is the passing of materials through membranes in a cell.The digestive track allows for materials to be released at certain points of time to allow no back up
15664	The 3 processes cells use to controll movement would be, the physoplic biolayer which knows what goes in and out of the cell, then phosphates send the message about the movement and then the orgenelles inside move from one place to another.
15665	The cell membrane only allows certain materials intop the cell, by guarding the wall.
15666	1. Photosynthesis     2. Cell Respiration     3. Mitosis
15667	Endocytosis (which is part of active transport), where the cell uses energy to pull items through the selectively permeable membrane.Exocytosis (part of active transport), the cell uses energy to push items out of the cell.Diffusion (part of passive transport), the cell does not use energy to gain the items it wants but lets the items move through the selectively permeable membrane.
15668	The cell movements are:
15669	prokaryotes, ukaroyotes, ribosomes
15670	THEY MOVE IN LITLE GORPS AND EAT BATREA AND CAN REPORDUCE ASEXUALLY
15671	The cell membrane is a jelly like substance.
15672	Meiosis, Mitosis, and Oserosis
15673	The cell membrane keeps in nutrients and things that are vital for the cell to live.  It also pushes stuff out, such as waste, that is not necessary or could be harmful to the cell.  Lastly, the cell membrane acts as a protector to protect the cell from anything that could possibly harm or damage it.
15674	One process is active transport, which is transport with the aid of transport proteins. Transport proteins help to get the substances to move through the plasma membrane. Another process is passive transport, which is not very differet from active transport, except this transport does not use the aid of transport proteins. The substances move without them.A third process is exocytosis or endocytosis.Exocytosis is the secreting or expelling of unwanted materials or wastes.Endocytosis is the surrounding and engulfing of materials.

15678	The cell wall processes the movement in and out of the cell.
15679	The substance go through the membrane,
15680	Different parts of the cell control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  The nucleus carries out genetic information such as DNA to the rest of the cell.  The mitochondrian transport energy throughout the cell.  The cytoplasm allows this movement to take place throughout the cell as well.
15681	Cells are the basic unit of all living things. Cells have numerous functions such as fighting off infections when they enter out body. They also transport information all over our body. They let the rest of our bodies know what they're suppose to do. Cells also keep us living and breathing.
15682	they use movement.
15683	Cells carry information to other cells. Cells push out unwanted or unnecessary materials from the body.Cells created other cells.
15684	Everything that leavess or enters the cell goes through pore membranes.Photosynthesis helps give nutrients to plants by absorbing light and carbon dioxide and makes sugar for the plant.
15685	Diffusion, allows the flow to be controled. Osmosis lets water in while the surface area decreases.
15686	the cell membrain only let certain stuff in to the nucleus.

15692	Cells use diffusion to get materials through the cell membrane. They also use osmosis to get water in and out of the cell. Some also use facilitated diffusion which uses energy to move things.
15693	Cell DivitionCell ReproductionCell Movement
15694	There are certain cell organelles that controll what goes in and out of the cell. Also substances are moved in and out of the cell by diffusion. Another way is cells are able to controll how much of sometimes goes in or out of the cell
15695	Cells are the primary block in life and are responsible for for the many complex things that we do . Cells make tissue that make organs that make organ systems .
15696	Diffusion, meioses.
15697	They use Flagelates, pseudopods, or cilia.
15698	Cells have a cell membrane that controls the movement of substances that come in and out of the cell. Also, the surface area plays a roll in controlling the movement of substances aswell. Along with the cell membrane and the surface around, the volume of the cell also has a part in controlling the movement of substances. If the surface area of a cell is bigger than the volume of a cell, it will make it difficult for things to move across the cell. It is the same as if the volume is larger than the surface area.
15699	prophase, anaphase, telophase
15700	There is a process called osmosis to move substances in and out of cells. Cells also have proteins that move substances around the membrane. Lastly, cells use channel proteins, which channel energy.

15706	meiosis mitosis
15707	They move the cells.They keep them were the need to be.
15708	One process the cell uses to move substances across the membrane, is through the nucleus. The Nucleus of a cell contains genetic material called DNA which tells the cell which processes to do, this process includes movement across the cell.  Secondly, The cell membrane in general is a regulator of what can and cannot enter and exit the cell.  Last of all, in the process of transfering DNA to other parts of the cell, mRNA moves across the cell to ribosomes, in order for the DNA to be processed and used for a specific cause. This example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane.
15709	The cytoplasm helps regulate what comes in and outThe cell wall controls what leaves and comes inRibosomes carry proteins throughout the cell
15710	The cell membrane desides what can go into the cell and what can't.
15711	Osmosis, diffusion, and Equilibrium.
15712	the nucleus tells where each individual needs to go.
15713	Cells can use osmosis which is the diffusion of water across a cell membrane.Cells can use facilitated diffusion which is the movement of particales across a membrane.Cells can use passive or active transport. Active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein, this uses energy.  Passive transport does not use channel proteins, nor does it use energy.
15714	They use one process where it just glides across the cell.One process is used to carry it over.And one process is used to slide it across the cell. Transcription Translation and Transversion
15715	The cellular membrane stops unwanted materials from getting into the cell. The nucleus decides what it wants inside of the cell.The cytoplasm slows untwanted materials so they can be killed.

15718	The tree processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are Blood flow going to the cells, Oxygen flow, and nutrients flow.
15719	One process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is moving water across a membrane. There is hypertonic osmosis, which is moving water out, hypotonic, which is moving water in, and isotonic which is equal water moving in and out. Another process is using a protein channel. The protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids. Another process if diffusion, which is moving particles from high concentration to low concentration.

15723	DifutionActive transportelectron transport
15724	Cells use chloroplasts to absorb nutrients and it is used as an organizer for transporting substances through out the cell. Cells also use the mitochondria to move substances. The mitochondria is like the cells organizer, it balances out the substances and sends them where they need to go.
15725	One way the cell controls the movement across the membrane is by knowing where to go. Aniother way is by swimming to where it needs to go, and the last way i moves is by just moving there.
15726	Cells can use the process of osmosis which has water pass through its barrier. A second process is diffusion. Lastly, a third process is facilitated diffusion.

15736	They use translation, transcription, and replication.
15737	When a substance tries to move into a cell, the cell mebrane is selective in what it alows. The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning it only allows what it wants into and out of the cell. Also, substances try to connect with different protiens on the cell membrane. If they are not the right substances and protiens, they will not be allowed through the barrier.
15738	Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell. Active transport is when energy is used to move the substances across the cell membrane.Passive transport is when energy is not used to move the substances across the cell membrane.

15741	The three processes that are used by the cells to move across the cell membrane are diffustion, osmosis, and active transport.
15742	The three processes that the cell uses to conrol the movement across the cells are the movement of the lipid, nuclies, and another process.
15743	cytoplasm is used to move particles throughout the cell.the flagella is used like a tail on a cell for movement.and the cillia are little hairs used for movement in the cell to move particles across the cell membrane.
15744	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are osmosis, facilitated diffusion and active transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane. Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of a large molecule across a semi-permiable membrane that requires help, such as transport protiens. Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy.
15745	Flagella are used for movement by the cell. Cellular Respiration is a processed used by the cell to breathe. Mitosis is another process used by the cell to reproduce.
15746	nucleuscell membrane
15747	The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.  It lets oblects in or out of the cell.  Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.

15759	-Some cells have membrane bound organelles that seperate the different types of organelles.-
15760	Diffusion     Substances like nutrients can move across the cell membrane through diffusion which allows them through little pores.Osmosis     Substances, mainly water, moves through the cell through Osmosis through little pores also.Active Transport     Active Transport allows larger substances to move through the cell membrane when they can't pass through the pores. In active transport, Energy helps move substances through the actual membrane.
15761	Active transport is when the movement is used with the need of energy.Pasive transport is when the movement is used without energy.The sodium potassium pump is a type of movement that requires energy.
15762	Osmosis is when water moves across the membrane.Active transport is when energy is needed to move the substance across the membrane.Passive transport is when no energy is needed.For bigger particals, a protein is used.The cell can also surround a partical and absorbe it. It is the oppisite for removing a partical.
15763	the cell membrane, mitochondria, and ribosomes.
15764	Telephase, which separates the two membranes.Anaphase, and Interphase
15765	To cross the cell membrane, proteins help molecules across. Lypid heads on the outer layer and on the inner layer help to secure the cell membrane. Phosphate heads help to secure the membrane as well, to make sure nothing comes out or in that isn't suppose to.
15766	A concentration gradient is the movement from a bound structure into another, so therefor this would be one way cells control movement. Another way is organelles. Organelles all have different purposes of being in the cell, some may perform the task on controling what comes in and out of a cell. Another way is the Lysosomes because they are the 'digesters' in the cell so this would export substances that are not needed.
15767	Tails for movement such as: flagella (propel them) slimy like substances that help glide, and also thin shaped tails that help frequent movement.
15768	They use their bodys, tails, and the use their surrounds to help them.
15769	The cell membrane has several ways to let things in and out of the cell. The cell membrane is made of up phospate heads and lipid tails. These are next to each other creating a solid block for the cell. Things that let things in and out of the cell are a mitchochondra. These lets things transport in and out of the cell. Some things are so microscopic that they can go through the cell wall and back without being noticed. Some have to be checked for safety by the cell membrane to make sure everything inside of the cell is save. Even though these methods are used some things are very small and can fit through the cell membrane and go into the cell without even  being noticed, this is where different things come in and help out the cell.

15774	Thre processes are osmosis, diffusion and  and absorbtion. They are all brought accross the cell membrane and into the cell. Osmosis is when the cell balances what is outside the cell with what is inside the cell. Diffusion is where substances move outside of the cell, and Absorbtion is where a cell has substance enter inside of it.

15784	1. The 'password' or the 'handshake method' this shows what can come in and what can't come in during the cell cycle process.2. The cell membrane is what seperates the good and the bad so anything trying to enter through the cell wall is what is meant to be kept out. 3. When something tries to get into the cell membrane the cells regulate the flow of all substances keeping anything that has to stay out, out.
15785	Cells make protein channels that allow certain things to move across  the cell membrane. They allow substances to move in and out of the cell. They also have the cytoplasm which can control how things move around the inside of the cell. Lastly, things diffuse in the cell where particles come in and out because there is low concertration in one area and that is where they want to move so it isn't as crowded. This causes thing to constantly move across the cell.
15786	Ther are many differnet types of cells. Nerve cells it can tell when you are nervous and you could be nervous about something else. Brian cells you have them to think things through and you need them.
15787	The substances will first be checked and sorted according to bad and good. Then the cell membrane will allow it to pass through and will seperate from there. By then the substances will be put to work to form more cell membranes.
15788	#NAME?
15789	Homeostasis is created by water soluable substances passing through the nucleuses of the cells. It also helps with controlling the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Another step used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is permeable selection. Permeable selection allows the cell to control and decide what it wants to pass through the cell mebrane.

15814	Cells use osmosis, active transport, and passive transport. osmosis moves water through the cell membrane by having to much pressure or to little pressuure on the cell membrane. Passive transport is that when there is too much pressure on the inside of a cell the substance on the inside of the cell kinda get pushed out of the cell so pressure can be relieved. active transport is when substance move across the membrane into pressure so it requires more energy from the cell to move across the membrane.
15815	Osmosis, Is the movement of water across the membrain. Endocitosis, is the movement of things in to the cell. Exocitosis, is the movement of things out of the cell.

15817	Cells have endocytosis. Endocytosis is where the large compounds come into the cell throught the membrane.Cells have passive transport. This is where compounds come through with out using energy.Cells have active transport. This is where compounds come through using energy.
15818	They use diffusion to transport things across a membrane.
15819	Selective permeable membrane allows only what needs to get through to get through.
15820	Diffusion-Osmosis- Makes the water leave or go into the cell.Passive Transport- Where there is more of something inside the cell than there is outside of the cell. Some of the things inside the cell move to the outside to create equilibrium.
15821	Osmosis,The movement of water across of a cell.DIFFUSION,The seperating of cells.
15822	DIFFUSION, OSMOSIS,ABSORPSTION
15823	Active transport uses energy. It moves from areas of lesser concentration to areas of greater concentration.Passive transport does not use energy, such as osmosis, it simply moves to areas of greater concentration to areas of lesser concentration.Oxygen and other substances are absorbed through the cell membrane.
15824	The cell has cytoplasm so everything in the cell can be held together.  It also goes through meisis to keep everything balanced inside. It also has the cell wall so nothing can get in and disturb the inside workings of the cell.

15826	There is lots of fluid in the cell so substances can float about. Ribosomes tranfer substances across the membrane in the cell. Mitochandria carry substances around the cell.
15827	cytoplasm- the jelly like substancemitocrondira- the enegry ER-highway for cells
15828	Materials move into the cell through Passive transport, active transport, diffusion, and ossmosis. Passive transport doesn't require the cell to exert energy, but active transport does. Difusion is simply the movement of substances into and out of the cell. Ossmosis involves diffusion by use of water.
15829	A cell uses mRNA to move genetic information throughout the cell. A cell also uses tRNA to transfer information to a different part of the cell. Finally, a cell uses ribosomes to move information across the cell.
15830	reproduction is making 2 of itself, cloning which is making and identical of itself, prophase
15831	they used water,oygen,and movement.
15832	One of the three processes that a cell uses is osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane. Another process a cell uses is phagocytosis. phagocytosis is when the cell surrounds and engulfs the substance. Another process is endocytosis. Endocytosis is the process where the cell moves the substance across the cell membrane.
15833	diffusion- moves water to the cell membrane
15834	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are. * The golgi bodies  * lysosomes * protozoas
15835	1.Golgi apperates2.ATP3.proten
15836	One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis. Where cells 'unconciously' transfer water in and out of their cell wall.  Another process is mitosis.
15837	Equillibrium, which is when they move across the membrane until both sides are balanced. Diffusion, which is when the substances diffuse across the membrane either into or out of the cell membrane. And when bacteria or another harmful substance tries to get into the cell, the cell membrane doesn't let them through. They do everthing they can to protect the nucleus.
15838	mRNAtRNARNA
15839	Puncutated equilibrium controls the movement by keeping everything in the middle of the cell and allowing nutrients to come in.
15840	Diffusion is used to flush substances in and out of the cell.  Osmosis is used to flush fluids in and out of the cell.  Exokenesis is used to rid the cell of larger particles.
15841	One of the three processes is diffusion.Another one of the processes is facilitated diffusion.The final one is osmosis.In diffusion particles move through th holes in the cell membrane.In facilitated diffusion an organelle helps particles that are to large to fit through the holes get in or out.In osmosis the cell membrane forms a bubble around the particle and either pulls it in or pushes it out.
15842	Three types of movement a cell may use to get substances across the cell membrane are; facilitated diffusion in which channels help substances get across the membrane, some cells use their psuedopods to absorb substances, and others use diffusion in which the substance goes from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure.
15843	cytoplasm- plasma throughout the cell which organelles can move. lysosomes- carry proteins from mitochondria to nuclues
15844	Cell wall stops things from entering.  Things that are too large cannot enter the cell.
15845	Osmosis is the movement of water out of the cell membrane. Diffusion is the movement of substances into the cell through the cell membrane. Some cells have special vacuole sacs that are released out through the cell membrane. The sacs contain the cell's waste in it.
15846	First they go through miosis and do it that waySecond they go through mitosis and do it that wayThird they build a cell wall to protect it
15847	The first on is the passive transport which it moves items without and energy at all. The second one is the active transport which moves items by energy. The last on is diffusional fusion which randomly moves items.
15848	Diffusion Active Transport
15849	The flagealla is the taillike structure, which is used for movement. The body of the cell is to recongnize where the cell is going. The head of the cell is for the infectios part or helping part where it injects a virus or a anti virus to help the body.
15850	One step to moving substances across the cell membrane is using the mitochrondria. Another step to moving substances across the cell membrane is by using Lysosomes.The third step I would use is the Golgi Apparatus.
15851	The cell membrane opes to let the substance into the cell.
15852	Diffusion- movement from a high concentration to lowOsmosis- a movement across a semi-permeable membraneTransfusion- movement from low concentration to high
15853	cell memberain which controls the cellcytoskelon which gives the cell its shapethe cell its self which help all living to live
15854	The cell wall lets fluids and other object come through the cell. The cell membrane also lets other objects and fluid that haven't been filtered into it. The cell also absorbs fluid and other material into it.
15855	Selective permiability, protiens, increased boarder control.
15856	Semi-permiable membrane only allows substances to move across the membrane by passive and active transportation.  These let things like water go across the membrane.  With active and passive transportation the solutes will diffuse in and out of the cell to maintain their balance.  With passive transportation it does not use any energy for water to go exit and enter the cell through the processes of osmosis and diffusion.  With active transportation the water uses exocitosis and endocytosis.  All of these processes help balance out the cell and its environment to maintain homeostasis.
15857	interphasemitosis.G phase.
15858	1. Translation- involves mRNA and tRNA2. Transcription- invovles mRNA and tRNA3. Movition- involves moving
15859	Simi permeable membrain, mitosis, and cell transport.
15860	Cells control the movement of substances by decreasing the leves of protiens.They also control it by reducing the leves of oxygen.Another thing is that it will let only a few almounts of subatences to the cell mambrane.
15861	they filter them threw where they want them at
15862	Osmosis (The movement of water through the membrane), Active transport (Transport that uses ACP to move larger particles through the membrane), and Passive transport (Transport that doesn't use ACP and lets the smaller particles just slide through.)
15863	1 process is hypotonic, which allows water to come into the cell. Another process is hypertonic, which is when water goes out of the cell. One other process is isotonic, which is when there is an equal amount of water on the inside and outside of a cell.
15864	One way the cells control movment across the cell membrane are with simple diffusion.  another way they move around is by assisted diffusion.  the last way is by an opening in the membrane.
15865	Diffusion, fission, permeable membrane can occur in the cell.
15866	Phosplipid bilayer.Golgi apporatous.
15867	Active transport is where the cell uses energy to pass objects across the membrane, passive transport is where there is no energy required to pass objects across the membrane, and osmosis is when water difuses across the membrane.
15868	DIFFUSION
15869	They are Mitosis and Meiosis.
15870	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the nuclues, cell membrane, and nucleotide.
15871	1.the vacolue move protien from the golgi aperatus2.the lysosome moves around the cell cleaning up old proteins and lipids3.the golgi aperatus catches proteins
15872	flow movement tail movementhow fast they move
15873	Cells use messengers to send information to and from the cell membrane.Cells have the cell wall to surround and protect the cell membrane.Cells have the nucleus in the center of the cell to move everything smoothly, like the heart in our bodies
15874	the nucleus tells everything where to gothere are specific organisms that help other organism move
15875	The cells have water inside the membrane to help with movement.
15876	Three processed used by cells to controll the movement of substances across the cell membrance are;
15877	medaphase where the chromosomes line up in the middle, interphase where the chromosomes are pulled apart, and telophase where the cell splits.
15878	Diffusion and osmosis are teo of the processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Diffusion is when the cell moves substances in or out of the cell membrane.  Osmosis is the movement of water in or out of the membrane.
15879	Percolation, allowing water in and out of the cell membrane through pours. Receptor proteins recieve certain proteins and transer them through the cell membrane. Transport proteins are basically open tubes that anything can get through, harmful or helpful.
15880	t RNA , m RNA , r RNA
15881	They use marker proteins to control what goes in and out.
15882	prophase,anaphase,telophase
15883	Cells control what comes in and out. Cells can carry things across the cell membrane. Cells control what can go across the cell membrane.
15884	Well the cell membrane only lets some things into the cell. They have these protien chanalas and they also have these active sites that let things in and out of the cell.
15885	The cell can use osmosis to help regulate the amount of water going in and out of the cell. Next the cell can send foreign substances out of the cell, such as bacteria. Then there are some parts of the membrane where certain things will only fit, such as food.
15886	3 process used by cells to control the movement of cells are;      1. They use parts of the body     2. They fly really fast     3. They're like superman
15887	Endocytosis - moving into a cell Exocytosis - moving out of a cell Diffusion - using wtaer to transer
15888	The cell membrane is used to control what enters and leaves the cell.The cell wall is used to keep things out of the cell that aren't supposed to be in there.The nucleus controls the whole cell and it sends signals to the cell wall or membrane to keep things out.
15889	One way is that the cell uses movement is it uses its flagellum
15890	Cells use transport proteins to move substances acrosss the plasma membrane. the substance moves through the protein and the plasma membrane.     Cells use diffusion to let some substances move through the plasma membrane.     Cells use active transport to transport substances through the plasma membrane.
15891	Flagellas use theyre whip-like structure at the ventral side of they're body to manover through the cell.
15892	Substances can enter a cell by going through the phosolipid bilayer, which is made of lipids. If a substance is large, it will go through a channel protein, the channel proteins have receptor cells that allow a certain substance to enter.
15893	To control the movement of the substances the ribosomes. golgi apparatus, and lysosomes control it.
15894	Three processes used by cells to control movement of substances is circulation, the amount, and space. The cells are continualy rotated by the heart pumping blood so they can move things in and out of where they are supposed to be. Second, Red blood cells carry oxygen and some waste out of the body. The cell has to know how much it can handle so it won't implode. Last the space. Cells must control how many there are of them so they will not run out of space to travel. If they run out of space the cells will not be able to carry out its normal functions of carrying out waste, carrying oxygen, or bring in nuturients needed for the body to maintain homeostatsis.
15895	revloution, reproduction...evolution?
15896	Provide food
15897	The cell membrane moves which makes it harder for substances to find their way inside the cell.The cell membrane has many channel proteins located on the outside that make it hard for large substances to fit throughThe cell membrane is a lipid bilayer which means it has two parts the middle is all fatty acids which can and tend to push things away
15898	The cells use anaphase, interphase, prophase, metaphase.
15899	Active transport, Passive transport, and Diffussion are three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
15900	The three processes are osmosis, diffusion, and infusion.
15901	The cell membrane is airtight and doesn't allow anything unauthorized through it. Anything can come out but nothing can go in without its permission.
15902	1.) Diffusion- the movement of a particle across a cell membrane, can be active or passive2.)Osmosis- the movement of water across a cell membrane3.) Facilitated Diffusion- diffusion in which energy in the form of ATP is used to help large particles pass through the membrane
15903	Cells use osmosis which is the transport of liquid across the membrane without using energy. Cells also use diffusion which is the transport of particles across the membrane from the high concentration to a low concentration without using energy. Cells, lastly, use exocytosis and endocytosis which it the movement of large particles acrosse the membrane into the cell for endocytosis and out of the cell for exocytosis. This process uses energy.
15904	1Photosynthesis2Digestion3 I have Know idea ?
15905	One reason is that enzymes let stuff through the membrane.   Ozmosis is a process that lets stuff go throught the membrane.
15906	Endocyotsis, when food enters the cell through the cell membrane, exocytosis, when food exits as waste out of the cell, and translation, when the cell surrounds the food, and engulfs it.
15907	Three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane are then cilla and flagella.
15908	KEEPS CELLS CONSTANT IN MOVEMENTKEEPS THEM BALANCED
15909	Diffusion is the movement of particles, such as carbon dioxide, from an area of higher consentration to an area of lower consentration accross a cell membrane. Diffusion does not require energy. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a simi-permeamble membrane. In Osmosis, particles go from an area of higher consentration to an area of lower consentration. Osmosis does not require energy. Active Transport is the movement of ions and other particles from an area of lower consentration to an area of higher consentration accross a cell membrane. Active Transport requires energy.

15918	1. Osmosis is the transfer of water across a mabrane.2. Active transport is where the cell uses energy to move substances across the membrane.3. Nonactive transport is where the cell does not use energy to move substances across a membrane.
15919	They use the cell membrane to determine who comes in and who goes out.They protect the cell's organelles with the cytoplasm.They surround the substance that wants to come in the cell to determine whether or not it is bad.
15920	They use the endoplasmic reticulum to move food across the cell membrane. They use lysosomes to move wastes across the membrane. They also use golgi apparatis to move energy across the memberane.
15921	Cell wall- that will regulate what comes in and out of the cell and across the cell membrane.Nuclear envelope- regulates what comes in and out of the nucleus wich will limit the movement in the cell membrane.
15922	Three ways a cell controls the movements across the cell membrane are, a cell membrane controls what goes where in the cell, lipids in the cell can let certain things in and other things out, and channels in the cell membrane direct where things are gonna go.
15923	Some cells will use sunlight, sugers, and salt intake to control the movement across a cell membrane.
15924	cell membranenucleussymbiosis
15925	Three processes that control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the protists, the cell nucleus, and the flagillum
15926	Three processes used by cells to control movement across the cell membrane are active transport, cell division, and passive transport.  Active trasnsport is the movement of substances that require energy while passive transport does not require energy. Cell division is the process of a cell dividing into two and distributing the cell to the proper area.
15927	The cells use marker proteins. The cells use channel proteins. The cells use......
15928	Three processes used by cells to control movement is letting it into the cell, going to the nuleus, and then going back out.
15929	it is a portien carryer
15930	1.They use active transport to transport things in and out of the cell useing energy. 2.Passive transport also transports thing in and out of the cell but without useing energy. 3.The membrane also keeps out things that shouldn't go into the cell.
15931	Timpanic Membrane
15932	Lock and Key, only proteins that can fit into the lock are able to get into the cell.They have protector protiens that only allow certain substances in, one of them glycoprotein has a protector like a bouncer that blocks some of substances from entering, and another one receptor protein only lets in ions.and transfer proteins are ones that if they are small enough they can get through. They also have substances inside the cell that fight off the bad substances that come in.
15933	The cell uses a golgi apparatus to ship and move proteins across the cell. Ribosomes carry proteins.The cell uses a endoplasmic reticulum to move the substances throughout the cell.
15934	Prophase, Metaphase, and Anaphase.
15935	Cytoplasm provides a liquid enviornment to make the transportation of substance in and out of the cell easier.Cell membrane- has small holes in it like pores, that limits different substances from entering the cell,Nucleus controls the instructions for each part of the cell...So it gives the cell membrane basic instructions for what may come in and go out of the cell.
15936	One process that the cell membrane does is mitoisis. This is when the cell starts to make a copy of itself. Another is when miosis, this is when the cells nucleus parts into 2 and starts to divide. the final one is cell division, this is when the cell divides and now there are 2 cells.
15937	1.) Cells use fiber like hairs to touch the substances and pass them along.2.) Substances can pass straight through them to get to an organ.3.) Substances can combine to the outer membrane of a cell.
15938	Osmosis ,water on the surface continues to move into and out of the cell at a stable rate.Exocytosis, things from inside the cell exit the cell through the cell membrane.Endocytosis, things from outside of the cell move into the cell through the cell membrane.
15939	figila a whip like structure. cilia and virgialina
15940	Endocytosis is a process where things are engulfed and brung into the cell. Exocytosis is a prossed where things are taked out of the cell. Active movement moved things around the cell using energy.
15941	The plasma membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell, the cell wall surrounds the cell and the ER controls what goes on in the cell.
15942	They use active transport to control the intake and outake of water and sugars.
15943	Cells have many different parts that help them control substances across the cell membrane like Transport proteins decide what goes in,
15944	The cells use energy and they also use active transport.
15945	Diffusion, Osmosis, and absorption
15946	Cytoplasm helps slow the movement.
15947	prophase, anaphase, and telophase
15948	anaphase- where the cells are joinedTelophase-where the 2 sister cells joinProphase-where the cells slit apart
15949	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are:  diffusion, equillibrium, and transfusion.Diffusion is the net movement of particles across the membrane.  Equillibrium is when the cell is in equal in all parts.  Transfusion is when everything is moving across the cell.
15950	1.Cells contain the nucelus which controls how the cell functions. 2.Controls have the cell moves.                                                3.Conrtols how the cell gets food.

15952	Facilitated diffusion is a process used to get materials inside of the cell.
15953	1) transit RNA and DNA. 2) reactants3) cells protein
15954	The golgi body helps move substances across the cell membrane along with the endoplasmic retuclum, and the proteins.
15955	1. tRNA transports RNA strands across the cell to help it get to the DNA strands.2. Golgi apparatus sorts and stransports proteins for the cells use.3. Other organelles
15956	Cells use osmosis to carry water from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane.Cells use diffusion to carry materials such as carbon dioxide from a high concentration to a low concentration.Cells use facilitated diffusion to carry bigger materials such as glucose across the cell membrane.
15957	The cell membrane controls the movement of matter in and out of the nucleus through:Active transport- there is less matter outside of the cell and more is added.Passive transport- there is less matter inside the cell and more is added.Equilibrium-where the inside of the cell and the inside are equal.
15958	Osmosis, Diffusion, and Moiesis
15959	There are three main types of movement but I personly dont know them.
15960	Of these three processes, one is using pores on the membrane itself to transfer proteins and other things. Another way cells move substances throught its membrane is osmosis, by how some items can simply pass through the membrane without using the pores, such as water.
15961	POLAR , NONPOLAR TAILS, TRANSPORT PROTEINNONPOLAR TAILS REPEL WATER
15962	1. they use the blood system.2. mRNA3.
15963	The cell membrane keeps them in there. The cytoplasm helps because its what they are in. And the organelles themself.
15964	cells use miosis, which is when the cell divides. they also use osmosis, which fights off bacteria and viruses. another proccess they use is meiosis.
15965	Active transport uses energy to move things across the membrane.
15966	there are several proesses used to stop the movement of substances across the cell surface. The first process used is the process of Liquidation. this uses the water on top of the cells movement to act as a barrier to stop things getting into the cell. Second is the cell wall. this also blocks out large substances from getting into the cell and damaging it. Lastly is defences on the inside of the cell that capture and expel bad substances from the cell
15967	nucleous nucleolous and cell wall

15969	Cell Wall - Controls what enters and leaves the cell.Osmosis - Is the diffusion across a semipermeable membrame.Diffusion -
15970	Cells have a slectivly permiable membrane that blocks some unwanted substances and lets the good in. They also have a cell membrane that protects the cells organelles from substances.
15971	THEY DIFFUSE LIQUIDS FROM INSIDE TO THE OUTSIDE, THEY USE SUGARS TO TRASPORT THINGS AROUND, AND THEY HAVE ORGANELLES THAT CAN TRANSPORT THINGS AROUND THE CELL.
15972	Three processes used by the cells to control the movement of substances across the cell mebrane is called flagelum, ribosome, and golgiapperatus.
15973	there is mitisis and other ways that stuff if passed along
15974	The ribosomes transport them. Through the cytoplasm.
15975	The cell opens it's self up; digests the materal it has taken in; and shots the waste material out of the other end.
15976	translation.transcription.&mutation.
15977	Cells control movement of substances across the cell membrane by having 'gates' that decide weather the substance is wanted or not and lets it in if it's wanted or blocks it out if it's unwanted. The cells
15978	One way of moving sustances is osmosis, osmosis is the movement of water through a semi-periable membrane. Osmosis takes no effort and disposes of excess water and keeps homeostasis. Another form of moving substances is passive diffusion, which is making the enviornment inside and outside the cell equal. This takes no effort and can move more than just water but other soultions as well. Lastly, another way to move a substance is facilitated diffusion which is moving a substaince against the concentraition gradient. This method of moving substances takes effort and is diposed of through a special protein.
15979	the cell membrane is what controules the body. it tells the body what to do and what to say
15980	One is the nucleus to send messages to different things to tell them where to go. Two is the nucluic envolope to let certian things in and out. Three is certian stops or codes the oranalle catches on to, to tell it were to stop.
15981	Translation-using water to move across a cell
15982	mieosismitosis cell transformation
15983	Active Transport- water goes through the cell to bring in certain nutrientsDiffusion- fluid diffuses across the menbraneSimbiosis- fluid symbiosises across the membrane
15984	The cytoplasm helps control what can be moved throughout the cell. The Cell Membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell. The Cell wall helps protect the cell for bad things entering.

15998	Cells may use vacoules, passive transtport, and active transport.
15999	One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be that there is a cell membrane which is semi-permeable. Semi-permeable means that only certain things can get into the cell. This type of membrane controls the movement of substances across the cell because certain things cannot get into and then move around in the cell. Another process used by cells would be information transfer where organelles in the cell transport DNA and rNA throughout the cell's system. A third process used by cells is when the lysosome come around and sort of 'clean up' dead organells and recycle them. This affects the cell because then certain organelles are dead and can no longer help the cell or move around in it.

16007	respiartion, mobement of oxygen into the celltranspiration, movement of moisture into and out of the cellcytokinesis, movement of materials through the cell membrane
16008	Endocytosis is when the cell's membrane wraps around a substance outside of the cell, and part of the membrane disolves, letting the substance inside the cell. Exocytosis is when a substance inside a cell gets wrapped inside the cell's membrane. Part of the membrane disolves, letting the substance out of the cell.
16009	They multiply.
16010	To control the movement across the cell membrane, cells can use a variety of functions to regulate subsatnces across the membrane.  They can use enzymes which act like catalyst, they can also use functions of some cells to control where substances are put in the membrane.

16024	Osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion are the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. In osmosis, it is the movement from higher concentration to lower concentration across a membrane. The soutes are being dissolved in to the solvent and can readily do so on their own. With this there are three types of solutions: hypotonic, hypertonic, and isotonic. In facilitated diffusion, it is movement from higher to lower concntration across the membrane as well with tings that can not readily pass through on their own. These then use the help of thing such as sodium potassium pumps and ion channels. in diffusion, it is also the movement from higher to lower concentration. These things do not need assitance passing through and can readily do this own their own unitl they reach equilibrium, in which all things are balanced and even.
16025	They control the energy flow
16026	The cell membrane controls what comes into the cell and what comes out. The cell also breaks things down and the ribosomes helps control the cell membrane.

16028	MiosisMitosis cell respiration
16029	endocytosis is when something moves into the cell, exocytosis is when something moves out of the cell, and mitosis when the cell seperates and divides.

16031	The use of ribosomesThe Endoplasmic Reticulum, pathway, can help move substancesThe Golgi Apparatice can also help move substances
16032	The cell slowly pushes things to get out of the cell against the membrane on the inner area.  Then the thing that needs to get out is forced between the membrane, then it is pushed out.
16033	passive,
16034	They have cytoplasm in which they use to move substances across the membrane.
16035	The three processes that control movement are ER which carries
16036	one of this processes is diffusion, diffusion makes cells from a high consintration to a low consintration.
16037	The three process used by cells to control the movement of substance across the cell membrane.Cell wall is one of the substances. Another one the substance are the nucleus. The final substance is the cell membran
16038	Transporting proteins, through the cell membrane, and diffusion
16039	Blood flow could be a major part of this.
16040	One is using a flagellum to help movement.
16041	There are different proteins in a cell membrance.The nucleus is in the cell membrane.Eukaryotes is one of the movment substances that control the cell membrane.
16042	In order to control movement of substances cells use cell to cell contact, hormonal signals, and membrane proteins. Cell to cell is simply what it sounds like. It is a process that results in the contact of two cells that allows substance movement. In hormonal signals, hormones transmit different signals that allow substances to move through the membrane. The function of the membrane protein is to control what enters the cell and this allows substances to enter the cell and move through the membrane.

16044	Three processes are diffusion, osmosis, and absorption.
16045	they can use obsorbtion of water, their spindels, or respiration
16046	The flagumelle is a tail like whipe thats at the end of the cell.  it moves around making the cell move.  the chellie are hair like steams that move like paddles making the cell move
16047	1. The cell membrane contains all of the organelles within the cell.  It keeps everything in tact.2. The liquid-like substance within the cell controls the movement of the organelles by keeping everything in place, but allowing them to move about easily.3. Other organelles read what is coming in and going out of the cell.  They determine whether the substance is harmful or not and act accordingly.

16052	cell can control what comes in by endocytitis and things that come out by exdocystis, and metsis.
16053	Three proceses used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell memberane are diffusion, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Duffusion is when the cell splits apart into more cells. Endocytosis is when the the the cell need the surrounding layer to form, and when something has to re-enter the cell. For exocytisis, the cell already has the surrounding layer for the substances to move across it, the cell won't let anything else come in.
16054	Each cell is composed of a membrane with many proteins that allows substances to move across, through the portein. Another process is osmosis. The eell must balance its inside and outside, so it must move water and other substances across its membrane to make everythign equal. The cell diffuses other substances through the membrane without using the proteins.
16055	Cells use membrane pumps, diffusion, and osmosis to control movement across the cell's membrane. Membrane pumps can help move the substances with or against their concentration gradiant to get them where they need to be. Diffusion helps control what substances move through the cell membrane by trying to reach equilibrium. Osmosis controls water movement across the cell membrane.
16056	1. Osmosis- when water goes from a high concentration to a low concentration. 2. They go through diffusion. 3. The cell membrane helps filter things from coming in and out.

16062	1. Filters and protects
16063	They use the faglleum to move around the cell membrane.
16064	The cell uses osmosis to slowly take in the nutrients that it needs. Cells also use diffusion.

16066	1. THEY USE FLAGELM2. THEY MOVE PROTIENS3.
16067	Cells control the movement of substances across their cell membrane by a selectively permeable membrane. The membrane can either surround a substance and bring it into the cell, or it can open up part of its cell membrane.
16068	Three processe that are used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane would be:1. The cell wall2. The mitochondia3. The cytoplasm
16069	walks across the cell, sliding across the cell, and runs across the cell
16070	Active TransportPassive TransportProtein Chanels
16071	The Cell will leave and reenter the membrane.
16072	The lysosome gets rid of unwanted particles in the cell.The nucleus controls the cell.The cell membrane is in control of what leaves and enters the cell.
16073	One way is that they carry them. Transfer themand mutate them
16074	Cells make proteins to keep substances off the cell membrane. They create integral and peripheral proteins with the help of ribosomes. Vesicles transport things to and from the membrane by traveling through the cell. Lysosomes can transport bad substances from the membrane and flush them out of the cell.
16075	One thing controlled by the cell is the Golgi Apparatus, it controlls what happens to the cells, if the go in or out. also, it controls what comes in, such as germs, they try to block those as much as possible.
16076	The fat moves throught the cell wall and the same for everything else.
16077	selective permiability
16078	One type of process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is facilitated diffusion. This method requires the use of energy to get larger molecules that cannot regularly diffuse across the cell membrane. Another method used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is the regular diffusion of water or other small particles across the cell membrane without the use of energy. Cells I don't believe can control the movement of substances here. Laslty is diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of particles again that are still small enough as if it was osmosis, but it moves differently. These particles move from low-concentrated areas to high-concentrated areas of particles.
16079	osmosis,homeiostasis,
16080	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are, the Krebs Cycle, Calvin Cylce and Short Cycle.
16081	1. Waste is dispelled through the cell membrane to eliminate it from the cell.2. Water is absorbed and transfered througout the cell when it is needed.3. Food is transfered throughout the cell to supply vital nutrients to the cells organelles.
16082	One type of process a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane is facilitated diffusion which is a type of passive transport. Another example is osmosis. This too, is a type of passive transport. A third example of a process in which a substance is moved across the cell membrane is the sodium-potassium pump.  The sodium-potassium pump transfers 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions into the cell.  The sodium-potassium pump is an example of active transport.  One other example is diffusion which is a type of passive transport.
16083	diffusionosmosisproteen chanals
16084	1. Passive Diffusion- Big partacles are pushed through marker proteins to get into the cell2. Active Diffussion- particles that need to leave and go the opposite way, the cell requires energy.3. Osmosis- particles that freely move back and forth the membrane to reach equalibrium.
16085	Active Transport is where the cell moves substances across the membrane with the help of the cell's energy.Passive Transport is where the cell moves substances across the membrane without using any of the cell's energy.Facilitated Diffusion is where the substance inside the cell is too large or unable to pass through the membrane on its own.  Therefore, transport proteins help the substance pass through the membrane.

16087	diffusionstopping rolling
16088	passive
16089	The cell membrane is semipermialbe so it will only allow certain things into or out of the cell.
16090	There arew parts that only let water though. Also the membraine can choose  to leave things in or make them leave. The membrain blocksa unwamted things like waste.
16091	There is osmosis which is the movement of water through semi-permiable cell membrane. There is passive transport, which is the movement of things through the cell membrane without the use of energy. Lastly, there is active transport which is the movement of things through the cell membrane with the use of energy.
16092	The three processes by cells include transfusion, that helps move across to cells, intechange, which cells help the substances during their feature to be able to move across the membrane, diffusion, which helps the substances to move across the membrane faster and without interruption.
16093	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are Messenger RNA, Transfer RNA, and Ribosomal RNA. MRNA is the RNA that uses messenges that are sent from one part of the body to the cell membrane in order to tell the membrane what it is that is needed to be done in the body. TRNA is the RNA that is used to transfer greatly needed data to the cell membrane; however, Ribosomal RNA is used to transfer the needed amount of ribosomes to the cell membrane for more protection for the cell.
16094	osmosis. the duffusion of particles across a permeable mambrane
16095	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be the chloroplast, ribosomes, and mitochondria. Chloroplast controls the movement of substances because it is the only thing, besides the ribosomes, that float freely in the cell. The mitochondria controls everything in the cell. It is the brain of the cell, it can make anything move anywhere it wants to.
16096	sodium-potassium pump, sloped gradient, and vesicles
16097	One process widened up the protein channels letting bigger proteins get in and out of the cell. Protein channels help  proteins get across the cell quicker and easier. Another process helps proteins get into the cell telling them where to go.
16098	They use energy to push the organic nutrients to different parts of the cell.the cell membrane controls what moves in amd out of a celllysosomal properties such as exporting and importing nutreints to and from the cell membrane.
16099	One process is diffusion. This is when substances move across the membrane from high concentration to low concentration. Another process is osmosis. This is when water moves across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration.The third process is
16100	Osmosis, active diffusion, and something else that I can't remember.
16101	One process is called diffusion which is when liquid matter slowly phases through a membrane, another process is cellular respiration which is when the cell is in need of oxygen, and the last is called protein sythesis which is when the cell creates ATP.
16102	cells control their movement by recieving infomation from the nuclei
16103	Cellls move thought the body to help control the bodys bood. There are also white blood cells that help provent the body from getting diseases. Cells just help with the movement of the body and helps how the body funcations work.
16104	Diffusion- the movement of substances from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentrationOsmosis- the diffusion of water across a membranehomeostasis- maintaining internal
16105	They can use organelles to control something. They can use a little exoskeleton type structure. Also there is an organelle that helps move other organelles through the cytoplasm.

16110	interphase, anaphase, prophase
16111	Diffusion is used to move substances to an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.  Diffusion does not require energy because it goes along with the gradient.  Osmosis is used to move water molecules to an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.  Osmosis does not require energy because it goes along with the gradient.  Active transport is used to move substances to an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration.  Active trasport requires energy because it goes against the gradient.
16112	The mitochondrian move the waste in and out of the cell.  The mRNA information to the cell.  The tRNA makes the information.

16125	The cell uses diffusion, a movement of particles that are from a highly concentrated area to an area much less concentrated.The cell uses equilibrium, a movement where all the particles are evenly spaced randomly.The cell uses osmosis, which is water through the cell.
16126	DiffusionFacilitated DiffusionOsmosis Diffusion occurs when particles flow through the cell membrane along with the dynamic equilibrium.Facilitated diffusion occurs when transport proteins help particles through the cell membrane.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane.
16127	Osmosis, Passive transport, diffusionIn osmosis, water seeps through the membrane of the cell.In passive transport, protiens move in and out of the cell and take molecules with them.In diffusion, molecules diffuse across the membrane.
16128	*communication *cell division*reproduction
16129	One process is Diffusion.  Diffusion allows materials to flow from where there are higher concentrations of that substance to where there are lower concentrations of that same substance.Another process is active transport.  It allows a cell to control exactly which materials enter or leave the cell, but it also expends energy.Another process is the use of protein channels.  These allow only one specific type of molecule to enter of leave through that  channel.  These distributed across the cell membrane allow the cell to control what enters or leaves.

16132	The cell wall stops the other cells from moving in and out of the membrane. It makes sure no hurt full cells can get in.
16133	The process used by the cell is by staying hard and not letting anything through that it is not suppose to.
16134	Cells use osmosis.  This is the diffusion of water from higher concentration to lower concentration. Passive Transport is used also.  This is where chemicals and particals pass through the cell membrane without using energy.Active Transport is the last one that is used.  This is where larger particles are moved in and out of the cell through the membrane.  This process uses energy.
16135	1.Cells allow different things to enter and leave the cell membrane2.
16136	The three processes used by a cell to control movement are flagellum, cilia and pores on the outsides of the cell.
16137	They use osmosis, cytoplasm, and nucleus to control this.
16138	I don't know. Their organelles control the movement.
16139	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is cell division, mitosis, and meiosis. Cell division basically includes the other two processes. Mitosis and meiosis both are processes in which divide the cell in half or into four different cells. They move all the substances within that cell to each other cell evenly.
16140	one of the tree processes that cells use to control the movement of substances acroos the cell membrane are
16141	CELL REGULATORS.
16142	THE CELL USES FLAGELLA TO MOVE AND MOVES AD STUFF
16143	Cells use osmosis- which is a simple diffusion used with water and no energy is needed; facilitated diffusion, which also requires no energy; cells also use active transport when energy is needed to move against the concentration gradient.
16144	One, is osmosis, were water is able to move in and out of the cellTwo, oxygen defusion
16145	One process used by cells to control the movement are the pores. They let things in and out. Another process is
16146	ProtistAnegellaMitosis
16147	Three ways for cells to process a cell's movement across the cell membrane is to control the cells, to control what is happening in the body, and finally to be able to control the system of movement.

16152	Homeoasits: shivering when cold.
16153	THE CELLS HELP TO KEEP MOVEMENT IN THE BRAIN AND THEY KEEP THE BODY CLEAN
16154	They use Flagella to move themselves around. They use something sticky to stay on one thing or another and to pull themselfs from place to place. They use other organisms to stay on and they move when the organism moves.
16155	OSMOIS DIFFUSIONDIFFISION
16156	Diffusion, Osmois, and something else.
16157	Osmosis lets water go into and out of cell. The cell wall is selective on what substances it lets in the cell.
16158	mRNA transfers different objects across it. It will move proteins around. mRNA also sends of the nucleus's message through the cell membrane to different parts of the cell. In between the 2 lipid layers, there is a transport object that helps move things in and out of the cell.
16159	Cells use Osmosis-Uses energy to get materials across waterActive transport- When a cell uses energy to move materials across the membranePassive transport- When the cell dosent use energy to move objects across the membrane
16160	Cells can use osmosis to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Osmosis is when water difuses through a barrier to the other side of it. Diffusion also can be used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Diffusion is when a substance moves from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Transcription can be used, as well, to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Transcription is when a protein is translated and then moved across the cell membrane.
16161	ACTIVE TRANSPORTOSMOSIS
16162	1. some cells have a flagllum that can make them move around.
16163	The cell is surrounded inside by the cytoplasm. That holds all of the organelles together. The second way is to travel through all the organelles one at a time. The final way is when the substance is entering or leaving the cell through the plasma membrane.
16164	The first type of movement that the cell membrane uses to control the movement of substances is passive transport. This means that the substance being transported will be on the higher side of the concentration gradient and be pushed across the membrane so that both sides will be at a state of equilibrium. The second type is active transport. This means the substance will be pushed against the membrane, from being in a less dense to more dense side. This takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzyme.The third type is osmosis. The cell will have to take in water to maintain its functions work properly, and the substances may be in the water that the cell takes in, allowing the substance to cross the cell membrane.
16165	Cells have a selectively permeanble membrane meaning that they only let certain things into them.  This happens in two ways, osmosis and diffusion.  Osmosis is the crossing of water through the cell membrane and diffusion is the crossing of other things.  One way that a cell allows things into it is active transport.  When a cell has to use active transport, it has to do something to let the object, or liquid, into the cell.  It has to use channel proteins to allow it in.  Another way that cells let things cross through the membrane is through passive transport.  Passive transport is more layed back and happens easier than active transport.
16166	I don't think that that we even did this but I'll try. Ummm one is the nucleous. The second would be traspertation. The third one would be cell wall.
16167	Cells move by using their body's shape to move. They are either spiral shaped, rod shaped, or flat. Spiral cells spin around, rods roll around, and flat cells hitch rides on moving substances.
16168	Cells use processes of all sorts they have a process which they let things in and out of the cell and they have processes of making cells

16176	1) The feelers on the outside of the cell feel to see if its a nutients or something they need. 2) Then the feelers decide on weather they want it3) If they don't want it then they get rid of it

16196	First of all, cells have a selectively permeable membrane.  That means that they control what enters and exits.  They also have active and passive transports where substances can also move across the cell membrane.  One last type of process is osmsois, or the act of moving water across a cell membrane.  Each of the previously listed processes preform the same job, and that is controlling the movement of any kinds of substances across the cell's membrane.
16197	Cells use meiosis, diffusion, and mitosis control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
16198	Carrying out of the cell.Making sure the things entering the cell are good for the cell.The blood moving the materials across the cell.
16199	Osmosis controls the water movement across the cell membrane. The cell membrane allows for substances that the cell needs in, and gets rid of the waste and unwanted material.
16200	The action of a cell is controlled by the shape of it. So with that being said one of the ways would be that the shape if the cell will help it move throughout the cell membrane. Another way would be that this cell is like a train- it has many stops but they all go to the same destination. Within the cell things go throughout many different places to get where they need to be, where they're actually traveling to.
16201	Diffusion - when water moves across the cell membraneActive Transport - when anything can move across the membraneSelective Transport - when only certain substances are allowed to move across the membrane
16202	#NAME?
16203	Osmosis is  the transfer of water across a membrane.There are carrier proteins that transfer P and K ions across a membrane.There are special tubes that open up to the outside that only allow certain types of substances across the membrane.
16204	1 osmosis allows water to pass through 2
16205	One of the processes used is cell reprouduction. Cell reproduction is when the cell is reproducing the same kind of dna or plant. Another process is  cell walls the cell wallsa are used to help control the movement . The third of the procexsses are the cell membrane. The cell membrane is used to stop the flow of how the  cells move.
16206	tail ,speed,and movement
16207	The process of substances moving from cell to cell is called osmosis. This is when substances move from the outside of a cell to the inside of the cell. Another process included in cell substance movement is called diffusion. The process of diffusion takes place when the percentage of a substance is higher on the outside of the cell than on the inside.
16208	Cell membrane controles what enters and leaves a cell, the Golgi apparatis makes the ribosomes that,and the nucleus codes all the protiens.
16209	Diffusion - The flow of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration using no energyFacilitated Diffusion - The flow of particles from an area of low concentration to an area of higher concentration using energy.Osmosis - The diffusion of water using no energy.
16210	Osmosis is used to diffuse molecules across the cell's permiable membrane. Also use protein carriers to determine what can move across the membrane.

16220	Cells have a membrane that allows only certain things to pass through. The membrane only allows small things to pass. It can't pass through if its too big.
16221	The first process is cell diffussion, when a cell links on to another.The secound process is when the cell that are two small or two big cant not enter.The third process is when the equalizes the level of starch in the cell.
16222	Respiration, translation, and transcription are three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
16223	1. Pushing them2. Telling them3. Making them

16225	Since a cells membrane is semi-permiable there are multiple ways for substances to enter the cell. The First is osmosis. Osmosis allows water to enter or leave the cell depending on the need. The second is Diffusion. Diffusion takes all substances other than water across the membrane, moving from area of high concentration to areas of low concentration. The third way is through facilitated diffusion. The cell pulls substances across the membrane that would otherwise be to large.

16230	The cells have to go through three processes to get to the cell membrane.  The first process is cell reproduction, the cell must reproduce itself.  The second process is cell transportation, so it can travel to the membrane. Finally, the third process is cell diffusion, the cell has to diffuse itself to finally reach the membrane.
16231	Cells divide and multiple in Meiosis and Mitosis, replicating thier genetics and the new cells do the job they are specialized for, and those cells divide and reproduce to keep the body going, and keep repeating the process of cellular division and replication so that these new cells can keep performing these jobs and keep the body and its functions going.

16234	Golgi Apparatus-moves and transports things.Indoplasmic Reticulum-carries things.Lysosome-Moves things to the right stop.
16235	Flagellum is one process that cells use for movement. They also use ribsomes to move. One other process is ER.
16236	It uses osmosis. Which, defined, is the process of transfering water across a cell membrane. Facilated diffusion is when substances are moved from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. There is also diffusion that is when substances are moved from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.
16237	Cells use proteins to allow substances in and out of a semipermeable membrane. Physical tubes may be constructed to allow certain materials through. Finally, certain substances are permentantly allowed entrance by certain ways into the cell.
16238	cells divede and become two. the cells separate
16239	mutation. crossing over. independent reproduction.
16240	Ribosomes is a process to make protein.Cytoplasm is the gel inside of a cell.Vacuoles are the processes in the cell that stores things.
16241	Diffusion is when materials move from a high concentration to a low consentration.  Facilitated diffusioj is when materials move from a low consentrated area to a high consentrated area.  Active transport is when the cell uses its substances to move other substances across the cell membrane.
16242	By having there cell membrane which covers their nucleus.Many cells may have their flagellum,and helps them move around.
16243	Osmosis-
16244	One is the flangella. Eaither one or many to help it propel its self.Another is a holdfast. This keeps it from moving so it can stay in one place, for example: some types of alge. Another type is connecting to eachother in the case of some green alge. It flotes at the water surface slowly moving with the tide. The more that is connected, the more food they get because they can take in more.
16245	One process that controls the movement of the cell is water, air and earth.
16246	Osmosis: The movement of water through a permeable membrane based on the concentration gradient. Water will move from higher concentration to lower concentration.Facilitated Diffussion: Like osmosis, but uses channel proteins to help guide in and out of the cell based on concentration gradient.Active Transport: Uses ATP. Concentration gradient does not dictate which way the substance can go.

16248	The cell uses organelles to move substasnces across the cell membrane. Like chloroplast, ribosomes, and vacules.
16249	HOMEOSTASIS
16250	it carry energy
16251	The cells use carrier proteins to transfer things across the membrane. They use endocytosis to move a substance that is to big in. They also use exocytosis to move cells out that are too large.
16252	1. Active transport- energy is used by proteins to move something across the cell membrane.2. Passive transport- no enery is required, a protein is inserted into the cell membrane and substances pass through it.3. Endosymbiosis- The cell membrane engulfs a substance and brings it into the cell.
16253	One processs is called transcription. In tramscription the tRNA acts as a taxi and pick's up material needed for the other parts of RNA.Another process is diffusion. This controls what moves through the membrane.

16259	THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO USE MOVEMENT TO CONTROL CELL MEMBRANE .
16260	Cells may use their membrane, cytoplasm, and tail to think and move the way they want.

16269	The three processes include flagellum which is a whiplike structure that moves the cell around. The others I can't remember.
16270	cell division , cell mutation , cell replication
16271	Diffusion does not use energy. This move molecues from a high concentration to a low concentrationActive transport helps move molecules across the membrane using energy.
16272	Endocytosis moves large substances into the cell using vesicles. Exocytosis moves large substances out of the cell using vesicles. The sodium-potassium pump uses an ion channel to keep the right balance of sodium and potassium in the cell. it does this by sending potassuim into the cell and soduim out of the cell.
16273	One process is that the cell may have protein channels that only let a certain amount of substances in to the cell at any given time. Another process is that a substances will use diffusion and spread the substances over the membrane and only let certain one in. One other process is that the can use diffusion to only let certain ones is because particles will want to go from a smaller space to a larger space not the other way around.
16274	The cells use the cytoplasm to carrie food and proteins to different parts of the cell. The cell also makes organells that like mRNA to go around the cell to make more protiens. And also ATP that goes to Ribissomes to make proteins.

16279	They have a cell wall that allows them do decide what organisims my enter teh cell, and whick ones do not.
16280	Cells use osmosis to move water across a permeable membrane.
16281	Each cell has a lipid bilayer which allows water in because it is polar and other subtances it keeps out. Another example is the cell wall of a plant cell which gives the call structure but also gives protction. A cell will also go through osmosis which is the process of bringing in water to the cell quickly. If nessicary a cell can use active transport to bring in nutrients that it normally would not use but at the time it needs.

16288	Diffusion:the movement of substances from higher to lower concentration.Osmosis:the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membranePotassium-ion pump:pump that helps potassium cross the cell membrane
16289	Passive Transport- requires no energyto make substances.Active Transport- requires energy to make substances.Osmosis- moving water.
16290	In the cells cell membrane, there are polar heads and non-polar heads. The polar head has a positive charge and the non-polar head has a negative charge. This allows water to flow through the cell.
16291	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are facilitated diffusion which uses proteins to allow water and larger molecules through the membrane by diffusion, Osmosis/ regular diffusion which uses the regulation of molecules on one side of the membrane be the same as on the other to keep water and small non-polar molecules in the cell and sometimes to get them out, and finally active transport by proteins is where a protein moves on the very outside of the cell membrane, grabs the molecule and moves back through the phospholipid bilayer to bring the molecule inside the cell.
16292	flagellum, cell membrane,cytoplasm
16293	The processes used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the ribosome and the mitochondrion

16295	the cell wall. the cell wall keeps all the cells orgionelles in place and blockes and other substtances from entering.the messenger cells. they carrie information to the cells nucleus.
16296	One process is used by willingly letting large substances pass through the membrane through holes in the membrane.Another process is used by taking the substance into a barrier, reading it, then letting it pass through.Another process is unwilling to the cell, but the substance forces itself inside the cell membrane.
16297	cellular communication cell reproduction
16298	Cells use simple diffusion to move substances across the membrane.  Simple diffusion involves substances (such as water) located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance.  For example, if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell, and a lower concentration outside the cell, then water will pass through the cell's membrane and go outside the cell.     Cells also use facillitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.  Facillitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.  This type of diffusion requires energy.     Cells also have special transporting proteins in their membranes that help move large substances into and out of the cell.  These types of substances would be too large to pass through the cell membrane just through diffusion.
16299	One process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membreane would be active transport, another is diffusion and the last one is osmosis. In active transport you go from a place of low concentration to high concentration and for the other two you go from high concentrationt to low concentration.
16300	prophase interphase and telophase
16301	diffusion is a type of passive transport where moleules move in and out of the cell through diffusion, osmosis is the movement o of water in and out of the cell in order to reach equilibrium, or two isotonic solutions. Endocytosis is the oving of food etc. into the cell for energy.
16302	The cell have to move through to carry out through the membrane
16303	Diffusion-When the concentration of water in the cell is less than the surrounding area and water flows into the cell.Osmosis-
16304	One process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is called Photosynthesis. Another is called Homeostasis.
16305	sed messages to your brain.so i hat case u will do what our rain tells you.
16306	The cells use the lysomes, cell membranes, and the cell wall if you are a plant cell.  They also use their fluids or plasmas to move things around the cell.  The cell membrane allows things to go in and out of the cell.  The lysomes help send important things to other parts of the cell.  The cell wall is used much like the cell membrane, but for plants.
16307	tHEY MIGHT USE THERE FLAGELLA
16308	The cell controls what enters and leaves the cell, the flagellen contols when it will move, and the Golgi body controls what liquid enters the cell.
16309	the nucleus,lysosmes,glogibodies
16310	They have a cell membrane which allows the cell to keep unwanted organisms out of the cell. It also has some small openings which can only be passed through by specialized organisms. Finally it has structures that act as gateways and require an activation energy toll to pass through the cell membrane.
16311	They all wrap around the substance and transfer it together.
16312	going from and out of the membrane is going in to the membrane with proteint
16313	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the ribosomes, the nucleus, and the proteins.
16314	Plant cells use respiration to turn ATP into food energy. Animal cells use mitosis to reproduce body celss. Gametes use miosis to divide and reproduce.

16320	The first is DNA, the next is RNA, then cell membrane.
16321	They can control what goes in and out of the cell by using proteins that only allow certain things in. They also use their phosphate bilayer to protect large things from going in the cell.
16322	1. Having Organelles.     - They have specific organelles that perform specific fuctions          to keep things organized and moving through-out the cell.2. Cell mRNA.     - Cell mRNA performs many tasks, leaving the nucleus with          messages that tell the rest of the cell what to do.3.Cell Respiration.     - Cell Respiration helps to get rid of harmful substances and            bring in important materials that the cell needs in order to            survive.
16323	crossing over,mutation,
16324	One type is diffusion. This is where the cell absorbs nutrients through the cell wall. Transcription is another. Transcription is where the cell allows water to pass through the cell.
16325	1. They have special receptors that only allow certain things to come into the cell. 2. Most cells contain a nucleus, which is like a brain, that controls what needs to be done. The nucleus also controls the ER which exports protiens. So only the bad stuff gets transported out of the cell. 3. Cells have special enzymes that allow them to take in material that may be too big to fit into a receptor. This allows them to take in important things that would not be allowed in otherwise.
16326	Absorption is when a substance is absorbed through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm.Ribosomes can carry substances through the cell membrance.The cell membrane can envelope substances by cellular respiration, thus bringing them into the cell.
