brandi and jerry did the following controlled experiment to find out how the color of an object affects its temperature
question what is the effect of different lid colors on the air temperature inside a glass jar exposed to a lamp
hypothesis the darker the lid color the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy
materials
glass jar
lamp
four colored lids black dark gray light gray and white
thermometer
meterstick
stopwatch
controlled experiment setup
procedure
1 put the black lid with the attached thermometer on the glass jar
2 make sure the starting temperature inside the jar is 24Â° c
3 place lamp 5 centimeters away from the lid and turn on the lamp
4 after 10 minutes measure the air temperature inside the glass jar and record as trial 1
5 turn off lamp and wait until the air in the jar returns to the starting temperature
6 repeat steps 2 through 5 for trials 2 and 3
7 repeat steps 1 through 6 for the dark gray light gray and white lids
8 calculate and record the average air temperature for each lid color
brandi and jerry were designing a doghouse use the results from the experiment to describe the best paint color for the doghouse
in your description be sure to
choose a paint color 
describe how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse
use results from the experiment to support your description
choose a color
black
dark gray
light gray
white
black  black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog  iknow this because in the results black got the hottest 
white  white because you wouldnt want the dog to get to hot 
white  the color white will reflect the suns rays off of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture  and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse painted black the dog would get to hot and die  so white
white  this color will keep the dog house cooler inside because it doesnt heat up as fast  the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes 
white  i would use alight color like white in this case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house the dog house is going to be hot like in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the jar the hotest 
light gray  the darker of color the  the hoter it gets
light gray  i think it will affect it by the doghouse atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
black  the color would absorb more heat from the sun making it hotter in the doghouse
light gray  i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons  in summer the light gray will reflect some of the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside  in winter the light gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside 
white  it will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees  there for if the dog house was painted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside 
black  the black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside  the average temperature with the black lid was 53  deg   the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48  deg   the average temperature for the light gray was 45  deg  and for the white it was 42  deg   there is a 11  deg  difference between the black and white colored lid  so the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside 
white  the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflected the light from the lamp in the experiment 
white  it would reflect a lot of the light and heat making it cooler inside the doghouse 
white  it will give the dog more cool air because lighter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
black  well the darker the lid is the more tempayure goes into the jar  and the avarege of the black lid was 53  deg  c 
white  they would want to choose white for the summer because it wont attract alot of heat  they would want to use black for the winter to attract more heat
dark gray  all choosable colors are waht you might call a double edged sword because  altough the dark colors will keep the dog warm in winter  itll make him to hot in summer  and while the light col ors will keep him cool in summer  they wont do much for him in winter 
black  it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
light gray  light gray is the best color to use because itself is that dark of a color so the dog wont burn up  darker colorincrea se in heat tempeture  and not that light that the dog would be cold 
white  brandi and jerry should use white paint because in the experiment  the jar with the white lid increased the least in temperature  it increased 18  deg  c while the black lid made the temperature increase 29  deg  c  therefore  the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesnt overheat 
white  the color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy 
light gray  on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotter temp  and on hot days it douse not absorb as much 
white  the best color to paint the dog house would be white  white reflects more light than black  this would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black  in the experiment  the white lid was at an average of 11  deg  c cooler than the jar with the black lid  therefore  the white would be the best color to paint the dog house 
light gray  the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog wont be to hot or to cold it will be just right
white  if they colored the doghouse white then it will be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black  because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53  deg  and when it was white the inside of the jar was 42  deg  c
dark gray  the air inside will be hotter than it would be with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war mat night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog wont get too hot during the day 
white  the color might affect the dog house just a little bit  because the white color had the lowest temp  compared to the black wich its average was 53  thats a  n  11  deg  c diferanc an the dark grey was a  n  6  deg  c differance  also the light gray was a  n  3  deg  c differance 
black  it will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
light gray  the light gray color would reflect some of the light energy  but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get too hot or cold  the white color had an average of 42  deg  c after 10 minutes  which might be too cold  the dark gray had an average of 48  deg  c  which might be too hot 
black  no color will affect the doghouse
dark gray  dark gray would be a good color for the doghouse because it would not be too hot inside  if you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat  in every trial for dark gray it created 48  deg  c  this seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house 
black  black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer 
black  i chose black because the sun wont reflect the color black and it wont effect inside the dog house 
white  it will make the dog house cooler
black  because its so string
white  it should be white  the white lid average was 42  deg  c and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experiment 
white  the white color reflected the most thermal energy and will keep the dog cool 
dark gray  it will make it warmer than alight grey or white doghouse  but cooler than a black doghouse  this is better because dogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter  and my color will keep it warmer  however  they are also used in summer  and as such should not be black  as that would make it unusable during summer 
black  the black doghouse would keep you warmer in the winter but it would be really hot in the summer
white  the color will keep the dog house cool on the inside so on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
black  black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53  deg  c  which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors  so to me i think black would be the best color 
light gray  i chose light gray becasue it wont make the dog feel sad 
light gray  the light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm  on average  the light gray colored lid went from 24  deg  c to 42  deg  c  a difference of 21  deg  c   compared to the black color ed lid  which went from 24  deg  c to 53  deg  c  a difference of 29  deg  c  which is too hot   or the white colored lid which went from 24  deg  c to 4 2  deg  c  a difference of 18  deg  c   therefore  a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse 
white  white will keep the dog house nice and cool since according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar coolest 
black  the black one will have a good heat for the dog because in the trial the black lid was average was 53  deg  c 
white  the color of the dog house will affect the temperature of the inside of the dog house  the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors 
light gray  i think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in the summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot 
white  brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse white because the color absorbs less heat  so it will keep it cool and not too hot for the doggy 
light gray  it wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days 
white  white would be the best color for the doghouse because it would keep the dog cooler  white would absorb less solar and thermal energy  therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse  in the experiment  the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42  deg  c  while the black lid jar averaged 53  deg  c  the light gray lid produced and air temperature of 45  deg  c and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48  deg  c 
black  black will make the dog house warmer inside because darker colors absorb more energy  and in air temperature the average temp  for black was 53  deg   while the average for white was 42  deg   every starting temperature started at 24  deg   therfore  black would be the best color to choose for the dog house 
black  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because in the chart lid color vs air temperture inside glass ja rblack hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3 dark gray  light gyay  and white where in the low to high 40s black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed 
light gray  the color light gray will affect the inside of the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you have a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot because in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly 
white  using white paint would be a great paint color for the doghouse because if its white it wont recieve that much sunlight and so it would be cooler  if you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45  deg  c so white would be a great doghouse color 
white  because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house 
black  if brandi and jerry use black  then the temperature will be warmer  because it has the highest average temperature at 53  deg  c if they use white  then it will bne colder  because the average when white was 42  deg  c  therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer it will be because black was 11  deg  c more than white 
white  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot days ohe or she dont get way to hot 
light gray  it would be a good color because it wouldnt be too cold or too hot for the dog  it would be just right 
white  on a hot summer day  its easy for dogs to get overheated  harming them and even killing them  therefore  white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases by 18  deg  c after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat  with black paint  it increases by 29  deg  c  which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health 
black  because the doghouse will have a higher temperature because black absorbs more solar energy  which will transform into thermal energy
white  i think the dog house should be white because it would keep the dog cool in the hot summer sun 
dark gray  i chose a darker color like dark gray  becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter  however  another reason i chose a dark gray instead of black is that its also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer 
white  because the lighter the colors are the least heat energy is going to be absorbed 
light gray  this would affect the doghouse because some light would be attracted to the house but not too much  in their experiment the light gray lids tempature was 45  deg   this would be a good tempat ure for the dog house because in the summer the dog would have enough shade so that it would not over heat  but in the winter it would be warm enough so that the dog would not be cold 
white  white would keep the dog house cooler  white does attract heat like the color black does  when started at 24  deg  c  the black lidded jar went up to an average of 53  deg  c  and the white lid ded jar  which also started at 24  deg  c  only went up to an average of 42  deg  c 
white  i would use white paint because it would keep the doghouse cooler  the doghouse will be cooler because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghouse cooler 
white  it will afect the dog house by the temp in side becaes the wight atracks less height
white  i chose white so it would be cool in the summer
white  the best color to choose would be white because on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
light gray  light gray will be that color because you could actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and maybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house black 
white  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature  the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb light 
white  it well allow it to be coler then bieng hot 
white  it might affect the temperature inside the doghouse  the data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature  therefore making it the best color to build the doghouse with 
white  the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day 
white  the white paint should keep the inside temperature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day  than say black paint for example  when comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the white lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature  on average about 6 6  deg  c cooler  compared with the averages for the other lids  so  therefore white paint is the better choice  especially if you are looking to keep the inside of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day 
white  in the expirement is stated that lighter col ors are cooler than darker colors white is a very light color and light c olors dont absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house wont be to hot 
light gray  light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much  its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it would keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool 
white  if the dog house was white then when it is hot the dog house would be cooler in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius 
white  white will affect the dog house by making it cooler  in the trials  the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature was 
dark gray  dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold 
black  black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat  black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light  in the experiment  the black held an average of 53  deg  c after being under the lamp for ten minutes  the white lid had an average inside temperature of 42  deg  c after beign under the lamp for ten minutes  this is a difference of 11  deg  c and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light 
black  black will affect the doghouse by makeing it hotter 
white  the color i chose  white  would affect the temperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as high in temperature 
white  the color of the dog house being white wil cause the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight  this is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse  and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse 
black  the black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest 
black  if you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker 
dark gray  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature  according to their data  is 48  deg  c and its perfect temperature  not too cold nor hot  and it barely changes temperature 
white  the best color to choos for a dog house is whit because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated  the dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse 
white  lighter color means cooler house 
black  the best paint color for the house would be black because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would  the black lid was 53  deg   and all others were between 42 and 48  deg 
light gray  this color would effect the doghouse because it would not be to hot or to cold 
white  the color black tends to make things hotter and so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day  for the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased  t emp54  and for the white it decresed  temp42   this is because the energy is sucked out from the dark colors  also dogs have alot of fur so it would be best to have a cooler house 
white  i would paint the dog house white  the highest temperature was 53  deg  for the black lid  which would cause the dog to overheat  while the lowest temperature was 42  deg  for the white lid  which would help the dog stay cool  so i would paint my dog house white because it is 11  deg  cooler than painting it black 
white  the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
dark gray  i dont think it will efect it because it has the same number for each trial
white  i think white is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find 
black  it might blow it up
white  this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
white  it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
white  it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better  as it said in the results  it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degrees celcius
light gray  i chose light gray as a good color for the doghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black  the color black which absorbs a lot of energy  results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as light gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures  based on the experiment  the results show that that light gray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45  deg  c  8  deg  c less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures  therefore  a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray 
black  the darker the doghouse color  the greater the increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs more energy  in the experiment  the color black absorbed the most energy  causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest  the results for black we re 54  deg  c  52  deg  c  54  deg  c  and 53  deg  c  while all the other colors that were lighter  absorbed less energy 
white  i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors  dark gray  black  light gray  the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors  white  the sun reflects off of it so white would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white  what would u pick
black  dark colors like black and dark gray absorb more energy and make it hotter than if i used white or light gray 
white  it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
black  the doghouse will be warmer  the doghouse will be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest 
light gray  they would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool  the tests showed that dark or light gray is about 46 5  deg  c so it will be good for the dog 
dark gray  i think dark gray because in the summer it wont get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to keep the dog house fairly warm 
white  how the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat  so the dog wont be as hot  if brandi and jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its   deg  c  was 54  in trial two its   deg  c  were 52  in trial 3 its   deg  c  were 54 and the average is 53  so these results show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not make the dog comfortable with all the heat  while the white lid in the experiment had very low temperatures its   deg  c  were 42  43  41 and its average came to 42   deg  c  so this shows that the white will absorb barley any heat 
black  black would be the best color to paint the doghouse  because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the doghouse warm  according to the results of brandi and jerrys experiment  lid vs  air temperature the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer than any of the other colored lids  so  therefore the black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors 
dark gray  because that would be the color to choose
white  i chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter  the reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is because in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus  and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house 
dark gray  it might get a little warm in the day time but it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night 
white  the color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house  i say this because the average temp of the color white is 42  deg  c while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp 
light gray  this could color might affect the doghouse  because the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temperature outside the doghouse 
white  the color white might affect the inside of the doghouse by keeping it the coolest  the average for the color black was 53  deg  c  the average for dark grey was 48  deg  c  the average for light grey was 45  deg  c  and the average for white was 42  deg  c  this shows that white is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to keep the doghouse cool 
white  if the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold  and when it is cold outisde the dog has fur to keep him warm 
white  the doghouse will stay cool because white reflects all the colors heat so the house will stay cool 
black  the color black heats the doghouse the most  it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey48 degrees  light grey45 degrees  and white42 degrees  so black would be the best color
dark gray  the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
black  black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy 
white  white was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out 
white  the internal temperature of the doghouse will be cooler than a doghouse that is colored black  this is only the case if the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place 
white  white is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for  after all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day i chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray  dark gray  or black lidded jars  with a starting temprature of 24  deg  c for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42  deg  c while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53  deg  c was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11  deg  c cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid  which is quite a diffrence if you ask me 
black  the doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if heshe has to stay outside  when the black lid was used in the expiriment  it was on average 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid  8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid  and 11 degrees warmer than the white  therefore  if the doghouse is painted black  the dog will keep warm much better than if the doghouse was painted dark gray  light gray  or white 
black  having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the hot lamp experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors 
light gray  the darker the color  the warmer the doghouse would be  black warmest 54  deg  c   the dog might overheat if the doghouse is too hot  the lighter the color  the colder the doghouse  white lowest 41  deg  c   they wouldnt want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold  so dark grey or light grey would be best  avg  46 5  deg  c  
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light grey because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so that is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and its not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45  deg  and for black it was 53  deg  and dark grey 48  deg  and for white was 42  deg  light grey is the average of them all  53  black   48  dark grey   5 53  black   45  light grey   8 and 53  black  42  white   11 light grey  8  is in the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should paint the dog house 
black  it will make the dog house warmer inside
light gray  light gray would be the best color for the dog house because it would absorb some heat  but would not absorb as much a sthe color black  if they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperature of the black lid jar rose 29  deg  c but the light grey lid jar only rose 21  deg  c  since black absorbs so much heat  it could cause the dog to be to hot  but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just not as much 
light gray  the color would keep the dog house cooler than the darkgrey and black color also its warmer than the white colored house 
black  the color black absorbs all the colors of light so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbing and trapping the heat from the light 
light gray  dark colors makes things really hot for example the black reached up to 54 c white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43 c the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46 cat most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold 
white  white will be better for the doghouse because it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat  if black was used it absorbs more heat then lighter colors would 
black  cuhzz it will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr  so yahh    
black  the color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog  also on trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54  deg  c which is to high the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42  deg  c after 10 minutes 
white  it would make it nice and cool for the dog
white  the temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black 
white  brandi and jerry would want to paint the dog house light gray  painting the dog house light gray would be the best paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had found out that  painting the house black absorbs more heat energy  and painting it white will not absorb enoff energy  so in the middle will be the best for the dog  so not too much thermal energy  but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best 
white  the best one would be white  because the white one absorbs less energy  the black one absorbs a lot of energy  the ave rage of the black one was 53  deg  c  average for the dark gray was 48  deg  c  the average for the light gray was 45  deg  c  and the white was 42  deg  c  the darker the color the more energy it absorbs  the lighter the lesser it absorbs energy 
white  the color white wont attract as much light as the black so the dog wont have to suffer really hot weather on sunny days  the white compared to the black is abetter choice because black color attracts more light  for example it averaged a 53  deg  c while the white averaged a 42  deg  c  that is all  deg  c difference 
black  so the dog will stay warm at night 
white  because it could get dirty or somethen 
black  i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53  deg  c and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
white  well the color white makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse 
white  i chose white because the darker colors absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
black  i believe that the best color for the dog house would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to the data table in hot lamp so the darker the color the warmer the house or object 
white  according to the reults  the lighter the color  the colder the temperature is  since white had less heat  they would want to paint the dog house white 
black  if the doghouse is black then it will be warmer  i know this because the jar with the black lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c
white  the color white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature  on average  the color black is 53  deg  c  dark grey is 48  deg  c  light grey is 45  deg  c  and white is 42  deg  c 
black  this color will keep the inside of the dog house warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy 
light gray  light gray might affect the the doghouse by keeping the inside colder for the dog 
white  by painting the doghouse white  the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment  the data shows that when the lid was black  the air temperature was warmest  and when the lid was white  the air temperature was coolest  therefore  painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature for the dog 
light gray  because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
black  black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
light gray  light gray would be a great color for a doghouse  although it can still cause an affect  the light gray color can cause the dog house to not have the right temperature in side  the results would be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperature inside the dog house  like in trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44  in trial 2 the temp  was 45  trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature  the average was 45  so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp  is not as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside 
white  white  it is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18  deg  c  in the experiment  the starting temperature of was 24  deg  c and after ten minutes under a lamp  the air inside the jar increased by 18  deg  c  total of 42  deg  c  if black was chosen to be the doghouse colour  it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise would be too high 
black  the darker the lid color the greater the increase in air temperature
black  the wood will be hot
white  white would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black  dark grey  or light gray 
white  the white paint would keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the sun  because it reflects the most energy  therefore having the lowest internal temperature 
white  white would be the best paint color for the doghouse  in the experiment  the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42  deg  c  the black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53  deg  c  the dark gray lid jar averaged 48  deg  c  and the light gray lid jar averaged 45  deg  c  the white lid jar was the coolest out of the four 
black  it will be warmer inside of the dog house 
dark gray  the best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray  in the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48  deg  c and was the second highest temperature  the highest temperature was the black lid with 53  deg  c  the difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5  deg  c  if using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm  but yet be a bit cool for them too 
white  white  because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature  about 42  deg  c  in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest 
black  this color would affect the dog house because the black would absorb energy from the sun and make the inside of the dog house hotter then the rest of the colors
light gray  with alight gray dog house the temperature inside the house would be cool in the summer  but warm enough for the dog in the winter  with this balance in temperature you dont have to worry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season 
dark gray  it didnt get any hotter or cooler  therefore it is the best paint color for the dog house because the dog would not be too cold  nor too hot 
light gray  light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white  meaning light gray is in the middle 
white  in the hot summer months the dog house wont get too hot 
black  the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to warm for the dog to sleep at night 
light gray  because it stays at a liveable temp  of 45 degrees 
white  if they paint the doghouse white then when the dog goes inside it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there 
dark gray  the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer  the dark gray was an average of 48  deg  c which is not as hot as the black lid which was an average of 53  deg  c and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45  deg  c 
black  the color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
white  the white color will attract less energy than the others  thus making the doghouse cooler
white  the color would affect the paint house because  if it is a black colored house  it will be super dark  if it was a white color house it would be more lighter  during night time
light gray  because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm 
white  the color on the outside will either heat up or cool down the doghouse and since white was still warm but not too hot so white is the best color for the doghouse 
black  the color might affect the dog house by attracting the heat to it
light gray  i would choose light gray because then the dog wont be too hot or too cold this is why i would choose light gray to paint the dog house 
white  this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler  i am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot  so i am choosing white  this color will keep the dog cool when it is hot and sunny  however  this color will not keep the dog warm in the winter  so i am not sure 
white  the color that might affect the doghouse is the white beacuse it was the one that got less then the other three colors
light gray  light gray would be the best choice  because you dont want the dog house to cold  but you dont want it to warm  and the average temperature for the light gray was 45  deg  c which is just right for a dog  because you dont want your dog to get to hot  and the black wouldnt be a good color  because darker colors absorb more energy  and there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid  making the light grey lid  the cooler  better choice 
white  white is a good choice because it will absorb less heat  the experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat  so it will keep the doghouse cooler 
white  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white  this is because white doesnt attract as much heat  i know this because in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius  using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot 
dark gray  dark gray will make the dog house a bit warmer  the data states that it is 48  deg  c always 
white  white reflects more sun  keeping the dog cooler in the summer heat 
light gray  light gray wont absorb too much sun in which case heating the interior  and it will absorb enough heat on cold days to warm inside 
dark gray  i choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the effect will be warm and cool at the same time  when you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an average of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too hot and it will not get too cold 
white  i think white would be the best color to paint the dog house  i say this because white absorbs less energy making the dog house cooler  in the experiment  the white on average was 42  deg  c  and that was the coolest temperature  the warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53  deg  c  for a dog inside a doghouse  i think it shouldnt be hot for the dog  thats why i chose the color that made the doghouse the coolest 
black  the black wood paint would effect the temperature more becaasue the darker a color the more energy in attracts  so the black one would be hotter than the white one 
light gray  if the color are ligth gray than the dog house the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz it light   
white  the dog house will not be to hot  the temperature will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot  white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time 
black  in my oppinion  brandi and jerry would want to paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48  deg  c which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors  i think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm  but during the summer it wont be to uncomfortably hot like black may be 
black  this color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this  this would help during winter 
white  usually a dog house is only used in the summer so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint  bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else along with their heat  but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color sand their heat  so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42  deg  c  the average temputure for lightgray is 45  deg  c  the average temp  for dark gray is 48  deg  c  and blacks average temp  is 53  deg  c  thats an 11  deg  c difference  whitch could be very important 
white  the color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get  if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot 
white  the color will heat up the doghouse to about 42  deg  c in 10 minutes  this is the best color to choose  because the black heated up to 53  deg  c in 10 minutes  therefore  the temperature of the white jar was 9  deg  c lower than the black jar  making the white cooler 
light gray  the doghouse should be light gray because that way the air temperature isnt to hot or to cold  its just about in the middle 
white  the color would affect the temperature inside the dog house  the black would make the temperature inside the greaterst then  the dark grey then  the light grey  then finally the white would have the lowest temperature just like the lid color  for the lid colors  black had an average of 53  deg  c  the dark grey had an average of 48  deg  c  the light grey would have an average of 45  deg  c  aand the white had an ave rage of 42  deg  c so the temperature for the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the jar 
white  choosing the lightest shade  white  is the best colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round  the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer  painting the hosue white will ensure that it stays as cool as it can over summer  thus making it the most comfortable for the dog  the white house will remain coolest because as according to the data collected  the average temperature will be aprox  42  deg  c  while for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures  45  deg  lgray  48  deg  dgray  53  deg  black   the white colour was 11  deg  cooler than the darkest colour  black   thus making it the best colour to paint a dog house 
dark gray  keep it cooler
light gray  alight gray color could give you less heat in the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth  since in the experiment the black lid would get the most heat you woulnt want a dog to get to hot  but also not to cold 
black  cause he might not wamt to sleep in the doghouse cause of the color of it and it might also mess the dogs eyes up to that could also be it in this experiment
black  it would make it really hot inside the doghouse because the color black attracks more heat  as aposed to colors that are very bright like white or light gray or light green even 
black  painting the doghouse black might affect it by attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat stroke while is laying inside 
black  balck becuase balck goes with every thing
white  this is the best paint color for the dog house because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp  in the jar the least
white  i would choose white because it is one of the lightest colors  also in the experiment it was proven that white stayed the coldest after 10 minutes  therefore in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it 
black  the dog house should be painted black because black absorbes heat  learned thin when the data table showed that the average tempature for black was 53  deg  c  when the dogs out at night you would most likely want it to stay warm 
white  because in the summer  the dog house wount get over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp experiment was 42  deg  c and the black was 53  deg  c 
light gray  the color chosen will affect the inside of the doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts  from the experiment  black attracted the most heat  or air temperature  with an average of 53  deg  c  and dark gray had an average of 48  deg  c  light gray had 45  deg  c  and the color white with 42  deg  c on average  based on these results  i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat  fewer than darker colors  but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment  the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat  therefore  light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse 
black  has the most average 
black  i think they should use a black for the doghouse because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint would help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53  deg  c
light gray  light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would 
dark gray  dark grey is best because in the winter the doghouse will absorbe heat  also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat  like if it was black 
light gray  it makes the doghouse a little cool but not too hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there and rest  on colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still be a little warm 
black  it wold atracket heat or inorge frume the sun
dark gray  it will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
light gray  the house wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middle
white  
black  i think black would be the best color for the doghouse  it will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars  the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature  this black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out  when it is warm outside and the dog gets hot  it can sleep outside 
dark gray  it had a steady temperature  and for outside  it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray 
white  if the doghouse was white  the inside of that doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because  like in the experiment  the color white only got an average of 42  deg  c  unlike the color black  which got an average temperature of 53  deg  c 
white  less heat will be attracted to it 
dark gray 
light gray  it will be warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
white  i have chose the color white because it had the least highest temperature  in the data from the previous experiment the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  making it the least hottest 
white  white would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42  deg  c compared to the average for black wich the average is 53  deg  c 
black  black would be the best color  because it would keep the house warmer  in the experiment  black produced the highest temperature inside the jar  53  deg  c 
light gray  it would absorb a little amount of heat for the summer time when its hot  but because its also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter  i know this because the black lid absorbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat 
white  becase it reflax the light
black  black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
black  the dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy 
black  that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it would be hard for the dog to see  it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40s but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
light gray  in the summer it will not abosrb much heat keeping the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amount of heat keeping the dog at least fairly warm 
black  the color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day  also it will affect it because the darker the color the greater the increase in air temperature in the doghouse it will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy 
black  black is the best color for the doghouse in order to keep the dgohouse warm  brandi and jerrys data showed that the darker the lid  or in this case  doghouse  the darker the color  the more increase in air temperature  which in the lid experiment  the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53  deg  c while others like dark gray and light gray had averages of 48  deg  and 45  deg  c 
dark gray  the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal thats living in it wont freeze or overheat  because the dark gray color in the experiment didnt collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place 
light gray  light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat  black dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat  white would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze  that is why light gray would be perfect for the dog house color 
white  i would choose white because it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldnt have to be super hot in the sun  the average temperature for white was 42  deg  after ten minutes and it was 53  deg  for black showing that black makes it hotter inside 
light gray  light gray will affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than it would with black paint  but warmer than it would with white  in warmer tempatures  the paint will not asborb as much sunlight  so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot  the black paint had an average tempature of 53  deg  c  while the light gray had an average tempature of 45  deg  c  that is a difference of 8  deg  c  the light gray will keep the doghouse cooler  but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint  the white paint had an average tempature of 42  deg  c  the light gray paint would keep the doghouse 3  deg  c warmer then the white paint  but 8  deg  c cooler than the black paint 
white  white will bring more light in the dog house because it is alight color and it attracts light and it will bring more in
black  black because it well make the dog house warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer 
light gray  the doghouse would be cooler in the summer and not as cold in the winter the light gray lid was cooler than the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment  the most comfortable color varies with the kind of environment and i am assuming this is a rather warm environment 
white  the best answer would be white because white is alight color that wont absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer  when brandi and jerry performed their experiment they found that when ajar had a black lid on it  the temperature inside the jar was an average of 53  deg  c  whereas  when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42  deg  c  that is an 11  deg  differance  there for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white 
white  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the average temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
white  it might not give it much light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more energy and light  just like with the jars and the lamp  the jar with a black lid had the highest average  therefore proving that darker colors attract more energy 
white  painting the doghouse white will reflect the sunlight making it cooler in there
black  well  darker colors absob more heat than lighter energy  so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse  when br andi and jerry used a black lid  dark color  for the experiment the results were in the low 50s range  5254  deg  c  but when they used the white lid  light color  the results were in the low 40s range  4143  deg  c 
light gray  in the summer the dog house will not be hot
dark gray  the dark gray wil affect the dog house because no matter what color the doghoue is  the room will still be dark 
dark gray  the dog house will be warm during winter so that the dog will warm and cofortable
white  this color will help the dog house cool because it is the clor that remained the coolest during the experiment 
light gray  i would go with light gray because in the experiment it was at a good temperature of 45  deg  f  black was to hot at a temperature of 53  deg  f  dark gray was a little to warm at a temerature of 48  deg  f  and white was a little to cold at a temerature of 42  deg  f 
black  if brandi and jerry were to paint a dog house the color they should choose is black  because its the darkest color so it absorbs the most thermal heat  my theory is correct because in bradi and jerrys hypothesis the darker the lid color  the greater the increase is air temperature in the glass jar  because darker color absorbs more energy 
white  using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then the other colors  the dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial  the dog house would be about 42 degrees and i know that because the first trial was 42 degrees  the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress  the average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use 
white  it would make the doghouse cooler inside
white  if you paint the doghouse white  it will be cooler inside than if you painted it black  since black absorbs more energy it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white 
white  they should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist  so if they use white it will not get to hot in the dog house 
light gray  the color of the dog house should be light gray because it doesnt absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53  deg  c and 48  deg  c in the experiment  so the dog wont feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around  they probably already are hot enough  also if it does get cold  light gray will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase its temperature was 48  deg  c which is only 2  deg  c less than dark gray  so i think light gray will be the best color for the dog house 
black  because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine 
light gray  the color white might affect the doghouse  be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler  but not too cold and at the same time not too hot  when the lid color of the glass jar was black  the average air temperatuire was 53  deg  c  after only 10 minutes  when the starting temperature was 24  deg  c  which i believe might be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse  when their was a white lid  the average temperature after the same amount of time  and starting at the same temperature of 24  deg  c  was 42  deg  c  which i believe would be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse  i believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot  nor too cold  because after 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24  deg  c  its average air temperature inside was 45  deg  c 
white  white is the best color for the doghouse because lighter colors absorb less energy  which is shown on the data chart  it has an average tempature of 41  deg  c versus the black lid which has an average tempature of 53  deg  c 
dark gray  dark grey would be good because it wont get to hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8  deg  c
light gray  it will cool and heat up the dog house
white  it will make it less hotter for the dog
black  if it was color black it would make the dog house hot 
white  white would make it cooler inside for the dog  because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in  also  it was cooler inside because whites average was the lowest  42  deg   
white  i think they should paint the color white  be cause white absorbs less heat than black does  because if black  dark gray  or light gray were to be painted on the doghouse  that would absorb more heat than white would 
black  if you paint the doghouse black  the inside of the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white 
white  white paint will make the doghouse less hot  because it attracts less energy from the sun 
white  white would be the best color to paint a dog house  because the light color soaks in less light than darker colors  br andi and jerrys experiment found that ajar with a black lid was 53  deg  c after ten minutes  but ajar with a white lid was only 42  deg  c 
white  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits it but it wont be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for the dog 
black  when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53  deg   when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42  deg  because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouses roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer 
black  now the doghouse can be warm in the winter  because dark colors absorb more light  and then the dog can just play around in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun  even dogs 
black  by painting the doghouse black  the air inside the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color  in the experiment  the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53  deg   which is 2  deg  higher than the dark grey lid  8  deg  higher than the light grey lid  and 11  deg  higher than the white lids air temperature  this shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it 
white  it wpuld make it less hot by having white because white is alight color and does not coduct that much heat as have bin shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest average at 42  deg  c
black  i choose the color black because it keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature  all the others had lower temperatures and the black was the highest temperature 
dark gray  dark gray may attract more heat to the dog house but no as much as black 
dark gray  the best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it wont be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the doghouse and it will also retain its temperature longer through out the night  the dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48  deg   that is better than the 53  deg  average for the black and the 45  deg  average for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will retain its heat 
black  the color black would effect the inside of the doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat  keeping the dog warm  as in the experiment  while the black lid was over the thermometer and the light was 5 centimeters away  the temperature on the thermometer increased by 29  deg  c 
dark gray  doghouse will not to hot or cold in summer and winter
light gray  light gray would work best because then inside the dog house it would still be warmer than outside  but when it was hot outside it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog house was painted black 
black  with the color black as the dog house the inside temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment was 53  deg  c  for dark gray ave  temp  was 48  deg  c  for light gray it was 45  deg  cave  temp   and for the white lid the ave  temp  was 42  deg  c  controlled varible temp  in jar before starting exp  respondingair temp  inside jar after 10 min  uder lamp manipulated lid color
black  the black color absorbs more energy so when its cold outside the inside can heat up by the sun
black  if the dog house is black it will increase the tempeture of the air inside the dog house  making it warmer inside it 
light gray  it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be couse of the coler that its not to dark adn not to light so it will keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
white  the reason they should pick white is because it will cool down the tempature in the dog house the reason i know that is in the data they did for the experiment it tells you that white is cooler than the rest of the colors
black  if a dog house was painted black  then the dog house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the air temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53  54  and 52 
white  this color will keep the dog house rather cool that way the dog will not over heat itself  in the experiment  lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature 
light gray  the light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold  this is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy  the light gray was about in the middle with 45  deg  c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog 
white  white will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest  meaning that white paint will keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of the other colors  the white lid kept the jar an average of three degrees celcius cooler than any other color 
white  if brandi and jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase the air temperature as much as black
black  i think black would beb best to use for the doghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out  the black color of the doghouse will keep it warmer  since darker colors absorb more energy than lighter colors  black was 53  deg  c after 10 minutes  while white was 42  deg  c that is a change of 11  deg  c warmer then the other 
dark gray  this color will keep the doghouse warm since it will probably be outside and it wont be to hot either 
dark gray  the dark grey would keep the doghouse warm  but not too hot  this is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the second warmest color 
dark gray  the color of the dog house will cang the air pressure in side
dark gray  i believe that dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house  although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer  it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat  also  the air wouldnt be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it  considering that dark gray had an average of 48  deg  inside  it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42  deg  and the black with an average of 53  deg  
dark gray  dark gray would be best to build a doghouse because it the temperture stays the same every single time  which means if its cold the temperture stays the same  if its hot  the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot 
white  white would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with the white lid  the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other jars 
dark gray  the tempeture inside the dog house will be warm 
white  they should use the white color because white doesnt heat up as fast  after 10 minutes  whites tempature was 42  deg  while blacks was 53  deg   that is an 11  deg  difference  so the doghouse will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white 
white  the color white is best for the doghouse because the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white had an average of 42  deg  c which means that the increase of air was cooler  so the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air flow and be cooler then any other color 
white  the white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors  so if they want to keep their dog at a cool temperature  then they should go with the white color  the average temperature for the black colored jar is 53  deg  c  the average temperature for the white colored jar is 42  deg  c  the black lided jar is 11  deg  c higher than the white lided jar 
black  it will usually always be 53  deg  c in the dog house because that is the average tempature 
light gray  the temperature of the doghouse with alight gray paint coating on it would make the doghouse warm but not cold or hot of a temperature of around 45  deg  celsius 
light gray  the dog will might sleep on the doghouse 
white  the white attracted the least heat than any of the other colors  the white low data for white was 41  deg  and the high data was 43  deg  
white  the white would keep the dog house nice and cool in the experiment white attracted the least heat  example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black 
white  painting a dog house white will keep it cooler than other colors  in the experiment white had an average temp of 42  deg  c while black had a 53  deg  c average
white  white would be the best color to paint the dog house  in the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat  staying at a temperature of around 42  deg   this would mean that the dog house would stay a cool temperature for the dog 
white  the white paint will be the coolest paint choice for the doghouse  in the data brandi and jerry collected  white had the lowest temperature average of 42  deg  c  the next coolest was light grey with an average of 45  deg  c  dark grey with an average of 48  deg  c and the hottest was black with an average of 53  deg  c  therefore white paint will make the doghouse the coolest 
black  since black absorbs more light than the dark gray  light gray  and white  it will make the doghouse warmer  this will help because in the winter when he needs the doghouse the most  it will keep him warm when he is inside of it 
white  white would be the best paint color for the dog house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot  this is because from the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got as hot as 54
light gray  light gray would affect the doghouse by keeping it slightly warmer in the winter  and cool in the summer 
white  it would keep the doghouse cooler  especially in summer months when there are high temperatures outside  ex in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42  deg   the coolest temperature of them all   this would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating 
white  if the dog house is white  then it will be cooler  since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42  deg  c  and the black lid made the inside of the jar 53  deg  c then we know that white will make the doghouse cooler 
black  by making the doghouse black it would absorve heat energy that will make the doghouse warmer than if it was a lighter color 
white  white would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot  this is because in the experiment the black absorbed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the data will make the doghouse cooler
white  white would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more energy than light colors 
white  if the doghouse was painted white  then the air temperature inside wouldnt change very much  it would be cooler 
black  the inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight  therefore it would become hot on the inside  results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors 
dark gray  according to the results that they got this color remained constant throught all 4 trials  this means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it will remain a average temperature of 48  deg 
white  decrease the tepmpature
white  hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black  dark grey  and light grey  the white was the lowest average tempatue a 42  deg  c
white  if they paint it white then the doghouse wont absorb much heat in the experiment the average temperature in a white lid jar was 42  deg  c
light gray  the dog might not be able to see it in the night 
light gray  if it was black and it was summer  the dog would be hot  and if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze  so light gray would be the best color for the dog  if the tempature was 24  deg  outside and the dog was cold  he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45  deg  degrees in his dog house  so he wont freeze as much as he would as if he was outside 
white  the black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees  the white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside 
black  this color might affect the doghouse  because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will rise from the dog house and making the doghouse hot 
white  white will keep the doghouse the coolest because the other colors got tempatures of 53  deg  c  48  deg  c  and 45  deg  c  but the white jar got 42  deg  c 
white  this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41  deg  c 
dark gray  the doghouse wouldnt be too cold or too hot  it would be right in the middle  black  which is 53 c  average  would be a little too hot and white  which is 42c would be too cold  so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house 
white  the white might let sunlight come in the dog house
black  black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it even hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
white  white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
black  black will affect the doghouse because dark c olors absorb more energy 
white  by choosing the color white  brandi and jerry s doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions  in the experiment  the average temperature for black lid was 53  deg  c  for dark gray 48  deg  c  for light gray 45  deg  c  and finally for white 42  deg  c  which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options 
light gray  i chose the color light gray light gray would make the dog house around 45  deg  c average on the inside  the results show that light gray was an average of 45  deg  c and black was an average of 53  deg  c  white was an average of 42  deg  c  light gray is 3 degrees warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black  light gray is a color in between the temperatures  leaving the dog house not to hot or not to cold 
light gray  would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer 
black  the other colors had between 40  deg  and 50  deg  but black is hotter then the other colors 
light gray  black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it attracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45  deg  compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53  deg  which would clearly be to hot for a dog 
white  white  because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black  in your data it shows that in the trials white will be the least hot color 
dark gray  i chose dark gray because the darker the color  the more heat it attracts  for example  during the winter  the dog inside the doghouse might get cold  so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside  but sometimes the dog might not want so much heat  so i picked dark gray instead of black  also  another example is in the summer time  if the dog doesnt want to go outside  and stays in the doghouse  he doesnt have to be so hot  but he can also go outside if the doghouse is to warm 
black  black because then in the winter when its get scold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it slightly warmer
white  using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day  the average temperature of the white lid was 42  deg  c and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53  deg  c  the white lid was 11  deg  c cooler then the jar with the black lid
light gray  it will keep it warm for those cold night and keep it cool for those hot summer days 
black  using a black paint color for the doghouse will make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most  due to the data  a black lid color had an average of 53  deg  c  that will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse much more warmer in temperature  a white lid only had an average of 42  deg  c  making it too cold for the dog  thats why a black doghouse is best for a doghouse to keep the dog warm 
white  white would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black  light gray  or dark gray because its the lightest color  this is good because in the summer  if the dog house attracted a lot of heat  the dog could over heat and get sick  the black lid got the hottest air temperature  having an average of 53  deg  c  dark gray was the second hottest  having an average air temperature of 48  deg  c  light gray had the second coolest air temperature  on average being 45  deg  c  and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42  deg  c  these results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat  and is therefore why i believe that a white dog house would be best 
dark gray  the dog house will be warm but it will probably always stay around the same temperature because in the trial dark gray was always 48 degrees celcius
light gray  light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when its warm the dog would not be too hot and when its too cold the dog would still be able to be warm  as you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghouse amp it was hot the dog which could harm the dog  and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing  so i believe that light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of the doghouse as much as the other colors 
white  i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside  and they said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar
white  if you paint it white the doghouse will be cooler in the hot summer sun  in the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42  deg  but it was 53  deg  for the black lid  you probably dont want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white 
dark gray  it will keep the doghouses interior at an average temperature
white  white would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is alight color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the darker the color the more enrgy it will absorb  in teh data table from their experiment  black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
black  the best paint color for the dog house would be black because the darker the doghouse the grater chance it will have out in the sun
white  the best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42  deg  c compared to the other temperatures  white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible 
black  black will efect the dog house alot in the summer because balck is an energy color 
white  this color will affect the doghouse by making it colder  if they live in a hot place this would be the best color to choose from 
white  i think that brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white  i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy  that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat 
dark gray  the best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog  i know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees c after 10 minutes of being under the lamp 
light gray  light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors  dark colors do not reflect light well  instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures  in winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer 
light gray  it will heat the doghouse up just enough to be the perfect temperature 
light gray  on hot sunny days the color of the house wouldnt absorb so much heat  so the house woldnt get so hot  but if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air  becuas e  lighter colors reflect heat  amp darker colors absorb heat 
light gray  because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
black  the paint color will help to keep the dog warm becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster 
white  the best color would be white because as shown in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler 
white  the color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler  i know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid 
black  in the experiment the black lid on the jar held the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature inside the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature  the black lid had the highest average temperature of 53  deg  c  dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48  deg  c  light gray had an average of 45  deg  c and white had the lowest temperature with 42  deg  c
white  white would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer  the average temperature of the whitelidjar was 42  deg   while the averge temperature of the blacklidjar was 53  deg   the white was 11  deg  cooler  so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer 
dark gray  if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse dark gray  i think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool enough in the summer  because dark gray has the mediumwarm temperature on the chart about the colored lids 
dark gray  i chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter  and cool in the summer 
white  in the experament the color white absorbed less heat  so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot 
dark gray  easy to light make stay drak
white  the purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain  white is a good choice because it let the least amount of heat into the jar  the tempature of the white jar was an average of 11  deg  c less than the tempature of black jar 
white  it will be cooler inside
white  this color will cool down the dog house  the results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than all other colors in the expirement 
light gray  i think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog  the dog would feel most comfertable in alight colerd house in the summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature  but in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze  the dog would want to be warm in the winter  in the expirament the black heated to 53  deg  and the white heated to 42  deg  c witch is a difference of 11  deg  c  that is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black  white or dark gray 
white  painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house  the jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar  the darker the color of the lid got  the warmer the inside of the jar was 
white  i think white because had the less average in side the glass  the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so their i would pick white because u can see them better
black  black might affect the doghouse because its going to be dark  hot  and not cmfortable 
white  i chose white because the white paint color doesnt abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air temperature inside wouldnt be as high as the other colors  so if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24  deg  c the average temperature would only rise up to 42  deg  c  but if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would be in the 45  deg  c  53  deg  c  so white doghouse would be a great pick for the color of the doghouse 
light gray  i picked light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool  this  color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter 
black  black will make the doghouse to hot  the dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable  in the lab  the black got way more heat then the others colors that were used 
white  white doesnt take in colors from the rainbow like black and other colors
black  black absorbs heat therefore it would make the dog house warmer than all of the other colors  this can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53  deg  c and the white only got up to 42  deg  c  black was the warmest
light gray  light gray would be best because it wouldnt be not to hot and not to cold 
dark gray  dark gray because it wouldnt be to hot and it wouldnt be to cold 
black  black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
light gray  the dog house color should be light gray because in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest color was white i chose light gray because you dont want the dog to be to cold in the dog house because in thelid experiment the coldest lid was the white lid and the average temperature for that lid was 42  deg  so i though is stead of having the dog house that cold why not have it light gray because the average temperature for the light gray lid turned out to be 45  deg 
white  it should be white because in the experiment  the white lid had the lowest air tempeture  you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer 
white  the color white would be good for the doghouse becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot  in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house 
white  i chose white because the white was the coolest in all 4 trials  the white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keeping it cool  on hot days the dog would stay cool 
white  if they pick white then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the darker colors like black and gray take in more heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in less heat and energy so therefor brandi and jerry should pick a dark color
light gray  if you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp  of the inside of the doghouse it would keep it warm inside if it was cold outside 
black  it might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color 
white  white paint would make the dog house cooler because white paint reflects light 
light gray  i chose light gray because that way the doghouse could stay cool and the dog wouldnt be too hot  black was an average of 53  and light gray was 45  so its a just right roof 
black  black absorbs more heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog will be very warm insidebut durning the hot summer ddays the dog probly wont use it so black would be the best option
white  white can reflect more heat then black because black absorbs more heat
white  white would be the best color for the dog house because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41  deg  c  light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44  deg  c  dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48  deg  c  and black had the hottest temperature of 54  deg  c 
white  the color white would be a good color for dog house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2  deg  in side the jar thats only went up 18  deg 
light gray  the color light gray will heat the dog house but it wont over heat it and it will not under heat it either 
black  blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase it will make it warmer for the dog to like in 
light gray  i would chose light gray because on a cold day  any heat you be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day  the gray wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot 
black  it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
black  dark grey keeps a consistant heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold seasons  this will keep a dog more comfortable 
dark gray  they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer  if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer   this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer  the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48  deg   the black kept it at 53  deg   the light gray kept it at 45  deg   and the white kept it at 42  deg   thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot  if they used the white the dog house would be too cold  the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog 
white  the color white would effect the dog house by making it cooler inside 
light gray  that color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44  deg  46  deg  c  that would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out 
white  the color white might affect the doghouse because since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would the dark color would not only absorb the light but would also create heat energy from the results in the experiment white was the color that i had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get near as hot as all the others also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog stays cool 
white  it would not affect the doghouse to much because it absorbs less heat then the other colors and that allows the doghouse to not get to hot 
dark gray  dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48  deg  c and black averaged at 53  deg  c 
white  white has less energy absorbed so it will cool down better than black would 
white  they should paint the dog house white because its is alight color and attracts less heat the black lid got the highest tempature showing they should not use black pain because it attracts heat
white  this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data  brandi and jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compared to the black to white lid  the black lid was 11  deg  c more hot than the white lid 
white  white would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors  this means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot  in the scenario  the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42  deg  c and the temperatures of the black  dark gray and light gray lids were 53  deg  c  48  deg  c and 45  deg  c  this information shows that the white lid had a lower temperature than the other three lids 
white  if the dog house was white the inside would be cooler then the rest of the colors  in the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black 
white  i would paint it white  that way  showing from the table  the tempurature wouldnt get so hot 
light gray  the color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse  during the experiment  light grey had an average of 48  deg  c  compared to black whos average was 53  deg  c and white whos was 42  deg  c  light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse 
white  so it dosent get hot in the house
white  the dog house will remain cooler in the summer  the white lid only had an average of 42  deg  c in the jar  while the black lid had an average of 53  deg  c in the jar 
dark gray  this color would keep the doghouse warmer during the winter and hotter during the summer  therefore  this would be a good paint color for the doghouse  i know this because in the experiment they did  the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar was around 45  deg   while the darkest colored lid was hotter  and the lightest was cooler 
white  because the lighter the doghouse is the cooler it is in the sun 
white  if brandi and jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse  then itll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside  rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer 
white  white will attract a less amount of heat to the doghouse  it is the best paint color because it will provide shelter for the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment 
white  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects light 
dark gray  i choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot  the results showed that the highest temputure was 48  deg  c and the lowerest was 48  deg  c 
light gray  i would chose light gray because from all the colors it isnt the least amount of air temperature and it isnt the greatest  so  i believe that its just right for the dog because it wont suf ficate or it wont have to much  the first trial for the light greyt was 4 4  deg  c and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45  deg  c and the third trial it also went up by one 46  deg  c  this makes the house very predictable about what the temperature is going to be 
white  a white doghouse would make the inside of that doghouse cooler in the summer  but it wouldnt make it as warm in the winter  since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid 
dark gray  this color will make the temperature in the dog house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat  in the experiment the dark gray got up to 48  deg  c 
black  black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got in the 40s 
black  black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most  black  based on the experiment  was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids  for example  in trial 1  black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius  light gray had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius  evidently  black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors 
white  white becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke 
light gray  light gray is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse cool on a hot day but it will keep some heat on cooler days 
black  this color will make the doghouse absorb more light  because it is black  heat will absorb on this faster then dark gray  light gray  or white 
white  if they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar was 42  deg  c for a white lid and 53  deg  c for a black lid 
light gray  i chose light grey because it will still attract heat and absorb some but not a ton  this way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun  choosing alight color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out  it will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey 
white  the white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the dog house unlike black and the darker colors that abosorb  the heat and then so warm the doghouse and there by increasing the tem  deg 
white  white because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse be cooler
white  it will make it cooler in there  so its not burning hot in the summer
black  if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color 
white  brandi and jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun  white would be best because it will absorb the least energy  keeping the temp down  in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53  while the white color was 42  and 11  deg  difference 
light gray  light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold  at black the temperature was 53  deg  c and at white the temperature was 42  deg  c  but at light gray it was 45  deg  c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold 
white  brandi and jerry should use the color white for the dog house because brighter colors reflect light to keep the dor cool  unless  it is the winter time and you want to keep the dog warm a darker color would be better 
white  i chose white for the color of paint for the dog house  white might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler during the day  when the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53  deg  c  when the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42  deg  c  this is a difference of 11  deg  c  white is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse because it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day 
white  the experiment shows that if the color is white  the less hot the object gets  so if brandi and jerry paint it white the dog would not be as hot if it was black 
light gray  this color should make the doghouse a nice cool temperature cosistantly  i say this because in the data table light gr ays average temp  was 45  deg  
black  i think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it  because black got the highest average of 53 c  deg 
white  its not to dark
white  white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was  the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh 
dark gray  i chose the color dark gray because when it is cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold  but when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool 
white  white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42  deg  c  while black  on average  made the jar the hottest at 53  deg  c  so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black  dark gray  or light gray 
white  if your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42  deg  c while the black lid kept the temperature to 53  deg  c
white  if the color of the doghouse was white then i think the dog that lives there will want to go in the doghouse more often because its not going to be really hot  its going to be cool 
light gray  light gray  because the color is not that dark  but not that light ether  for the summer it wont be that hot  and in the winter it wont be that cold ether  also the tempetures of the data came out that the gray color is right in the middle  average  of the experiment 
white  this way the doghouse will stay cool since the jar with the white lid had the average temperature or 42  deg  c 
dark gray  the greater the increase in the air temperature in the glass jar  because darker colors absorb more energy 
black  it would make it warmer for the dog so it would be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold  in the experiment the results show that the darker the color  the warmer it is inside 
light gray  light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse  one reason i chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse  the dog could overheat  also  the opposite is true as well  if you had a white doghouse  it may make the dog very cold  the black lid had an average of 53  deg  c  and the white lid had an average of 42  deg  c  this makes a greypainted doghouse the best choice 
black  i think that black she psint the doghouse because it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re 
white  the test proves white dosent get as hot as other colors
white  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as does darker colors  for example  in the air temprature expeirament  they put a dark colord lid over ajar  with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius  after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c  but when they put the lighter coverd lid over the jar  at a starting point of 24c  after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c  so the best choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog 
dark gray  the dark gray color for a doghouse might be best to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives  but not overly heated in the summer  in the experiment  the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48  deg   a black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog  in the investigation  the air temperature of black was at 53  deg   the light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog  the air temperatures of the light gray was 45  deg  and of the white was 42  deg   this is why i would choose the dark gray paint for a doghouse 
white  as shown in brandi and jerrys experiment  white absorbs less light than the other colors  if the doghouse is painted white  than the air temperature will be less inside of the doghouse  so the dog will be cooler inside of the doghouse 
white  in the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest  the black was the hottest  then came the dark gray  than light grey  then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog 
white  it will make it cooler inside because the white coloer will deflect light from the house
white  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
black  be geos once you go black u never go back
white  they should choose white because they dont want their dog to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool on the inside 
light gray  light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot but not to cold
white  white is the best color to use for the doghouse  this is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and therefore it wont be as hot insdie the house  with the white colored jar lid  the average tempurature is 42  deg  c  the averages for the light gray  dark gray and black lids were 45  deg  c  48  deg  c and 53  deg  c  this shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and more comfortable for the dog 
white  it is the brightest color in this selection and the darker the color  the more energy it will absorb  the doghouse will usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the suns solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse  evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average column of the data table  by doing so  you can see that white had the lowest average temperature at 42  deg  c  while the black had an average temperature of 53  deg  c  dark and light gray were also above whites average  making white the best suited color for the doghouse 
light gray  it will make it cool on warm and sunny days but on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and cold depending on the day
white  in the summer the doghouse would not be to warm and not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black 
black  using the results from the experiment the best color for the doghouse if you were looking for the doghouse to be warm would be black because in the experiment it shows that black heats up the most in the same amunt of time 
black  i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scores 
dark gray  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray  because then inside of the dog house it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog  if they painted the house black  it would be too hot  the average temperature was 53  deg  c and the dark gray average temperature was 48  deg  c  light gray and white would make the inside of the doghouse too cold  because those temperatures averaged at 45  deg  c and 4 2  deg  c  therefore  dark grey is just right 
white  i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black 
white  in the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat  and you do not want more heat in youre dogs house  and you dont want youre dog to overheat so i picked white so it stays cool during the summer 
white  i say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment  it shows that darker colors absorbs more energy then any other colors  white would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because its alight color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in its house 
light gray  if you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just not as much  light gray would be just in the middle of all of them 
white  i think white might be the best color for the dog house because when its sunny out the temperature inside the dog house will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white is cooler proving that it absorbes less heat 
white  is because on a hot day it wont be as hot in the doghouse if you use white if you use black the dog would be to hot 
black  it will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy 
dark gray  this color would make the doghouse warm but not too warm and it wont be cold inside either 
light gray  i chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house wont be too hot or too cold  the light gray rose 21  deg  c in ten minutes where as the black rose 29  deg  c and that means that when its hot outside the tempature in the dog house will be hot and uncomfortable 
white  the inside of the doghouse would be cooler with the color white and with black it would be hotter
black  black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy 
white  having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldnt gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house  according to a experiment on lid color vs  air temperature inside glass jar  a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar  while a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees 
dark gray  i choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse because the white color would be good for summer  but then during the winter the dog would get too cold  the black color would be good for winter  but then during summer the dog would get too hot  the light gray color would be good for summer  spring and winter  but not for fall  the dark gray would be good for summer  fall and winter  and the dog would probably spend most of hisher time outside during spring  i would paint the doghouse dark gray 
light gray  light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside  the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outside  in the experiment light gray had the averge of 45  deg  c while white had 42  deg  c and the black had an avergae of 53  deg  c  this shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight  the black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm 
light gray  this color might affect the doghouse by making the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog a comfortable temperature for the dog 
black  trial 1  54   trial 2  52   trial 3  54   trial 4  53   this color would keep keep it warm when it needs to be warm  and keep it cool when it needs to be cool 
white  that color might affect the doghouse  because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse 
light gray  i choose light gray because in the winter gray is kinda dark it will be warm  and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray 
black  the color black absorbs more light  so the doghouse will be warmer 
dark gray  the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold 
black  black would affect the air temperature in the dog house  in the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53  deg  c  this color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer  on hot days  the black color would attract heat  which would be a health issue for the dog 
light gray  light gray would be a good color because if you used black then that would attract energy from the sun causing the sun to hitthe dog house and the dog will get to hot  so if we use light it will slightly attract some energy from the sun because the color is a mixture between black and white making the dog the right temerature 
light gray  it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a little
black  this color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors  dark grays average temperature was 48 degrees celcius  light grays average temperature was 45 degrees celcius  and whites average temperature was 42 degrees celcius 
light gray  if you use alight gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
white  it might affect it by the  deg  c level in the dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it ah otter tempature 
dark gray  the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter  in the results of the lab  the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment  the dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house 
black  how the color might affect the doghouse is by the temperature of the inside of the doghouse  with the proven fact by the experiment that darker colors absorb more heat  painting the doghouse the color black will increase the temperature of inside the doghouse  in the experiment  brandi and jerry got the results that the color black  out of all the colors  had the hottest temperature of the inside of the glass jar 
dark gray  it makes the house pretty hot so the dog wont get cold but its not so hot that the dog will get too warm
light gray  becasue it isnt too dark and it isnt too light  its just right for the dogs eyesight 
dark gray  that effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold 
black  if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data 
dark gray  i think that a dark gray would be the best color to paint the dog house  sense dark colors attract solar heat   but it all depends on where the dog house will be located   for example   if your somewhere where its normally hot outside   you should paint the house white or light gray  but if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside   paint it dark gray or black 
black  its my favorite color
light gray  i think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold 
white  if you paint the dog house white  it will stay nice and cool and wont get too hot because the data showed that when the lid was white  the average temperature  42  deg  c  was colder than the others  when the lid was black the average temperature was highest  53  deg  c  which is 11  deg  more than the white lids average 
white  ti make ti litere
white  i think they should paint the dog house white because in the summer it will keep the doghouse cooler inside and keep the dog from getting to hot 
light gray  light gray might not affect the dog house because in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark  the dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right 
white  it will affect the doghouse because i wont be as hot inside if its painted white but if its painted black or another color it will be hotter inside 
white  white would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown 
white  white will make the dog house as cool as possible
white  having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experiment which was 42  deg  c average  and since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best  the other colors averages were black 53  deg  c dark gray48  deg  c and light gray 45  deg  c which are to hot for a dog to be living in 
white  this is the best possible paint color for doghouse for the summer  but for the winter it would be black 
white  whtie is the best color to paint the dog house because  in brandi and jerrys experiment the darker lids had a higher tempature  black had a ending tempature average of 53  deg  c and the white lid had a ending tempature average of 42  deg  c  therefor  white would be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog 
white  the white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days 
white  less solor energy less hot the dogs house will be
black  because its average is very high  and it could do something to it 
black  darker colors attract and absorb more light so if you paint the doghouse black then the suns rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer 
light gray  it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle 
white  the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compared to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
black  i chose black because the average inside temperature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius  so then the dog house would be warmer for the dog 
black  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people dont wear black on a hot day  i can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53  deg  and that was the highest temperature there was this is why i think brandi and jerry should use black for there dog house 
white  it would make it cooler than the other colors  white ended up about 42  deg  c while black was about 53  deg  c 
white  white will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42  deg   while light gray was 45  deg   dark gray was 48  deg   and black was 53  deg  
black  because dogs are colored blind and if the dog house is painted black then the dog wouldnt be able to see it 
white  white will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse  in the experiment white had an average of 42  deg  c while the other colors had higher temperature averages 
black  the black paint would absorb heat  that would keep the doghouse warm  the results showed that the jar with the black lid was th warmest after 10 minues 
dark gray  i how not mack the dog house black it will be to hot
white  it will make the air cooler becuase its aver age was 42  it started at 24 so it only went up by 18 and black went up by 29 because black ended at 53 
dark gray  dark gray would be better because you dont want the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont want it to be to warm for the dog 
white  white is a very light color  but with black it attracts the sun  so inside this doghouse when black  it can get hot  but with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53  deg  c as the black had  the white had a average of 42  deg  c which is not hot compared to 53  deg  c 
black  the color affects the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse if the color is darker it will be hoter if the color is lighter it will he colder and so on  and because the doghouse will probaly be outside i chose black so that it is warmer
light gray  it wont be as hot inside of the doghouse  making it more comfortable for the dog in the hotter months  but it will still be warm enough that the dog will be comfortable in the colder months 
light gray  the color might affect the doghouse because light gray will not make it too hot or too cold  the temperature will be in the middle 
black  this color will help keep the insideof the doghouse warmer  the black colored lid is 9  deg  warmer than the white col ored lid 
light gray  after being exposed to heat  white was the coolest with 42  deg  c  followed by light gray with 45  deg  c  dark gray  and then black  by using light grey  the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer  unlike black  and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter  unlike white 
black  well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outside  so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature  on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees  12 degree difference
white  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
white  i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  c whereas the light grey had an average of 45  deg  c  the dark grey had an average of 48  deg  c and the black had an average of 53  deg  c 
black  if they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color  in the experiment the black lids average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold 
white  the color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees  that makes black 9 degrees hotter then white 
white  whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the winter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in the summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color white especailly in the heat 
black  becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot 
white  white would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house  it would stay at a temperature of about 42  deg  c  this color doesnt attract heat like black or dark colors do  so i think this would be the best choice 
light gray  i have know idea
white  white will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors  this is because  the average air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42  deg  c  the light grey lid was 45  deg  c  the dark grey lid was 48  deg  c  and the balck lid was 53  deg  c  the difference between the darkest  black  lid and the white lid was 11  deg  c 
white  white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
black  black would affest the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make the dog house very hot on the inside 
white  it will make it cooler for the dog and the dog wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
white  the white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat 
black  they should do the dog house black because the aveerage in the expierament was 53  deg  and that is around the temepat ure that a dog would wanna stay in while its sleeping  also beacuase when its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps 
dark gray  i picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him  then if its white it will just be too cool for him  so i that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom
light gray  the best color for brandi and jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray  this is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat  black  had an average temperature of 53  deg  c and the coolest  white  had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  the light grey lid had an average temperature of 45  deg  c  a medium between the two  which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer 
dark gray  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the winter but not so hot in the summer
white  it will be better because the whiter the color the better beacause it will not absorb that much enrgy 
white  this color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light  while as the color black or darker colors absorb light  so with the choice of white  the doghouse would not heat up as much as it would if brandi and jerry were to use a darker color 
black  this color will keep the inside of the doghouse warmer  dark colors absorb more heat energy  in the experiment with the jar  the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color
black  this color might affect the dog house because black absorbs the most energy that is given  it is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53  deg  c
light gray  i chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter 
black  using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter  in the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest  this would help the dog stay warmer in the winter  it would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate 
light gray  the light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures  but will also absorb enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semiwarm environment  while the black lid color in the experiment created an average jarair temperature of 53  deg   that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment  however  if we look at the white lid  it had an average temperature of 42  deg   that temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler  however  the light gray lid had an average of 45  deg  in the trials  its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balanced environmetn for the dog to live in 
black  black would make the doghouse warm inside  in the experiment  the average temperature for black jars was 53  deg  c
white  the color white would affect the doghouse because the tempuature will be cooler 
light gray  it would keep the dog house at a good temperature not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold 
light gray  it will put some heat in but will also keep it cool in the day
white  white because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun in the experiment brandi and jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb  so thats why white is the best color to choose to make anew doghouse because it doesnt absorb that much energy from the sun 
black  black  darker  colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source  lamp  and keep it heated up inside the dog house  like the air temperature experiment  the black lid color  had 54  deg  c while the white lid color had a 42  deg  c  proving that the darker the color there is  the more heat is absorbed  keeping it more warm 
dark gray  dark grey would be the best color for them to make the dog house because the air temperature wouldnt be too hot or too cold for the dog  also the temperature stayed the same for all the trials which means that it wont change no matter how hot the weather may be 
dark gray  i would choose to paint the doghouse dark gray because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldnt make the doghouse too warm or cold  the data supports this because the jar with the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars  when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar  making it to cold 
white  it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there  in the experamint white had the lowest temputure
dark gray  not a lot just a agents the sun
white  it will make it warm inside the doghouse because the light did not penetrate it alot  so the thermometer did not go as high
dark gray  it will keep it a nice temperature not too warm and not too cold
white  it wont be as hot for the dog 
white  i think white because it would keep the most heat out
black  the color black would effect the doghouse because the sun is attracted to the color black also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture 
dark gray  this color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble  the average temperature of the dark gray lid was 48  deg  c  5  deg  c cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid  which was the black lid  and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature 
white  the dog house should be white because the color white  deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler  if the dog house was painted black  it would absorb more heat waves and then the dog house would get hotter 
light gray  it will make the dog house warmer in the winter but will not make it too warm in the summer 
white  paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot  because black attracts too much heat  paint the doghouse black if you live somewhere cold because the heat cant affect that 
white  white might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white  in the experiment  showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees c  when black increased by 30 or so degrees c 
white  i picked the white color because the affect of white color paint makes the temperature for the dog house to be alot more cooler so if the dog house is white the dogs temperature will be alot more cooler than the other colors their is
black  the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog  and calculate and record the average air temperature for each lid color 
black  i chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer  if they paint the dog house white  the light will just reflect off  butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm  i know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53  deg  c  but the average temperature with the white lid was 42  deg  c  so black would be the best color for the dog house 
black  this would make the doghouse very hot and uncomfortable because  as shown in the expirament  black attracts heat bringing more thermal energy to the dog house than other colors such as white 
white  the color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53  deg  c  the dark gray had an average temperature of 48  deg  c  and the light gray had an average temperature of 45  deg  c  finally  the white had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  so the black jar had the highest temperature  darkest color  and the white had the lowest temperature  brightest color   so inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
black  the color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of thes four colors 
white  it should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energyheat 
black  the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
white  white because it will not tack or exorb the heat 
black  it might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery 
black  this color paint  black  will attract more he at to the inside of the dog house  we know this because the averge of heat in side the jar on bradi and jerry exsperiment was 54  deg  c for black paint and 42  deg  c for the white paint  so you can see that if you were wanting to keep the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to paint it black 
black  the color black might affect the inside of the doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase the temp of the house inside
black  it will make the temperature inside of the doghouse hotter 
white  painting the doghouse white will make it so that the temperature inside will be cooler  because as tests show  white compared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius 
white  the white color may affect the dog house by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun 
white  white reflect the light  when you use white color temperature will lower than when you use dark color  in the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42  deg  c but when you use black the temperature was 53  deg  c  when you use white color temperature was 9  deg  c lower than when you use dark color 
light gray  in the test results the white at the average of 42  deg  c was the coolest while black at the average of 53  deg  c was the hottest  while light gray is averiging 45  deg  c  it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog 
dark gray  during each trial it stayed 48  deg  c which i snt to hot or cold  it might affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold outside he wont freeze because the color is trying to attract some kind of heat  for when its hot it would attract some sunlight though but not as much as black  so its fairly compfortable for a dog 
black  black would be the best color to use so that the dog will stay warm  the average tempature using black was 53 25  deg  c
black  painting the doghouse black will result in the temperature inside to be higher  the darker the color is on the outside will absorb more heat energy into the doghouse  this will help because it will keep the dog warmer 
black  it would affect the doghouse because the color black is going to make the doghouse hotter 
light gray  this color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature  i chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature cold  but not freezing 
black  the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for the dog house  from the expirement it shows when they put the dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar 
black  will absord more energy
white  it would be the best because it would keep the dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
white  the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
white  white will keep the doghouse cooler  because it will be only 42  deg  c inside  then if brandi and jerry were to use black it would be 54  deg  c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light  and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse 
light gray  light gray because it wouldnt be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold  becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45  deg  and that in perfect tempature
light gray  i chose the light gray because on average it was 45  deg  c  so it wouldnt be too hot o too cold for the dog 
white  the lighter the color is  the more light energy it reflects  if most of the light energy is reflected  the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever youre painting 
white  the color of the dog house affected the temperature inside 
white  i would chose white  because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot  id want it to be as cold as i could get it  for black the average was the warmest with 53  deg  c  for dark gray it was in the middle with 48  deg  c  for light gray it was also in the middle with 45  deg  c  and white was the coldest wtih 42  deg  c  the white paint will keep the doghouse less insulated  and more open  it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42  deg  c isnt cold or hot its in the middle 
white  white would be the best color  this is because on average it had the lowest tempature inside  so it asorbed or blocked the most heat  it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees
black  it would increase the temerature more than any colors selected 
black  black
white  i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the average and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the color that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it reflects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre light grey and white 
white  it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
white  because white is the the color that regects all light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat
light gray  the lighter the color of the doghouse  the cooler the temperature is inside  and the darker the color of the dog house  the warmer it is inside  because when the lid color was black  the aver age temperature was 53  deg  c  but when the lid color was white  the aver age temperature was 42  deg  c  which had a difference of 11  deg  
black  because black is a dark color and it will atr ackt te sun  so then the tempeture is going to change
light gray  they dont want it to be too cold  but not too hot either  alight gray dog house wont be too cold for the dog  but also not too hot because itll just warm the dog house up 11  deg  c  that isnt too much  so the dog wont suffocate  but it wont freeze to death either 
white  assuming that you want to keep the doghouse cool  i would choose to paint it white because it reflects the least amount of light 
black  the average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53  deg  c  with a dark gray lid  the average temperature was 48  deg  c  with alight gray lid  the average temperature was 45  deg  c  with a white lid  the average temperature was 42  deg  c  the starting temperature was 24  deg  c  so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29  deg  c  the average temperature for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11  deg  warmer than the white lid  therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm  and also to keep the dog warm in cold temperatures  black would be the best color  because it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar 
light gray  i believe that the light gray color would be optimal for the doghouse  it would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level  not too hot or cold  the average temperature of the jar with the light gray lid after ten minutes was 45  deg  c 
light gray  light gray will affect the doghouse because  based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an average of 45  deg   this will help because during the summer when it is hot  it will keep the doghouse cooler  but  it will also help during the winter and keep the dog house warmer 
light gray  this color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black  the dog would get really hot because the darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter  if you use white then it doesnt get as much energy so the dog may get cold because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract  light gray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much 
white  the color white may affect the doghouse in abetter way than the other three colors because according to the data table the lid color black  dark gray  light gray  all had higher air temperatures  the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar  therefore  white would be abetter color for the doghouse because the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the other three colors 
black  the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house 
white  this would affect the dog house because in the summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
white  the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
white  white will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps  when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius  keeping the doghouse nice and cold  
white  i think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot the black colors average is 53 and the white colors average is 42 
black  becouse the dog house would look filthy
black  black will affect the dog house and make it hotter  because black atracts the sun
dark gray  dark grey because their all 48in all different procdures
dark gray  the best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray  because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside  dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature  so the temperature will keep the dog warm  but not too hot 
light gray  light gray because it didnt heat up that much  but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
white  the color should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out 
white  using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun  refurring back to the hot lamp experiment  we know that white absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials  the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42  deg  after 10 minutes  that is only 18  deg  c more than the temperature it started at  24  deg  c   this is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house 
black  the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray  or white because darker colors absorb more energy  this is supported by the data of the experiment hot lamp  the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis  the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis  the average temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 minutes was 45 degrees celsuis  and the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis  this data shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the dog house 
dark gray  the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other  plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
black  it will make the dog house really hot 
black  by using black for the color of the dog house  the inside of the house will be warmer than the other colors  because darker colors absorb more heat  according to brandi and jerrys chart it is true  because after 10 minutes the black lit had the warmest air inside the jar 
dark gray  it will keep same temp  and will be too hot nor cold
black  it will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable 
white  the color will affect the dog house because it will make it alot cooler in the dog house when the sun is out and it will look better  
white  they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light 
white  white paint color because that way the dog wont be hot instead it would be cool
black  it wil heat the dog house up more than the other colors 
light gray  eeee
black  if the doghouse is black  it will absorb more energy then the other colors  this is apparent in the test  where the starting temperature for the glass jar was 24  deg  c  and the black jar went up to 53  deg  c  while the white jar only went up to 42  deg  c 
light gray  it will make it slighty cooler than hot  it will affect the dog house as making the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot on hot days 
white  that color would allow the doghouse to be cooler and not so hot and stuffy 
white  white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids 
light gray  the color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature  not too cold or too hot  because the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the cooler it gets  according too the data in which i got the information 
white  the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy 
black  if you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog  inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in  as it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture 
white  if the dog house was painted black and was exposed to the sun for to long it would get to ht now if it was painted white the house wont get to hot
dark gray  dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog 
light gray  the light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm  during the winter the dog wont freeze and during the summer it wont sweat a lot 
dark gray  the color will affect the dog house by keeping it warm in winter and not so hot in summer 
white  white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
white  a white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table  the white colors average temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when its hot 
white  white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer  cause darker colors attract heat
light gray  this color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm  also  when the weather is cold outside the doghouse will be warm but aslo a bit cool  i know this because when the light gray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average and stayed cool  however the lid was also a bit warm  the lowest temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44  deg  c while the highest was 46  deg  c which  if this is the same with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature 
white  it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them 
black  the darker the color  the warmer it will be inside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy 
light gray  the best color to paint a doghouse would be light gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than black by 8  deg  and it was 3  deg  hotter than white which would allow the dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
black  the inside of the doghouse would be much warmer inside the doghouse then the other colors  the black attracts more heat 
white  white paint would be best because it would keep the interior of the dog house cool  the white lid had an average of 42  deg  c while the black lid got up to 53  deg  c  unless you want your dog to be too hot in his or her doghouse  i suggest you paint it white  also  white looks much better on houses than black  dark grey  or light grey 
dark gray  the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
light gray  using alight gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable  i would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45  deg  c inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days 
black  they should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53  deg  c  which was 5  deg  c higher than the second warmest roof color of dark gray and 11  deg  c higher than the coldest roof color  white 
dark gray  it wont be too hot or too cold 
dark gray  dark gray
dark gray  the white paint would reflect all of the light rays  therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat  the black lid had an average of 53  deg  c air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes  but the white lid had and average of 42  deg  c air temperature inside the jar  after 10 minutes  this is a difference of 11  deg  c  the white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other color of paint 
white  the color white will affect the dog house  by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much heat  keeping the dog house cooler  the average temperature for the whute lip was 42  the coolest temperater  and the average for black was 53  the highest  the lower the number the cooler it is  white would be the best choice for the doghouse 
black  black is the best color because it increases the air temperature so the dog wont be cold 
light gray  using light gray would keep the tempurature at an even or equal rate  if it was cold  it wouldnt keep it as warm  but not super cold either  if it was hot outside  the dog house would keeps orta cool  but not extremely hot either  the average of black is a high at 53 degrees  which is super hot  then white would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees 
white  the white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but wont be too hot in the summer  the average temperture of the white lid was 42  deg  c  this way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color 
light gray  light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery  making the inside warm for the dog  since the color doesnt absorb all of the energy  the doghouse will still be cool compared to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in  light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy 
black  white because it was less heat in 10min  also the temputers only got to around 40 45  deg 
light gray  light gray because it would keep the dog house warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature  the temperature stays to an average of 45  deg  c 
white  white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42  deg  c it will keep the dog comfortable 
black  in the summer it can make the inside of the dog house hot 
white  dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
white  brandi and jerry should design a doghouse with the color white  because the white lids average air temperature in the jar was only 42  deg  c  the lowest temperature of all the lids  this would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light  to keep the dog cooler  as you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42  deg  c as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53  deg  c  this is an increase in 11  deg  c a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid  and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within the doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all other paint colors tested 
white  the color will reflect most of the heat and the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler  in the experament  the temperature of the jar with the white lid only was raised an average of 16  deg  c 
white  by painting the doghouse white  the temperature in the doghouse will not be that high  according to the experiment  using a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low  so by painting the doghouse white  the temperature in the doghouse will stay low 
dark gray  this color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot 
white  the best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both brandi and jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this i mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42  deg  c which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either 
light gray  black holds heat in so it would be to hot and white hardly holds any heat so light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling 
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it wont absorb as much heatenergy as the darker colors  in the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest  53  deg  c   while the light gray lid only reached 45  deg  c  it will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors 
light gray  light gray is a good color because it will keep the inside of the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it warm when the sun hits the god house it will not make it really hot as it would if it were black or dark gray 
black  i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter    in the expiriment it showed that black is hotter 
white  it wont effect it at all becuase white dont asorb to much energy and wont cuase any heat like black will
black  if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm 
white  the paint color that they should use is white  this is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42  deg   while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45  48  and 53  deg   this shows that the white lid was 11  deg  degrees color on average than the black lid  therefore  the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in the white house  wheras he could become too hot in the black one 
light gray  it wont make the dog hot or cold because its in between the highest tempature would be to hot because its 54  deg  and the lowest would be to cold which is 41  deg  and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold 
black  if the dog house had a black roof  it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather  for example  in the winter time or when it is cold out  the black roof keeps all of the dogs body heat in the house  instead of wasting it  and in the summer  when its hot  hell be outside playing  and his doghouse temperature wont matter that much 
black  it would make the doghouse warmer 
light gray  the doghouse would not get too hot
light gray  you dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside  it will be about 45  deg  c
white  white will keep the dog cool in the summer  so the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog in the winter it will just be a normal temperature 
white  white because it holds the least amount of he at 
light gray  well  i pick light gray because i wouldnt want too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color  most dogs goes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax 
light gray  light gray will be the best color to paint for the dog house  because it wouldnt attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would 
dark gray  the light grey color of the dog house would make it nuetral inside because it stayed the same throughout each experiment 
black  the sun absorbs more energy in the color  making the inside of the doghouse hot amp warm 
dark gray  i think it should be dark gray becuase when its summer the color will absorb heat so he cant say nice and warm and cool at the same time  
black  if they painted the doghouse black  then it will be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb  example the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar 
white  the best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
black  a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold  a white dog house will make it colder than all of the other colors 
white  the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside  the lighter the color is it will not be as not inside 
white  the color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot  for example  when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 42  deg  c but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53  deg  c 
white  white will  attract less heat  i say this because  it had the lowest average of 42  deg  thats 1  deg  less than gray  6  deg  less that dark grey  and 11  deg  less than black 
light gray  well if the color is to dark then the doghouse would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
black  i think black would be the best for the color of a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the darkest one
dark gray  brandi and jerry should pant their doghouse dark gray  i think they should paint the doghouse dark gray because in the experiment hot lamp the average of the averages in that experiment was 57  and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid 
white  because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical 
white  the color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house  in the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53c
black  the color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer  the black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the doghouse warm at night 
white  white would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot 
black  the color black would increase air temperature inside the doghouse  this is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53  deg  c and when the lid color was white the air temperature inside was only an average of 42  deg  c  so this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11  deg  c 
black  in the expirement  the jar with the black lid was on average 53  deg  c after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets  the dark grey lid was only 48  deg  c  5  deg  c less than that of the black lid  the jar with a white lid was only 42  deg  c  11  deg  c less than the jar with the black lid  to warm up the dog house by just the sunlight brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the temperature within the dog house  compared to the results with the jars  the black paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement  the black lid warmed up the jar 11  deg  c more than the jar with the white lid 
white  i would choose white because  white does not absorb a lot of light so there for  when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse  i choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the black lid it was 53  that is an 11  deg  c difference between the two colors  so for a dog house i highly considered it being white 
light gray  the light gray will make the dogs house not too cold and not too hot for the dog  the average tempature would probably be around 4050  deg  because the light gray lid on the jar had an average 45  deg  c but a dog house is a different size from ajar so the tempa ture will vary a little 
white  the best color for the dog house is white  this is because acording to brandies and jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house  for the black dog house the average temperature would be 53  deg  c for the dark grey dog house the average temperature would be 48  deg  c for the light grey dog house the teperature would be 45  deg  c and the white dog house would have a temerature 42  deg  c  acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white 
white  if the dark the color the hotter it gets why not choose white to keep the dog nice and cool in some ways 
white  white is the best color for the dog house because darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out  but white reflects all of that heat energy
dark gray  the reason that i selected dark gray as the optimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors  dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature  this tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it  and cooler then black in the summer  because it is a lighter shade than black  this will occur from the dark gray paint  because in the experiment  the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53  deg   the use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42  deg   the use of alight gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45  deg   and the use of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48  deg   this shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature  and ideal for a doghouse  because its tempurature was 6  deg  hotter than the coolest tempurat ure  and 5  deg  cooler then the hottest tempurature  making dark gray medium in tempurature  and optimal for a dog house 
dark gray  that color  dark gray  might affect the dog house by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color  but not as dark black  so it wont absorb so munch heat 
white  the best paint color for the dog house is white because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other color so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house  acording to the air temperature black average was 53 c  deg  dark gray average 48 c  deg  light gray average 45 c  deg  and the white average 42 c  deg 
white  i picked white because it will make the dog house colder even when the sun hits it
white  i would choose to paint the dog house white  the reason that i would paint the dog house white is because the inside of the dog house would then be cooler  rather than if you were painting it black  the average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42  deg  c rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53  deg  c  this has an overwhelming difference of 11  deg  c after just 10 minutes
black  this color  black  will help the dog house staybecome warmer  since the dog house is outside  and for the most part its pretty cold outside  the dog house should be black  so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm  black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better  after the 10 minutes  in the experiment  black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees celcius  after the 10 minutes  in the experiment  white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees celcius  so this proves that the darker the color  the more energy it will absorb  making the object warmer 
black  the color will keep the dog house cooler in the hot sumer
dark gray  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house 
white  i pick this color because its so bright 
dark gray  the color wuld keep the dog house at a event empature but it wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system  the jar had a lid so it left in heat  but a dog house would let the heat out so the dog house is a open system 
white  the tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside  because in the experiment  the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used  so it would be more reasonable to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse 
light gray  it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool because it is alight gray
black  if they choose to paint the dog house black  it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy  in the investigation  the average temperature for the black lid was 53  deg  c versus the white which had an average of 42  deg  c  therefore  if brandi and jerry paint the dog house black  it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors 
light gray  the best paint color for the dog house would be light grey  this because the light grey would keep the dog house not as hot during like the summer  and warm enough during the winter  from bra ndi and jerrys previous experiment  you can see with darker colors on the lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside  with the light grey it would be not to hot or cold  another choice would be the white but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter  so light grey is the best choice 
white  it asorb less heat
black  the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off  so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 minutes after the light turned off 
light gray  light gray would be the best color for the doghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent  the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45  deg  c after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white lid  42  deg  c  and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average air temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid  48  deg  c  or the black lid which was 53  deg  c  with the light grey roof  the dog would not get too hot or too cold in its doghouse 
white  it was the lid color that had the coolest temperature  it was 42  deg  c  43  deg  c  41  deg  c  and 42  deg  c 
black  the color black  might affect the inside of the doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the other colors  i think this because in the data from the experiment  the average air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53  deg  c  the dark gray lid colors average air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48  deg  c  the air temperature for light gray was 45  deg  c  and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42  deg  c  overall  the conclusion you could draw from that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors  in the experiment the black lid had a difference in averages from the coldest air temperature  the white lid  by 11  deg  c 
light gray  maybe something else was alredy that color
black  black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs 
light gray  they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog 
white  that color will effect the doghouse because the doghouse will not be hot in the summer it will stay cool in the there 
black  black if you live in a cold place and want the dog house to stay warm 
dark gray  in winter the doghouse will stay warm in the summer the doghouse will stay cool 
black  in the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat 
white  i choose white because if it was black  dark gray  or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hotness 
dark gray  because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house
black  the color might affect the dog house because it is a dark color     
dark gray  i think that brandi and jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature dark grey would be the best because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53  deg  c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an average of 42  deg  c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48  deg  c  the light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45  deg  c the light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3  deg  c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it got colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog 
black  black would be a good because it is a dark color and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog 
white  white
dark gray  dark gray would be the best for the lids to make it sleeping light
light gray  light gray is not too cold but not too hot  remember  most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm  amp so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot  like the black dog house  cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors  if a dog gets too cold in the dog house  provide blankets  food  amp water  for a healthy envoirment  also  if you see its a nice day outside  let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside 
white  if you painted the dog house white  it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does  so if you painted it black  the dog would be really warm 
white  i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot 
light gray  youd probably want alight gray so that in the summer the house is cool  and in the winter its warm
dark gray  it wwould make the dog house a good temperature
light gray  light gray doesnt wont make the dog house  too hot or too cold  the dog house would be both warm and cool down 
dark gray  dark gray is best because the temperature stays the same
white  white has the least temperature on the data table and it is the lightest color  like their hypothesis said darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors  so white is the lightest color there is  so that means that the white doghouse wont absorb any heat like the black  dark gray  and light gray doghouses 
dark gray  i would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be warm inside 
dark gray  cause darker the color more it atracts heat
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light grey  because light grey absorbs more heat than white  but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey  light gray would be perfect  because during the summer  the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot  so the doghouse wouldnt be too warm  during the winter  the light gray would absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the winter  i know this because in the experiment that brandi and jerry did  where they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature  they found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53  deg  c  the average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48  deg  c  the average temperature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45  deg  c  finnaly  the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42  deg  c  this shows that light gray absorbs some heat  but not alot  so light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse 
white  if the color white is used on the dog house  it would reflect the suns light causing the inside of the dog house to be cooler than if it was painted with a darker colored paint 
white  white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm 
dark gray  the dark gray would be better for the dog house because its not to hot but not to cold  the black would be to hot becuse the average was 53  deg  c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light grays average at 45  deg  c and white at 42  deg  c  so in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48  deg  c 
black  how hot it will get
white  i go with white because then the dog wont be as hot or cold in somedays because most of the trials were different 
white  they should paint the dog house white  if the dog house was whiteand it was a sunny day  then the dog would be hot   dogs cant sweat  
black  black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house  the average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color  white  is 42 degrees  though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm rather than cold 
dark gray  it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
white  the darker the coler the hotter the air in the dog house
white  white would be a good color for the dog house because it doesnt absorb as much heat as black  this would make it cooler so the dog wouldnt be too hot
black  if it is cold outside and there is still some sun  the color would absorb the sun  making the dog house a little warmer for the dog to stay in  giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing  brandi and jerry did an experiment where they tested colors  black  dark gray  light gray amp white  and black had an average of 53 degrees c  while comparing to the white which was 42 degrees c  that is 12 degrees apart from the black 
dark gray  it would keep the doghouse warm but not to warm because dark gray is a dark color
white  i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
light gray  the light gray color will keep the room bothe cool and warm at the same time
light gray  black absorbs more heat  therefore it will be too warm in the dog house  white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table  during trial 1 white was 42  deg  while black was 54  deg   so if the roof is white the dog will too cool  therefore the dog house should be light grey  it is a happy medium  on cool days it will still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white  and on hot days it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black 
white  the daog have fur and when it hot the white will reflect the heat from going inside and keep the dog cool in the experiment the white got cool then the others
dark gray  if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse dark gray  then when the dog would be inside the doghouse it would not be hot  but it would not be cold  either  from the investigation for the air temperature  the average of all the averages combined is 47  the closest color to that temperature is dark grey  therefore  the color dark grey is just the right temperature because its not too not  and not too cold  the dog inside the doghouse would be perfect in this temperature 
black  if the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer  the air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it  the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse 
dark gray  dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house because in all the trials the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar to 48  deg  c  the light gray lid change the air in the jar to 44  deg  c in the first trial  45  deg  c in the second trial  and 46  deg  c in the third trial  dark gray would kepp the doghouse the same temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary 
white  if you have a white houes les heat will be at racted to the houes because it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes more heat will be atracted
black  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
light gray  the color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray  would be hotter then light gray  and light gray would be hotter then white  white would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest 
white  white would be the best choice for the dog house because dark colors like black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy and it will be hotter  so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog would be in cooler temp
light gray  well darker colors absorb more heat  making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool  but also warm but not to warm
white  white because  the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42  deg  c  so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white 
black  black will affect the dog house becouse black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
black  becasue darker colors absorve more enrg y 
black  black because dark colors absorb more energy
white  because thee adrker the color of something the more heat is attracted to it 
light gray  its the median tempurature from the experiment  so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather 
light gray  the color will keep the dog warmer in the winter  but wont make the dog house hot in the summer 
dark gray  using the dark gray paint would be best because it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors  the doghouse temperature would be warm  which is good for the winter and most seasons 
black  black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54  deg  c ware as white paint was only 42  deg  c  so there would be an avarge of about 12  deg  c diffence between the white and black paint 
black  the darker the color  the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer  and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest  the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
dark gray  this color will effect the tempeture of the dog house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time  the dark gray color keeps the tempeture the same  and it keeps it nice and cool for the dog 
light gray  black is too dark and it will make the dog de peress and the white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make it dirty soon and depress  it will make the dog hyper and more excited 
dark gray  because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
white  the color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices  the average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42  deg  c  which is 11  deg  c cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53  deg  c  proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice 
black  it will make it absorb more enerrgy 
dark gray  the color dark gray because it would keep the dog house cool for the dog because the average temp  was 48  deg 
white  the white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside  since the temperature was lowest when the white lid was on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse 
white  because it doesnt get as hot at black  dark grey  or light gray  the avrage for the white lid is 42  deg  c  the average for the black is 53  deg  c  the average for the dark grey is 48  deg  c  and the average for the light grey is 45  deg  c so there for white is the best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors
white  the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature  at 42 degrees celsius
white  well dogs like light color so they will use it more often 
white  white might be the best color for the doghouse because of its low heat intake  with the dog having long hair it wouldnt be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would always get hot  so  with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortable in a less hot doghouse 
dark gray  if brandi and jerry made a doghouse  the best color to paint it would be dark gray  dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog wont be cold if it goes inside  but it isnt as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler  it can use the doghouse 
dark gray  the dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray  also if you chose alight gray it could be cold in the winter  so there for dark gray would be the best color 
white  the doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table  lid color vs  air temperature   the glass jar with the white lid was the least affected by light  for example  the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42  deg  c  while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53  deg  c 
white  the color white may affect the dog house because during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun  making the dog house less hot 
white  the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41  deg  c  with the paint color as white the air temperature in the doghouse wont get as hot  with a black lid in the previous experiment the average air temperature was 53  deg  c which is hotter than the white lid by 12  deg  c 
light gray  so it wont get to hot or too cold
white  it woulod affect the temperature inside of it 
white  because it is said to no contract heat or absorb
white  i chose white cause it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other ones will just attract heat and the sun 
light gray  it would affect the dog house by keeping it cool  a dog that is active and does a lot of running  the dog would not want to got to a doghouse that is painted black because that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stay too hot to cool off 
black  it would keep the dog house warm because the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm 
white  this color wont make the doghouse to hot  to the highest temperature  the temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog  especially after more than 10 minutes 
dark gray  according to the experiment  black would be the best and most effecient color  in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse  that is   but  the case is  during the summer  it gets very warm  and what happens if you paint the dogs house black well  that color magnifies the suns heat  and you would indirectly scorch your poor dog  usually  though  the heat here is cold and not hot  so the best color for the dog house would be dark gray  because during the summer and heat  your dog wouldnt be too hot  and during the colder times  it will still keep the heat in well 
white  if the color of the doghouse is white  this will keep the house cool  according to the experiment  the black lid increased the air temperature by 29  deg  c in 10 minutes  while the white lid only increased it by 18  deg  c 
dark gray  the darker a color is the more heat energy it attracts  so the dark grey would attract not much heat energy to where its to hot  but it wont be to cold either 
dark gray  i think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors  this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials  it wouldnt be too cold or too hot 
black  the color may effect the dog house because it darker then any other other color
white  white will keep the dog house cold 
white  white would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract the reason black  dark grey  or light grey wouldnt work is in the table it shows for the averages  black is 53 and that is just to high  dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm  light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler than the dark gray but noy much  and then it shows white  and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat 
white  by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42  deg  c  and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53  deg  c  by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11  deg  c than painting the doghouse black  therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature 
white  if the doghouse is white  it will not become as hot as if it were painted black  the jar with the black lid had an average of 53  deg  c under the lamp  however  the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  c
black  i think the black paint would work best because it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors  the average temperature was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray  eight degrees higher than the light gray  and eleven degrees higher than the white paint 
dark gray  dark grey because  in the winter the dogf might get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse 
white  the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors dont 
white  the white would make it cooler inside so in the summer it wouldnt be hot
white  you should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much heat out as possible during the summeri say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53  deg  c  the average for dark gray was 48  deg  c  the average for light gray was 45  deg  and the average for white was 42  deg  c  so in conclution the white paint is 11  deg  c cooler than black paint  
white  white has the least air temperature  42  and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse 
black  black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker  it will affect the doghouse because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
dark gray  the dark gray will be a cooling and warming color for the doghouse  in all 3 trials it only got up to be 48  deg  and the black got up to 54  deg  c
white  it affects the inside of the dog house because if white is the color outside then on the inside it will be much cooler than black or dark gray since darker colors aborb more heat 
light gray  the color would affect the doghouse by not getting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter 
white  the white whould not be hot so the dog can not burn up  the temperatre was 42  deg  and the hight was the black at 53  deg   the diffentcies would be 11  deg  
black  that color wil affect the doghouse warming the inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging in from 52  deg  c54  deg  c and the lighter colors were in the 40  deg  c
light gray  its best  its not that dark and that light 
white  it will keep the dog cooler in the summer  in each test  the white lid was proven to stay the coolest  the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at 42 for trial 1  43 for trial 2  41 for trial 3  and 42 for trial 4 
black  it was hotter outside
white  the white is not dark and not light  white is between that 
dark gray  dark gary might affect the doghouse by keeping it hot in the winter but not to hot in the summer
black  the black will absorb more enery
light gray  its a lighter color and then it wont be that hot 
black  black would be the best choice in colder climates  washington  because it absorbs more heat  the dog would thusly be warmer if its doghouse was painted black  inside the jars  blacks average temperature is 53  deg  c  compared with white whichs average temperature was 42  deg  c  that is a difference of 11  deg  c 
black  if you use the color black  then the inside of the doghouse will have an increase in temperature  according to the experiment a black lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c  while the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  therefore i can conclude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature  which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse 
black  black affects the doghouse because is gonna be to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther 
white  how the color white would effect the dog house is  if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house  and if they painted it black it would be hotter  they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler 
black  in the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp 
black  because in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
white  white will not affect the doghouse because the sun will not go to the doghouse as black because black absoed more the energy so the godhouse will get hot as much as the coloer black 
white  having a white painted roof will reflect heat in the summer  so the dog will not overheat inside it 
white  having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler  this is because white is a color that doesnt absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog  in the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11  deg  c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler 
black  the sun will absorb the color black and the temperature will rise
light gray  this color would give the temperature afresh breeze in the hot summer days amp the fall
black  the dog would not be ale to see his house in the dark 
white  in this experiment  it proves that out of all the colors tested  white was the best  white stayed cooled the whole time  while others tempertures went up 
white  i dont think the color on the outside would affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood  but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be colder
black  black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53  deg  c  the white will will not make it as hot because its average temperature was 42  deg  c 
dark gray  i think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer  the black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white one had 41 degrees 
white  white  might make it colder in the winter than the spring  black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well
white  since white is such alight color it doesnt absorb so much energy and its cooler than the other colors  cooler conditions are best for a dog  in my opinion 
white  the white paint will keep the dog warm but not stifling hot  the paint had the lowest temp  of air in the lab as white doesnt attract heat like black does
white  white paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color  in the experiment  the white color had the lowest temperature  after 10 minutes  and was 42  deg  c  the light gray was 45  deg  c  the dark gray was 48  deg  c  and the black was 53  deg  c  since the white had the lowest temperature  it would keep the doghouse coolest  and therefore be the best to use 
light gray  the light gray because than i wont get to hot in the doghouse when its sunny out side because it wont absorb to much energy  but when its cold outside it will still be a little warm because it absorbing energy  so it would always be the perfect temperature for the dog
white  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
white  brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors 
dark gray  the color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white  or light grey  because in the experiment  the dark grey absorbed more heat  getting an average of 48 degrees c  compared to light greys 45 degrees and whites 42  black absorbs more energy  at about 53 degrees c   but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer 
white  because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
light gray  i chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldnt be too hot for the dog  or too cold  according to the data  the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45  deg  c while the black paint would be too hot at an average of 8776 53  deg  c and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42  deg  c
light gray  if darker colors absorb more heat  then im guessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too  so to keep it at an even balance  i would say the color light gray is the best choice 
black  painting the dog house black would make the air inside it warmer  in brandi and jerrys experiment  the average air temperate of the can with a black lid was 53  deg  c  whereas the dark gray was only 48  deg  c  the light gray was only 45  deg  c  and the white lid was only 42  deg  c  therefore  the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature 
white  if the color of the doghouse is white  then it would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outside the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot  the results from the experiment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid the temperature inside the glass jar was 42  deg  c and all the other temperature averages were a higher temperature than 42  deg  c 
dark gray  in the experiment  the dark gray lid made the air temperature inside the jar an average of 48  deg   c   if the doghouse was black the air temperature would be an average of 53  deg   c   if the doghouse was white the average temperature would be 42  deg   c   if the doghouse was dark gray then the dog wouldnt be too hot or too cold 
black  it would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out  the reason i would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day  the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog 
black  in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
white  this color through off more heat than the rest of them 
white  this color might affect the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and they wont burn up in the dark colors 
light gray  during the summer  the doghouse will stay a lot cooler than it would with it painted black  but in the winter  it would be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer 
white  i would choose white because you dont want the dog to get too warm 
black  that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air  for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in the air 
light gray  i dnt know
light gray  it will asorb some heat into the dog house  so that the dog could stay warm at most times 
white  if the doghouse was painted white  in the sum mer when it was very hot outside  then the dog would be able to go into the doghouse where it would be cool inside  i know this because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures  the lighter the color  the cooler it will be inside 
dark gray  it will make the doghouse cold and look dark even during the day 
black  bacause its black
light gray  i chose light gray because then the dog house wont be too cold or too warm with light gray  light gray was in the middle of the data  white would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot  the average temperture for white was 42  deg  c and the average temperture for black was 53  deg  c  light gray was the perfect choice because its average temperture is 45  deg  c 
white  in the data table it shows the black lid held in more hot air then all the other lids black lid held in  54  deg  c on trial 1 while the white lid held in  42  deg  c in the first trail the black lids average was 53  deg  c while the white lids average was 42  deg  c by comapreing the data it shows that the white lid holds in less air 
white  the best color to paint the dog house would be white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42  deg   43  deg   41  deg   and 42  deg  which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
black  it might effect it  by using this color it can make the doghouse more warmer on summer days 
white  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog will be cooler and white goes with everything 
white  white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
light gray  they might not beabol to see the thing
dark gray  that would help even it out 
white  white  because you want your dog to be cool enough and according to the lid color vs  air tempature inside glass jar chart  white is the coolest 
dark gray  i think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside  than if it was a lighter or darker color  i think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53  deg   dark grey was the second warmest at 48  deg   light grey was next at 45  deg   and white was least warmest at 42  deg  
white  i would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool  in the experiment  the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42  deg  c and the jar with the black lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c 
white  they should make the dog house with a white roof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool  instead of extremely hot  in their experiment the average for a white lid was 42  deg  c  as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53  deg  c  it would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off  instead of using black paint so it is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all 
black  because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be so hot
dark gray  i think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48  deg  and thats not hot so the dog is not going to be hot and 48  deg  is not cold either its cool so the dog wont be cold or hot itll be just right but thats my opinion 
black  if they were to paint the dog house black then the dog would stay warm  as in the experiment it shows that when they used the black lid  the temperature went from 24  deg  c to 53  deg  c in 10 minutes  and when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24  deg  c to 42  deg  c in 10 minutes  this showes that the darker the color  the greater increase in the air temperature  because the darker colors absorb more energy 
dark gray  it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldnt be too hot and it wouldnt be to cold 
white  the color white would keep the dog house at a cooler temperature
dark gray  how this color might affect the dog house is that with black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside  and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside  i chose dark grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather 
black  black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
dark gray  dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it to cold it absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold 
black  blach dontueist nating
light gray  light gray should be the cooler because in the summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so its not to hot or to cold 
dark gray  the color wont absorb to much heat therfore it wont be to hot inside  the darker the color the greater the heat
white  you would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would  therefor keeping the dog cooler in the summer time 
white  in the trails  the white lid got the least hot  so the dog house does not get to hot  they should paint it white 
black  it would have more air in the doghouse allowing the dog to breath easier 
white  reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler in the sumer
black  black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most  with the black lid the temperture was 53  deg  c  with the white lid the temperature was 42  deg  c  there was 11  deg  c difference 
white  i would say white because in the experiment the darker the color the hotter it got  and with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot 
white  because dog likes to touch things so they mite do something and make the lamp fall 
white  it would be the color that would attract the least amount of heat
dark gray 
black  the color black will affect the dog house in many ways  for example  it will be warm in there when its sunny out side  the way that i know this is  the temp of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but for white the average temp was 42 so as you can see this is how the color of the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in the doghouse 
light gray  the color light gray would have to be the best color to paint the doghouse  they wouldnt want to use black because since black is a dark color itll absorb more energy amp make the air temperature rise high  so black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot  that is why i chose light gray because i think its just righ to paint the doghouse  with light gray  the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold  they would be just right 
dark gray  when it rains or gets cold the doghouse will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
white  it would make it cooler cause the color isnt dark 
light gray  it is not too hot or too cold
dark gray  it might affect the doghouse by adding heat  but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught the day when the sun hits on it  it would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot 
white  the dog house would not get too hot in the summer because white doesnt attract as mutch heat from the sun 
black  black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors  in the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar  the air temperature will be 53  deg  c on average and with a white lid  the air temperature would be 42  deg  c on average  this shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11  deg  c and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest 
white  that color might help to keep the air temperature lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray  this was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white  42  deg   was lower than the average temperature for black and gray  45  deg   53  deg   
light gray  i think the best paint color is light gray be cause that way the temperature inside the doghouse will be warmer than the outside  so it wont be too cold inside  but it wont be too hot like a black roof might cause it to be
black  so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the soummer so the dog wouldent freeze at night
white  a white doghouse would absorb less energy  and its temperature would be cooler  in the experiment  the jar with the light  white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest  black lid  a dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperature  and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun  and cool in summer 
light gray  that color will not effect the doghouse because the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
black  the doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors  like black  abosorb heat 
black  the color black would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment  the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors 
black  black would be good for a doghouse roof because in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at an average of 53  deg  and the onther three colors only in the fortie  deg  range  so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for the dog 
white  this color might affect the doghouse by keeping it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
white  the best color to paint the dog house would be white because in the experiment the white lid didnt get as hot as the black lid  the black lid reached an average of 53  deg  c  but the white lid only reached 42  deg  c  also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool
black  if the dog house was black it would attract more light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer when its outside 
white  if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were painted black or the two shades of gray  the shades of gray and the black paint caused the jar to at least get up to 45  deg  c and at the most the jar got to 53  deg  c so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white paint for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42  deg  c when they used the white lid 
dark gray  if the dog house is dark gray  then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to much heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days  because the darker the color the more heat that is absorbed  if the color is not completely black then not to much heat energy will be absorbed 
white  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot 
dark gray  by painting the doghouse dark gray  it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not over heating it  however  if placed in an already warm outside temperature  the inside could in fact overheat  so a dark gray doghouse would be preferable in a cooler enviroment 
light gray  the dog house would not be hot  but it would not be too cold either 
dark gray  you want the doghouse to be hot but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle
dark gray  dark gray should keep the dog house a medium temprature that isnt too hot  or to cold 
light gray  light gray would keep the doghouse warm so the dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot 
black  black absorbes more heat energy  so the inside of the dog house will stay warm if it has alight source  the sun   this is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53  deg  with the light source being the heat source 
white  the colors affect the temperature of inside the dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white  i chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42  deg  c  the ave rage of black was 53 25  deg  c  dark gray 48  deg  c  light gray 45  deg  c  and white 42  deg  c  all of this data was from the experiment  the difference is 11 25  deg  c from lowest average to higest average 
white  if you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun  and the dog will like it     
black  the color will affect how warm or cold the dog house is  because the white would be 42  deg  and black would be 53  deg  
light gray  light gray wont affect the dog house in any way 
white  i choose white because if it gets hot in the summer than the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose and paws
light gray  light gray holds the same temprature of 48  deg  every time
white  my dog like white
light gray  light gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool  but not to cold  and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog  the data shows tha the light gray jars average temperature was 45  deg  c  while the black jar was 53  deg  c  and the white jar is 42  deg  c  so the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog 
white  because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes which is 42  deg  c
white  the color white is the color that got the lowest air tempature on the lid color vs air tempature inside glass jar  so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most comfortable 
white  the best paint color for the doghouse is white  this is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat  the dog wouldnt want a hot sweaty dog house  after 10 minutes of heat from the lamp  the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53  deg  c  but the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  the white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot  moisty and sweaty 
dark gray  this color would deflect heat but also keep the inside warm 
light gray  it well keep it from getting to hot
white  white is the color most likely perfered because the color white doesnt absorb the suns radiations so it doesnt heat up as hot as others would 
white  painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat  and the inside will stay cooler then if it were painted a darker color
black  the color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white  because black had an average temp of 53 degrees  and the color white had an average temperature of 42 degress  making the temperature 11 degrees warmer 
white  if the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days  the average lowest temperature after 10 minutes alight was 42  deg  with the white lid 
dark gray  darker colors absorb more energy 
dark gray  the dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and heat 
white  itll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun 
white  in the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler 
white  i would choose white because  the tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42  deg  c and the other ones are hotter like light gray is 45  deg  c and dark gray is 48  deg  and  black at 53  deg  so i would have choose the coolest  least hottest  one so the dog would not get hot
white  using white as the color for the dog house roof would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is black  so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house 
white  the color white will affect the doghouse in a good way  the color white dosnt absorb as much heat as the other colors do  when they did the experiment the color white only got to 42  deg  c while the color black got to 53  deg  c  also  white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42  deg  c  which means inside the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it doest absorb as much heat as the other colors do 
light gray  light gray because in the summer it will not ge ttoo hot and in the winter it will not get that cold 
white  because the dog house wont get too warm and dogs have fur on them therefore they would not want there doghouse to get to warm 
white  white  because the white lid temputature only went up to 42  deg  c  the other lid colors got a higher temputature  so i chose the one that had the least temputature 
dark gray  it would make it cooler in the summer and warm in the winter
black  it could make it to warm for the dog  it depends on the weather 
dark gray  the dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out  the doghouse wont absorb to much heat 
dark gray  i think that dark gray would be the best color to have on a dog hose because  the dark gray had a steady tepature on it that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day 
white  white would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42  deg  c 
white  the lighter the color  the cooler the dog house will be causeing it to be more comfertable the white lid was an average of 42  deg  c 3  deg  c coller than the other lids
light gray  the color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature  not to cold and not to warm 
white  becuase from there experiment the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
white  the color will affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse colder  by painting the doghouse white the air temperature inside the doghouse will stay lower  since white is alight color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will 
black  painting the doghouse black would cause the temperature to increase the most  in the experiment the average air temperature in the glass with the black lid was 53  deg  c  the glass with the dark gray lid was 48  deg  c  the glass with the light gray lid was 45  deg  c and the glass with the white lid was 42  deg  c  this proves that if brandi and jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint  otherwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse 
black  the black color would make the dog house warmer for the winter  so that the dog will stay warm 
dark gray  it is the second highest and it should keep the dog house worm with out geting to hot
dark gray  my opinion for light gray cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four collors so i thing that the dog wont get hot if the collor method works
white  because white doesnt attarct as much heat and therefore the dog would be a lot cooler in a white dog house than a black one for example 
white  the color white will make it cooler in the dog house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has 
white  white would be the smarter choice  because it reflects heat verses absorbing it  according to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside  having black roofing tiles would be smart as well  because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside  together these two colors would make a very comfortable house 
white  i chose the color white for the doghouse  this is because if the darker the color  the greater increase in temperature  then i would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray  dark gray and black  this would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer  the darker the color  the greater increase in temperature is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar with the black lid was 53  deg  c when the average temperature of the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42  deg  c  the white lid jar was 11  deg  cooler than the black lid jar 
black  that color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark  and the tempeture will be really high 
dark gray  i chose this color for the doghouse because since the doghouse will be located outside  you dont want the dog to be cold at night all dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways  the experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air temperature inside the jar  the darker the lid  the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat  which is why i chose dark gray for the doghouse  so its not too warm for the dog  but if the dog gets hot  it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep 
dark gray  dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also 
black  it wont be as hot
light gray  it can effect the ray of the sun
black  i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
white  you would probably want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse  when the sun is shinning it is usually warm outside  and the dog will want to use it to cool off  not to get even more hot 
white  the color might affect the doghouse by keeping it cool  in the experiment  white had the average of 42  deg  c  as for black had an average of 53  deg  c  therefore  42  white  is less than 53  black   so brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white 
white  the doghouse will be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white 
black  black absorbs all colrs and the data table show that the average for black paint is 53 degrees
white  white was the lid color with the coolest temperature after 10 minutes  painting the dog house white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the suns he at than say black paint  in other words the darker the color the more heat it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house  we want to keep the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesnt over heat 
white  the color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower 
dark gray  i chose dark gray because it will keep warm in side but also it will keep cool when needed  so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if its cold out side it wiill be cool but also warm as well  i know this because with the dark gray average temperature was 48  deg  c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53  deg  c and the white average was 42  deg  c 
white  the color white would keep the dog house not as hot inside as the other colors  becasue white had the lowest temperature in the experiment  whit had the lowest temperature average which was 42  deg  c  light grays average was 45  deg  c  dark grays average was 48  deg  c  blacks average was 53  deg  c  that shows us that white had the lowest temperature and will keep the dog house not as hot 
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house light gray  if the dog house is painted in light gray  the temperature inside the dog house would not be too hot or too cold  in the result shows that the air temperature with light gray lid is 45  deg  c  with white its 42  deg  c  and with dark gray its 48  deg  c  temperature with light gray is warmer than white lid  but its not too hot like the dark gray ones 
white  this color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors   see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black  53 dark gray 48 light gray 45 white  42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color sit shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and thats why i think white should be what they choose 
black  it is warmer than other colors
white  white because blakc would absorb alot of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat and dehydrate the dog  same with  dark gray  and light gray  white would be the best choice because white reflects light  as appose to absorbing it  making the inner tempature cooler and more comfordable for the dog 
light gray  i choose light gray because it is not to cold anfd not to hot just right if i choose a darker color it might get to hot for the dog and if it is a really light color it will be to cold and wont ke3ep him warm 
white  the color white is the best choice  it will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture  this is proven by the data gathered by the trials  according to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on ajar was 53  deg  c  when the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42  deg  c  this proves that white would be abetter temperature control factor 
black  black would effect the dog house because its a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog house warmer inside  in the experiment when brandi and jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53  deg  c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42  deg   in the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house 
light gray  light gray will make the inside of the doghouse warm but not too hot  so in the winter a dog wont be cold but in summer it wont be too hot either  45  deg  c is a good warm temperature and the temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed 
light gray  it wont get as much heat as black because dark colors absorb more heat then other colors 
light gray  light gray will keep the temperture of the dog house not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter  if the dog house was white it would have a temerture average of 42  deg  c and if the dog house was black it would have an average temerture of 53  deg  c and the dark gray would be to warm as well at 48  deg  c
white  painting the dog house white would be very smart if you didnt want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summer days  based on brandi and jerrys experiment the color black gives off more 11  deg  c opposed to the color white 
white  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white will give off less heat and the dog will stay cool 
black  black paint would warm the inside of the doghouse more than the other colors  in the experiment  black heated up an average of 53  deg  c  while the other colors were never increased more than 48  deg  c  if it was cold outside  that color would warm the doghouse more because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy 
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house  it should be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy the dark gray will make he dog feel more relaxed  because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors 
dark gray  the dark gray color would absorbe more heat than a white or light gray color  keeping the dog warmer  when the temperature is colder  but when the temperature is warmer outside it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would  keeping the dog cooler 
white  this color would keep the dog house colder than the other colors because from the recorded data  blacks average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when whites was only 42 degrees celc ius
white  white because it will make it a lot more cool temperature wise than if it were black because darker colors absorb a lot more heat
white  will they would like the dog to stay warm in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
white  i would choose white because it attrackes less heat to the dog house 
black  it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
black  it will make it very hot in the dog house
dark gray  i choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white  its a perfect temperature for the dog in my opinion  it doesnt have to much heat but just right  its a relaxing amount of heat 
white  they should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the house and white does not attract heat or the sun light 
white  this might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun  white would bring a minimum amount of heat 
black  if you paint the dog house black the dog house would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house  i know this because in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar with the black lid was the hotest 
dark gray  dark gray would be a good color for a dog house because it will keep the dog house warm during the winter and during the summer the dog will spend most of its time outside its house  the results in the experiment were 48  deg  c solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house  not too hot and not too cold 
black  if they would like the dog to stay warmer  they should chose black because on average  the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid 
light gray  i choose light gray because it would be a nice temperature  if the dog house was panted black the temperature would average 53  deg  c  if it was dark gray the temperature would average 48  deg  c  if the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 42  deg  c  but alight gray color would make the average tempurature a nice comfertable 45  deg  c 
light gray  it well make it lighter so the dog can see more better 
dark gray  i chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot  it really depends on where the people live and on the season  dark gray  48  deg  c  would be more suitable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black  53  deg  c   but it also would be warm during the winter  so its a compromise between the weather  the temperature used for explanation was the average 
light gray  i think that light gray would be the best color because it absorbs enough light to make the dog warm  without getting it too hot  black would make it too hot  and white would make it too cold 
black  if you painted the dog house black  the inside would be hot  because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot  the average for the temperature was 53  deg  c for black  the average for dark gray was 48  deg  c and gray was 45  deg  c  also white was 42  deg  c  according to this data  black would make things hot 
white  having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat  so if you paint the house white  then there wont as much heat on the walls  making the doghouse cooler  this is shown by the fact that in the jar experement  black had the hottest data and white had the coolest 
light gray  light gray because it will not be to hot or cold
white  if they used white the doghouse would be colder inside then it would if the doghouse was black  the reason why it would be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black  darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors 
white  the darker the color  the greatest increase in temperature because darker colors absorb more energy  the white would keep the doghouses roof cool on a very sunny day  since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors 
dark gray  i chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold  the average of the four averages was 47  deg  c so i chose the closest one to 47  deg  c and dark gray was 48  deg  c so thats why i chose dark gray 
black  the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it  good conductor
white  white because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42  deg  c  if the they painted it white  it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days 
white  white because black colors  dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color white the te mparture would be cooler in there 
white  the tempicher will still rise but less then the other ones
white  this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer 
white  white had the lowest average temperature so it would be more relaxing for the dog 
black  black would be the best color to paint the doghouse  one way we know that is  when we did the expiriment with the lid colors  black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius  while white ended up with 42 degrees celcius  this proves that black absorbs the most heat  if we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse 
white  white dosnt obsorb light how ever black dose
dark gray  dark gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse  not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black 
black  the darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun  which would make the dog house much warmer  they said  becau se darker colors absorb more energy  
black  black might affect the inside of the dog house because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors 
light gray  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
white  i would say that painting the dog house white would be the best option because white absorbs the leat amount of heat energy and since doghouses are already small they are already hot and you dont want the dog to get overheated  plus dogs have lots of fur to keep them even warmer  if there is a chilly day in the winter  you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm  but i would say that altogether  white is the best choice 
light gray  the color brandi amp jerry should choose should be light grey because if it was too dark  then the house would get to hot  but if it was too light  it would be more cooler then the black  but it would be very dirty 
white  if they choose white  then the increase in temperature will be the lowest of all the colors 
dark gray  the dark gray color would keep the dog house pretty cool during the summer  but also wouldnt be too cold during the winter because the temperature was the same the whole time 
black  black because it atracts sun and makes the dog house have more heat
white  if they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors 
dark gray  dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay 
black  because the paint changes color thr hotter it gets
white  i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint  and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40  deg   so the sun shining on the dog house that would put the dog house at 80  deg  inside during the day  then at night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
black  the black paint will make the dog house warmer for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat  with the highest average temperature  53  deg  c  
black  i think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse  the average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees  therefore  black is the better color to paint the doghouse 
light gray  if the color was darker but not black it would keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to hot beacause like in the experiment it was warm but not hot
light gray  i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog warm in the winter 
white  the white will affect the tempenture inside the doghouse by making it cooler  the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable 
dark gray  ahaha why are all of these questions soo frea ken hard ahaha
white  it will help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
black  the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said thatdarker colors absorb more energy  heat   so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm 
black  the darker color absorbs more energy
dark gray  dark grey because its not too dark so that the dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm  the average temp was 48  deg  c so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold 
dark gray  i would use dark gray  the darker colors would keep the doghouse warmer  black had an average of 53  deg   whereas white had only 42  deg   however  we must remember that a dog is a living thing  and cannot overheat  dark gray had an average of 48  deg   this is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature  so  in conclusion  ive determined that dark gray is the most logical choice 
white  i chose white because white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature  when they did the experiment  the black was the hottest  53  deg  c   the dark gray was in the middle  48  deg  c   the light gray was also in the middle  45  deg  c  and the white was the coolest  42  deg  c  
light gray  light gray because its not to light and its not to dark
white  it was the coolest with the temp  of 42  deg  c  it would be to hot to use black which was 53  deg  c  inside the jar 
white  the color whit will keep the dog house coller  becuase the color whit deflects light better making the dog house cooler 
light gray  it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog 
white  the lid color white could make a difference between the black lid  the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog 
white  its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
white  the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black  dark grey or light grey  what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house
black  i chose the black color becasue that if the dog likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what color would be the hotes and the trials number are 54  deg   52  deg   53  deg    deg  c  and the average temp  is 53  deg  c if the dog likes it hot in there
white  darker colors usually attract more light  by attracting more light  it usually makes things much warmer  so  if you have the lightest color there is  then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler  according to the data  using a black lid made the jar about 53 degrees  the dark gray made it about 48 degrees  the light gray made it 45 degrees  and the white was about 42 degrees  as you can see  the lightest color had the lowest temperature  so  by using the lightest color  it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint 
black  a dark color like black will affect the inside of the doghouse because the darker the color  the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy 
white  i would choose white  one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did 
white  the white color does not absorb as much energy as black  in the doghouse the temperature will be about 42  deg  c when it is a sunny day 
dark gray  first  where ever you live if its always warm i would paint it light colored  but if the area you live in is always cold i would paint it a dark color  my theory is  your dog is going to stay warm if the weather is always warm  your dog will be warm during the day or night when your dog house is a dark color  the dark color is going to attract the energy 
black  if the weather where brandi and jerry live is cold  if they painted the doghouse black  it would absorb more heat than dark grey  light grey  and white 
light gray  light grey would be good because it wouldnt get hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it really hot inside the dog house 
black  if they paint the doghouse black  their dog will always stay warm  because the color black will give the most heat  i know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53  deg  c and the others were in the low fortys 
white  this color might make the interior of the house cooler 
white  this color will be best because when its hot outside  the doghouse will be cooler than if they painted it black or darker color 
black  black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature 
black  dfg
dark gray  i think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because  it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures  if they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it doest attrack to much heat  if they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat  light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white  so i think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat  and that in the winter it does too  so it would be even out in both summer and winter 
white  white wont effect the dog house because white dosnt absorb that much heat so the dog wont get so hot and not be able to use the dog house
dark gray  if the dog house was painted black  the dog would get too hot in the summer time becuase the color black absorbs more energy  but if the dog house was painted white  the dog would be easily cold in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy  in conclusion  painting the dog house dark gray will attract the right amount of energy for the dog 
white  because white reflects off the sun so it would keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light and would keep the dog very hot 
black  i believe that the dog house should be painted black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter  the data shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53  deg  c when the black lid was used  using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in the glass jar  a disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house will be too hot  but as for the winter the black is the correct choice 
white  the lighter the color the lower the temperature  the average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53  deg   the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48  deg   the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45  deg   and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42  deg   therefore alight gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors  but if you were to use black or dark gray  it would keep the dog house warmer 
white  the color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors  then the dog house will get too hot and your dog will be hot aswell  as the study shown  the color black had an average of heating up to 53 degrees celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did  same as the color black  dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color dark gray had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white  also in the study  the color light gray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degrees celcious hotter than the color white  the best color that brandi and jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color white because the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made  the avergae degrees in celcious for white was 42 degrees celcious and if they paint their dog house this color  the dog house wouldnt get hot nor your dog 
white  this might affect th dog house by making it cooler in there intead of really hot all the time 
black  blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors  this is because black absorbs the most amount oif colors over every other color  to prove this in brandi and jerrys experiment black kept the temperature of the jar warmer than all the rest  it was 6  deg  c warmer than gray  10  deg  c warmer than light gray  and 12  deg  warmer than white  this clearly shows that black would keep the doghouse warm 
dark gray  during the winter  brandi and jerrys dog will stay nice and warm  but not to warm  when summer comes 
white  it could get dirty  you could piant it over agia  and you could draw on the walls 
black  the dark paint color is better because the greater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse  becouse darker color absorbs more energy 
white  if brandi and jerry use the color white for the dog house the dog will not over heat because the color white does not attract the heat as much as the darker colors so the dog house would be much cooler 
black  cuz black is ugly just like robert patteson
white  white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42  deg   and black averged 53 25  deg  so to have a cooler dog house paint it white 
white  while using white for the dog house the dog house would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows that the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did  that way the dog would not be so hot in its house 
black  black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was 
dark gray  i would choose dark gray because it doesnt attract a ton of light  which means the dog wont get to hot  but also because it does attract some light which allows it stay warm 
black  the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat 
white  white is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would  and then the doghouse wouldnt be too hot for the dog 
white  having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be cool inside during the summer  because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53  deg  and the white lids average temperature was 42  deg   thats a 11  deg  difference  so painting the doghouse white would be the best decision of paint 
light gray  light gray because it wont be too hot diring the summer  also wont be to cold in the winter 
white  it wont be so hot inside and it will stay cool
dark gray  this will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold 
dark gray  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature 
white  because if the dog uses it in the summer it will be cooler then a black dog house
white  its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace 
black  black would be a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and it would be more confortable 
dark gray  i think it would be a good color for the dog house
white  white will effect the dog house first this will effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer  because white doesnt absorb very much heat 
black  black absorbs light  just like with the jar lid when it was black  it absorbed the most  so if you colored the doghouse black it would increase the temperature inside it 
black  they should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold when they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3  deg  c  copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42  deg  c thats a difference of 11  deg  c 
white  because light colors are the coolest in the summer time so with white being the lightest one white would work best 
white  it will make it be cooler in the dog house
white  the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool  as shown in the table from the scenario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  compared to the glass jar with the black lids average temperature of 53  deg  
light gray  light gray cause this will give the dog house some darkness but also bright  so the dog will be able to stay cool and can sleep 
white  i chose white becauseit was the color that absorbed less heat
black  if brandi and jerry painted the dog house black then the dog house would be warmer because the darker the color is the energy the dog house can absorb 
dark gray  it might make the doghouse warmer during winter months  for example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48  deg  c
black  since black is the darkest color of all the other colors  dark gray  light gray  and white   because of the theory that darker colors absorbs more energy  heat   the inside of the doghouse will be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors  the proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because black is the darkest of all the other colors  and darker colors absorbs more energy  also if you look at the data table for the lid color vs  air temperature inside glass jar experiment  the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53  deg  c  dark gray being 48  deg  c  light gray being 45  deg  c  and white being 42  deg  c  therefore  black would be the best paint color for the doghouse 
white  its obsorves less energy from the sun than all the darker colors
light gray  the inside wont be too hot nor too cold
white  it will make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 degrees
dark gray  i think dark grey would be the best one because it stays at the same temperture every trial  also it would be the bes tone because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it stays at the same constant temperture of 48  deg  c so that color on the dog house would be realiable 
black  the black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better  in the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24  deg  c and ended at 53  deg  c on average  it was by far the best lid 
black  the color my affect the dog house because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dark because its black 
black  painting the dog house black  darker colors absorb more light  would attract more thermal energy  making the dog house nice and warm for those rainy washington nights 
white  white because it doesnt absorbe light it reflects it so thier for the in side of the dog house is not going to hot  but if you use black the in side of the dog house is going to be very hot because black absorbs light 
dark gray  it would keep it warm in the dog house
white  black and gray obsorb the color 
black  if brandy and jerry pick paint their dog house black then the dogs will get very hot in the doghouse because black absorbs the most energy  as a result  painting the dog house black with attract the sun and make the dogs misserable 
light gray  light gray would be best so that it keeps the inside warm but not too hot  in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color 
black  the color will affeect the doghouse because it will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight 
white  this color will make the air in the doghouse less hot  so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse  i know this because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one  so if the sun is beating down on the doghouse  it will only reach about 42  deg  c  instead of 45  deg  c or higher 
white  color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
white  the shade white will make the dog house cooler inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black  i know this because in brandi and jerrys experiment  the air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53  deg  c  and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42  deg  c  but id like to point out that black and white arent colors  theyre shades  get it right 
white  the color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that way the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated 
white  white affects the dog house temperature because it has less heat obsorbing in it 
dark gray  the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot  the data shows that the dark gray is always 48  deg  c so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter 
white  if you paint the entire doghouse white then it will appear to be lighter inside 
white  it will make it for inside of the dog house it wont ne so hot because this is the color that reflects light 
white  white will cool down the dog house because it is a lighter color 
white  it will affect it by making it cooler than what the black would be if it were to be directly hit by the sun  the black lid had an average of 53  deg  c and the white lid had an average of 42  deg  c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun 
white  i believe that if bbrandi and jerry pain the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog  evidence shows that the darker the color the more hot it gets  for exsample the average temperature for black is 53  deg   the average temperature for dark gray is 48  deg   the average tempertaure for light gray is 45  deg   the white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42  deg   i sugest painting the dog house white 
white  the color white would affect the dog house in many good ways  one way is it wouldnt be so hot in the dog house and the dog would enjoy being in it  the data table shows the temperature through a three way trial  the average temperature is 42  deg  c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures 
dark gray  it will stay the same even after it drys   
black  it will make the inside of the doghouse warmer for the dog because dark colors obsorb more heat then light color s as shown in the investigation 
white  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it wont make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out  white wont attract as much heat inside the dog house  as we discovered in the experiment  white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter color  as the colors got darker  the temperature got hotter 
white  the lightest color attracts less heat 
light gray  it would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
white  i think that the white will affect the dog house because the sun will shine in and melt it
black  i would chooose black for my dogs house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black  black is the best color to choose becouse in the test it was an average of 11  deg  c hotter
white  white dosent absorb much energy compared to black  black absorbs the energy like crazy
light gray  light gray because it wouldnt make it to hot in the dog house sour dog could sleep comfurabley
black  i chose the paint color black because this color would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time  even on a cloudy or rainy day  brandi and jerrys doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the sun  after 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid  the air s average temperature raised 29  deg  c from the starting temperature of 24  deg  c to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3  deg  c  the glass jar with the white lids average air temperature raised only 18  deg  c from the starting temperature of 24  deg  c to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42  deg  c  the difference between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the black lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10  deg  c  this means that the darker the color on an object  the more heat energy the color absorbs  causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it  therefore  brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the color absorbs 
black  because the temperature will be high and not low  painting it black is the highest temperature
white  i choise white because white would keep the doghouse cool in the summer 
white  the white had the lowest temp  in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm 
white  white duns not atat so mush heat
white  white would make the doghouse the least temperature the data showed that the temperature was on average 42  deg  c  the doghouse would be a cool enviroment  instead of too hot  the doghouse would be a place for the dog to go when he is too hot 
white  white will make the dog house cooler so its more comferable in hot weather 
light gray  it will affect it because it will absorb less heat
white  barndi and jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun  causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable 
white  white will not absorb so much heat than the others 
light gray  the color light grey is best for the dog house because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze 
white  the color white absorbs the least amount of energy  so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog 
dark gray  dark gray would be a good color for the doghouse so that the dog doesnt overheat or get too cold  the house would stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter  dark gray had an average temperature of 48  deg  c while black had an average temperature of 53  deg  c and white had an average temperature of 42  deg  c 
black  if you choose a black color for your dog house the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color  because the air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs
light gray  it will keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter 
white  the lighter the color  the less air temperature  the white lid color has an average of 42  deg  c  the black lid color has an average of 53  deg  c  the white lid color has 11  deg  c less heat energy than the black lid color  therefore  if brandi and jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer  then they should use the color white since itll be cooler    vise versa  if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather  then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color  the darker the color  the more heat 
black  this color  black  may effect the inside of the doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer  i say this because in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars  so  id pick the color black if you live in a cold climate  because the black color will absorb the the light and make the dog warmer 
white  white because white has the least heat drawn to it then all the other colors so your dog would be way cooler and in better shape in a white dog house then any others 
dark gray  dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would be perfect for your dog
white  the color will keep the doghouse more cold in the summer 
white  it wont be as hot as the other paints would let heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experiment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
light gray  the color of the dohouse should be light gray  because if the dog house is black its going be very hot inside the dog house in the summer and light gray would be an ok temperature an ave rage of 45  deg  c for the summer and da winter  and every other seson
white  white would make the doghouse less hot on sunny day making it a place where the dog can cool down 
white  if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse white  than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray  the average temperature for white was 42  deg  c  while the average temperature for black was 53  deg  c  the difference of the two was 11  deg  c  so this proves that white would be the best color to choose 
white  it will keep the doghouse the coolest  avearg e for white was 42  deg  c  which would keep the dog from overheating 
white  if the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house  because black dog houses get hoter and faster  than white dog house  if it was white it would stay around 40  deg  instead of 44  deg   48  deg   and 55  deg  
white  the color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black  brown 
white  that will affect the doghouse becuase that way there wont be to much pressure in the dog house  then the dog will be comfortable
white  it would make it cooler on the inside
white  if the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder  in the experiment black paint made the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53  deg  c and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar of 42  deg  c 
dark gray  i would go with dark gray  so that way it doesnt attract lots of heat  but just enough heat so that way it stays warm inside  but not really warm 
black  i chose black  because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through watersprinklers and in the winter  the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside  the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse  
dark gray  i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and the average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed whit it be to cold 
black  the black lid will attract more heat to the dog house 
white  because that color stayed the coolest on the jar
dark gray  the color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm  the reason i know this is because in the expi rament hot lamp the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees  which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the light gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid which was 53  deg  c
dark gray  the dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house 
white  the lighter the color  the cooler the dog will be  when the lid color was at its darkest  black  the average temperature was 53 degrees celcius  when the lid color was at its lightest  white  the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius  if brandi and jerry want to keep their dog cool  they should use white paint 
white  cause for each trail and avrage  it is the lowest tepature 
black  i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree c  deg  
white  tha color will atract so much heat
black  the darker a color is the more heat it takes in  with the dog house painted black it will absorb more heat rather than if it was painted white which reflects heat  in the experiment when the glass jar had the black lid the tempurature was 11  deg  higher than when the jar had the white lid  this proves that darker colors absorb more he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat 
light gray  the color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45  deg  c  so from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather  also it wont be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in 
light gray  the color will make sure the inside doesnt get too hot or too cold 
white  if the dog house is white then it will be cooler in the dog house for the dog 
black  i will keep the dog warmer at night and during winter when its cold 
white  it should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color 
dark gray  dark gray will effect the doghouse tempature because the air in the doghouse will stay the same all the time 
black  it would keep the dog house warm  because darker colors absorb more energy
dark gray  beause he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep 
dark gray  this color is not to cold or to hot  it is around normal temperature  after 10 minutes it should be around the same temperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
black  the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in side by makeing it hot 
white  keeps the doghouse cool and does not over heat
dark gray  this color can affect the doghouse by keeping an even temperature year round  so the dog house wont get to hot or too cold for the dog  the dark gray lid kept the same temperature the entire test  giving me a conclusion that the dark gray color gives an even temperature 
white  the paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white white is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day  so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesnt get overheated  i know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows  which is that the color whites average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42  deg  c which was the lowest average temperature while the color blacks average temperature was 53  deg  c which was the highest temperature  which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day  and that would be bad for the dog   so that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse 
dark gray  i think that if you choose a color to dark  then it might make the dog really hot  so i would choose dark gray because it wont very hot or very cold  dark gray has trials that are 48  deg  c which is hot  however  it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54  deg  and its also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41  deg   so dark gray would be a good color for a dog house 
white  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture  average tempature was 42  deg  c for white  unlike the black were that is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53  deg  c  if they want cool for the doghouse then use the white 
black  black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when its in the sun  the color will change lighter 
white  because the white will not atract that much heat like the other colors 
white  because white does not obsorb as much heat as black  the dog house will be cooler  the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one 
white  in the experiment  the white lid kept the temperature in the glass the coolest  so if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse white  itll keep the inside cool for the dog 
black  the darker the paint the the greater the increase in air tempurature in the dog house  because dark colors absorb more energy 
light gray  different color affect the doghouse color affect the heat in the doghouse
black  the black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house  in the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius  for the lowest color  white  it was 42 degrees celcius  this means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up the house 
white  the white color will keep the dog house cool and not hot  i know this because from the data the white lid was the coldest and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar was 
white  if the dog house is white it will be colder in the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to be in it
white  the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot  in the experiment black which was the darkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white  the lightest color  had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
white  the color white would reflect the suns rays and keep the dog house cool 
light gray  light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot 
white  assuming that brandi and jerry live in a warm climate  a white doghouse would be the better choice  this is because white absorbs less heat  so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler 
black  black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat  thermal energy   so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is light as in the color white it will reflect heatthermal energy 
dark gray  i picked dark grey because it will be consistantly 48  deg  c i know because in the table for each trial it was 48  deg  c 
light gray  light gray would keep the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot  and it would still be abetter color than white for cold nights  this is true because the average temperature for the black lid was 53  deg  c  the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48  deg  c  the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45  deg  c  and the average temperature for the white lid was 42  deg  c
white  if you were to build a dog house you wouldnt want it to get to hot  so i would choose white  the average was 42  deg  c  since it was the coolest of the jars i think it would be best for the dog house 
white  the color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature  this color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldnt be so hot in the doghouse 
black  the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more energy 
white  the average temperature shows that using white paint for the dog house will be the best choice for keeping the dog cool 
white  white would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot  unlike the other colors which got hot really fast 
dark gray  the color will effect the dog house because if it is black it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its white then it will atracts less heat 
white  the white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too  the black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53  deg  c  but the white is 42  deg  c which is ok for the winter and the summer 
black  make it hoter
black  cause black is the darkest color which will make absorb the most heat 
white  white would be a good color  because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black  dark gray  or light gray  white will be cooler because in the hot lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above  and the average temperatrure for white was 42  deg  c  light gray was 45  deg  c  dark gray was 48  deg  c  and black was 53  deg  c  that shows that white was the coldest color while being shined on by light  therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse 
light gray  light gray because when it is sunny out the dog wont be hot beause black and other dark colors attract the sun 
white  white would keep the doghouse colder then any other colors and dogs hate when there hot and really cold so white is pe rfet
black  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black if they want the dog to stay warm  because black absorbed the most heat at an average of 53 25
light gray  it would keep the dog house at a good temp  the entire year round 
white  the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 degrees  and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees  and thus the doghouse will be cooler
black  well black absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog warmer 
light gray  light gray will affect the doghouse by keeping it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter  in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral 
white  because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be alight grey inside the dog house and so from that the dog house will be a nice shade of white with alight coat of grey on the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the dog house 
white  white  because the black attracts light so then the dog house would heat up  th edark gray is also like the black so that wont work either  the last decision was light gray or white so i picked white because that color doesnt attract light 
light gray  brandi and jerry should use light gray so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter 
white  if the doghouse is painted white the air temperature will be lower than light gray  dark gray  or black  the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45  deg  c  the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48  deg  c  and the black lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c  therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler 
white  if the color is a dark color then the temperature will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade  white was the color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and that would be the best color for the doghouses temperature 
white  because white its absorbs less energy there for cooler air tempeture
dark gray  it might affect the dog house a little  i choose dark gray because its average 
white  it wil be the coolest one at 42  deg  c and dogs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
light gray  the light gray is the best brcause it will absorb the heat from the sun but wont get to hot 
white  this color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once 
white  i chose white because from the results of the experiment  white had the lowest average temperature of 42  deg  c which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day 
light gray  this color might affect the dog house because in the summer  when its really hot  the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus the black  it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there  also  the light grey is good for the dogs wellbeing because during the winter time  the temperature will be really cold  but it would be dark enough to keep warm  so in conclusion  light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter  some evidence is that in the experiment  the average for the light grey was 45  deg  c and the average for the black was 53  deg  c  the light gray kept cool while the black did not  so during the summer  the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house  if they had alight grey house  they would have a nice cool house to lounge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winter as well black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter 
black  it will make the doghouse really warm inside because the darker the color the more it absorbs energy 
white  white color will give back the sunlight  it make the doghouse will not get too much hot 
white  the color white is a combination of all of the known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while projecting the combination color that it produces 
white  the color white would be a good color for doghouse because it heats up the air in it the least  in the experiment  the color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42  deg  c compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53  deg  c 
white  it would reflect the most sunlight so the inside temprature would be cooler than if you were to use any of the other c olors
white  this color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be 
dark gray  if they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse  the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too cold for the dog  i chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though the dogs have furs  if the temperature is cold  thye will get cold  so think dark gray is the best color to choose 
white  white would be the best color because it reflects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house 
dark gray  it will be warm inside the doghouse  but not too warm  the black lid made the air in the the jar very warm  thought it might be too hot for the dog 
white  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
dark gray  it will not be to hot or to cold
dark gray  i chose dark gray because black is the darkest color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors absorb more heat  as for white is would get the least amount of heat  main reason i chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be cold  so it will be warm but not too hot 
white  white would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one  the results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees c hotter than the jar with a white lid  and the same would apply to a doghouse 
light gray  well  if you paint the dog house light gray it will keep the dog warm at night  but not to warm were its over heated 
black  becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54  the other colors get less then that
white  if they use the white color than the dog house would be cooler because brighter colors reflect the sun and in the end it would bw cooler for the dog which would make the dog happier  also the white color would look good
black  brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse black  he will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53  deg  c  in the jar with the white lid  the average tempature was 42  deg  c  it will be 11  deg  c warmer in the black doghouse than the white one  that is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight 
white  this color will make the inside of the dog house cooler according to the data given by brandi and jerrys expirement 
dark gray  brandi and jerry should paint their dog house dark gray because dark gray doesnt ge to hot and isnt to cold  in the summer than the dog house will not get to warm yet it will not get to cold in the winter because it does attract some sunlight to keep it at an average of 48  deg  c  that way their dog can always enjoy its dog house no matter what the temperature is outside 
dark gray  the darker the color the warmer it is inside  and if it was black it would be to hot and white or light gray would get to cold 
black  make the doghouse warmer
white  white would be best because it reflects more energy  the table shows that the average temp  after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the highest average  52 degrees celcius  or the black lid 
black  the darker color obsorbs more heat so it would bi a good dog house
white  it would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat  this is because the darker the color  the more energy it absorbs 
white  the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other colors will beacuse the highest temp was 43  deg  c and the lowest was 41  deg  c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
black  it may affect the dog house by making it warmer than the dark grey  light grey and white paint would because the color black attracts heat more than any other color 
light gray  idk 
black  the solor energy  sun  will be attracted to the black paint  to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase 
white  if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11  deg  c cooler then the black  dark grey or light grey
light gray  the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside  as shown in the data table of the experiment  the data shows that the average temperature is 45  deg  c which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle 
white  i think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer  this experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color 
dark gray  dark gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse because its not too hot and its not too cold  the average temperature would be 48  deg  c  just right 
white  the dog house will be coller in the sun because the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black 
white  the color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light 
light gray  i would say light gray because if it was black and in the summer time it would be way to hot and if it was white in the winter it could get to cold so i think light gray is the best because it wouldnt be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter 
black  i pick black because black is a dark color and and darker colors atract energy  like heat  so that way the inside of the dog house will be worm like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10  deg  and less 
light gray  the color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48  deg  c is really hot so why not make it less like 45  deg  c  and 42  deg  c and 53  deg  c is to cold and too hot so make it warm     wouldnt u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were
white  it would keep the doghouse cooler 
white  the color white absorbed the least heat out of all the colors so the doghouse would not get overheated inside and stay cool just in case there was a hot summer day
white  i would pick white because with white it stays cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside 
black  the color will make the doghouse warmer  decreasing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduction of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse walls to the dog  thus facilitating the dogs survival while maximizing cos tefficiency  therefore the doghouse should be black  quod erat demonstratum
dark gray  this color would keep the temperature just right  it wouldnt be too hot or to too cold  the average  deg  c was 48  deg  c  the lowest average wsa 42  deg  c and the highest average was 53  deg  c 
white  choosing white for the color of the doghouse will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because darker colors absorb more energy 
white  the darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
black  it will make it so that the dog will be warmer at winter 
light gray  i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24  deg  c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold 
light gray  black because it would get to hot for the dog and white because it could also get to cold
light gray  i think light gray  because from the data that was the color that was almost in the middle  so that the dog house wouldnt get too heated in the summmer or spring  and it wouldnt get too cold in the winter or fall 
 do they want the dog house to be warmer or co oler if they want to have the dog house warm all year choose black paint  if they want ithe dog house cooler all year then chose white paint  if they want the dog house to be lukewarm chose gray paint  if they wanted it to be medeumcold chose light gray paint  not enof info to tell what you are asking for
white  black could cause the inside of the doghouse to heat up quickly because the color black heats up faster then most other colors 
white  white will keep the dog house cool on a hot summer day more than a darker color such as black  white was on averge 11  deg  c cooler than black 
black  since dark colors capture more heat  use black for color to help keep doghouse warm 
light gray  the best paint color to paint a dog house based on the results is light gray  i said light gray because it was average 45  deg  c  it is not too hot and not too cold  if you painted the dog house light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm  the black lid was average 53  deg  c  it got hotter because the color was darker  the dark gray was average 48  deg  c  it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark  the light gray was average 45  deg  c  it got cooler because the lid color was lighter  the white lid averaged 4 2  deg  c because it was the lightest  and dark colors absorb more heat 
white  white might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do  black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42 
black  the color might affect by since it is black it will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmerhotter 
white  the color white will keep the doghouse cool under sunlight  because in the expirement  the white color reflects sunlight  not absorbing it  so  the doghouse will be cooler
white  if it is a lighter color then the doghouse wont get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color 
white  this color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors  in average 42  deg  c  also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer 
light gray  they should use light gray paint because the black would attract too much heat  the darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid  the white paint would be too light  and in the winter wouldnt attract as much heat as needed 
light gray  the color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the summer to keep the dog cool  but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm  in the experiment  the color light grey had a temperature that was 21  deg  higher than the starting temperature of 24  deg   but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24  deg  and 30  deg  from the original temperature of 24  deg  
white  white would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42  deg  c  this would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would 
light gray  for the bog house not to be to cold or hot 
black  black was the highest tempature when under the lamp so if brandi and jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose black because black had an avrage of 53  deg  c insted of other averages like 48  deg  c 45  deg  c and 42  deg  c
white  i think that if you use a white paint then the dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would get hot so that why you shuld use white 
dark gray  during the summer the dog houses temp  would be 48  deg   this would keep it cool  during the winter the darker color will help keep the heat inside the dog house 
black  black attracts more heat
black  the black paint will trap more heat inside  it will be hotter in the doghouse than if brandi and jerry used dark grey  light grey  or white 
dark gray  the dark gray color is fine becuz its not to dark and its not too brigth  dark gary had a 48  deg  c avg and the darkest is black which had a 53  deg  c avg also the brightest which is white had a 42  deg  c avg
black  it would make the doghouse warm due to the dark color 
black  the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
white  white is the best color to paint the doghouse because  based on the experiment  dark colors absord heat and light colo rs dont  the hottest air temperature in the jar experiment  53  deg  c  was from the jar with the black lid  and the jar with the coolest air temperature  42  deg  c  was from the jar with the white lid  proving that light colors dont absorb heat and dark colors do 
white  painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesnt get too hot while its inside  white would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color  i know this because in the experiment  the average temperature for the whitelidded jar was less than any other colored lid 
white  the color might affect the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be cooler 
white  by painting the dog house white  it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler  this is proven because in each trial  white had the lowest temperature  for example  in the experiment  whites average tempurate was 42  deg   compared to blacks average  which was 53  deg   a huge difference
white  i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse  the data that brandi and jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11  deg  c cooler than the black lid
black  it will make it warmer for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy 
light gray  i think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid 
white  the color white will affect the inside of the doghouse because in the lid vs  air temperature inside glass jar table  it shows that the color white doesnt heat up as much as the other colors  the color white reflects the light making it stay cool  which is what you want for a doghouse 
black  i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color 
white  they might use white because it doesnt get hot as fast as the other colors do  in the data table it shows that the first trail was 42  deg  c the second trial was 43  deg  c the third was 41  deg  c and the fourth was 42  deg  c  for all the other colors the trials got higher than 43  deg  c therefore  the white would be best for a dog house because it doesnt get as hot 
light gray  it will make the dong house in between hot and cold
white  white attracts less heat so the dog will no be harmed on very hot days 
white  to design the dogs house i think that the painters should you used white paint  because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light so therefor the dark colors just continue to absorb all the light 
black  it will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm 
white  the color white would be the best to paint the doghouse because it will be kept cooler than black  which the average was 53 degree celcius  dark gray which the average was 48 degree celcius  ligh gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius  and the whites average was 42 degree celius  black absorbs the most heat  while white reflects 
white  this color would make the dog house 11  deg  c cooler than than if it was a black color  so the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house  in brandy and jerrys experiment the white lid was the coldest  and they said dark colors absorb more heat  so white would be an appropriate color 
light gray  light gray might affect the doghouse by having the averge temperature of 45  deg  c  so if it is cold outside it wont freeze the dog or if its too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot  black had the highest aveage of 53  deg  c  dark gray had the aveage of 48  deg  c  and white had the lowest average of 42  deg  c  the light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45  deg  c 
light gray  this color might bring the inside of the doghouse to a comfortable temperature  according to the results of the experiment  the colors were in this order  from the highest to lowest temperature   black  dark gray  light gray  white  dogs do not normally enjoy hot  stuffy enviornments  they pant uncontrollably when they are overheated  and get very uncomfortable  this light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated  but will also not allow himher to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature as white was resulted in the coldest temperature according to the experiment results 
white  i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color 
black  this color would keep the doghouse warm during the nights and cold days  and if it is a hot day then the dog will be outside anyways
black  black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat  in the lab  black had an average of 53  deg  c and white had an average of 42  deg  c 
black  black is a darker color so there forth it attracts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
dark gray  well  the dark gray would make it warmer  but not to warm  ampthey temperature would stay at one degree  so  its would be 48  deg  in there 
white  it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
black  black because the black had the highest number the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other color
white  coloring the doghouse white will give an effect by not making it hot like other colors  in the experiment  they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42  deg   the black lid was 53  deg   the dark gray was 48  deg   and lastly  the light gray was 45  deg   therefore  we can conclude that the white attracts the least sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less 
light gray  light gray because when the dog is sleeping in the dog house and its ranning he will get cold because it is white so they for light gray will keep it warm and cool at the same time for those winter days and the cold days with ran
black  the sun will be attracted to black and it will make the dog house really hot
white  darker colors absorb heat from light  so lighter colors reflect it 
light gray  it will wear 
white  white because it kept the inside of the jar the coolest so the dog wouldnt get to hot in the summer  the insidde of the b jar with the black lid had an average of 53  deg  c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42  deg  c
black  the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood 
white  the color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black  dark gray and light gray  because lighter colors dont absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do  for example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c while the inside tempeture of ajar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42  deg  c  the inside of the jar with the white lid was 11  deg  c less than the jar did with the black lid 
dark gray  it will be warm in the doghouse for the winter  but not to hot for the dog in the summer 
black  because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off 
light gray  it wouldnt be to hot to live in  for a dog  but it would be warm and provide heat 
white  white  because white paint adsorbse heat less than the darker colors  and you wouldnt want your dog to over heat 
light gray  light gray will keep the dog house warm in the winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog house because it is alight color aswel 
white  it would keep the dog cool enough to withstand the heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm 
black  having a black doghouse might affect the inside of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better  in brandi and jerrys experiment the average temperature for the black lid jar was 53  deg  c  5  deg  c more than the next warmest one  dark gray 
black  if they paint the dog house black the conditions in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they put the black lid on the jar  so that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color 
dark gray  the darker the color of the doghouse the hotter it will be  so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the winter you dont want it to be white  so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer it wont attract as much as the black would
 its depends on were they live if its a hot place then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture 
white  white would make the dog house cooler and more pleastent to live in 
dark gray  i would choose dark gray because in the summer it may become warm for the dog  so black would be too hot  in the winter black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside  so for an all around the year comfortable paint i would choose dark gray because its the median between them both 
white  ir afeeect other people to what they may have dont to othewers and atht jksdjoiauy dhsaj 3 hfgyunashgygajshu
light gray  dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold  the results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42  deg  c  in the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well  black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53  deg  c  however  even though according to the experiment  the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool  the experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid  but only by 3  deg  c  therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5  deg  c cooler than the jar with the black lid  the dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer  but remain warm in the winter 
light gray  it will let the energy go in and out   
black  because that way the dog wont be hot or cold  it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter 
black  black will absorb more heat  therefore keeping the dog warm throughout the year  the average temperature inside the jar with a black lid was 53 degrees celcius  while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower 
dark gray  dark gray would heat up the air for a dog to a comfortanble temerature and not make it to hot like the black lid or make it to cold like the light lid
black  because the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because  of the solar energy 
black  the color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter  the color black absorbs heat better than the other colors  the experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54  deg  c and the coldest for black was 52  deg  c  the least warmest was the color white  the highest temperature was 43  deg  c  the lowest was 41  deg  c  i chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter  white would not be as warm as black is 
dark gray  by painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it  i think this because on the results chart the black is a higher temp  than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp  in conclusion i think they should paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold 
white  the white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black53  dark gray48  light gray45  and white42 
white  white would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs  as seen on lid color vs  air temperature for each lid color table where it shows the average of the white lids temperture was 42   deg  c 
white  the darker colors absorb more energy so if you picked black then the temperture would increase in the air  for example in the experiment the tempeture went to 54  deg   and for the white lid it only went up to 41  deg  thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house 
white  it will let it be less hotter 
white  a white colored doghouse will make the air temperature warmer in warm temperature  but the light color will not make the temperature go up a lot  with the black lid color  the temperature of the air inside the jar was adn average of 53  deg  after ten minutes  the white jar was and average of 42  deg  after ten minutes  since both jars started at 24  deg   the temperature of the black jar increased 29  deg  while the temperature of the white only increased 18  deg   the darker the color of something  the more heat the object absorbs  that means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse  even though that doghouse will warm up as well 
dark gray  i would say dark gray because when the sun comes out you dont want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gray would work perfectly in my opinion 
white  the doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42  deg  while the average temperatures of the black  dark gray  and light gray doghouses were 53  deg   48  deg   and 45  deg  respectively 
black  it willbe hotter cose its hot
white  white had the lowest temperature so the doghouse wont get extremely hot 
light gray  it might be less hot than a darker lid because black absorbes the most heat 
white  brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse white  this is because in the summer  when the temperature outside gets hotter  the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog  that is because darker colors absorb more light ad heat energy 
dark gray  the dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which is not too cool but not too hot  48  deg    i know this because on the data table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the color that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same 
white  the white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid  the air temperature inside the jar was the lowest  it seemed that the lighter the color  the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was after 10 minutes  this would be the best color for a dog house because if you would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime  having a white painted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead 
white  painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly  while painting the doghouse a darker color will raise the temperature significantly  in the lid color vs  air temperature inside glass jar data table  the temperature inside the jar with the white lid  raised an average of 18  deg  c from the starting temperature after 10 minutes  the temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29  deg  c from the starting temperature after 10 minutes  if brandi and jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool  then they would paint the doghouse white  if they wanted the temperature to be warm  they would paint the doghouse black  i would paint the doghouse white 
black  more dogs like black
white  if they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less  damages or issues to the dog
light gray  the light gray so its not to hot and not to cold
light gray  i would choose dark gray because on a hot day  the dog can stay nice and cool  and on a cold day the color is still able to absorb some heat  the experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat than lighter so the dark gray color would be the best  also in the trials  the average temp of the jar is 48  deg  c so the dog would be nice and warm in the house 
white  the color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors  thats why in brandi and jerrys lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors 
white  i choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more cooler  i know this because in the investigation it said white had 42  deg  c which is the lowest while the black had 54  deg  c which is the highest 
white  the lighter color would help keep the doghouse cooler inside  for example  the jar with the white colored lid was cool er 42  deg  than the black lid 53  deg 
light gray  because it made a mild temperature in the jar
white  how this color might affect the doghouse is when a color is lighter like the color white  that color doesnt absorb al ot of heat like the color black  so when its going to be really hot outside  inside the doghouse it will be cool 
light gray  this would absorb more thermal energy while still keeping cool because of the lightns of the gray 
black  black will affect the doghouse because it wil make the inside hot 
light gray  the light gray would keep the dog house at a more even temp because its both alight and dark color so it would atrackt the right amount of sun light and repel just the right amount of sun light 
white  the doghouse should be white because it has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table  it will be warmer or colder than the other colors so the dog living in the doghouse wont be hot or cold 
dark gray  the color will affect the dighouse by not making it to cold and not making it to warm 
white  i would make the dog house white because white dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot 916
light gray  light grey would be a great color to use on a dog house because  the color would not obsorb a lot of heat and and it would not be to cold because grey is still a dark color that could obsorb heat  when needed 
white  white paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins  under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o  11 degrees colder than the hottest paint color of black the average of the black paints air was 53 
white  the inside wont be as hott 
dark gray  the best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the temperature inside of the doghouse wouldnt be too hot for the dog  but it wouldnt be too cold  it was 48  deg  c in the jar with a dark gray lid on average  that is more suitable for a doghouse than the black lid  which was 53  deg  c  or the white lid  which was 42  deg  c 
dark gray  dark grey because if you use this color the dog house will be about 48 degrees and the dog house will not be to cold
dark gray  the color  dark gray  would affect the doghouse because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature  this way  the doghouse would be around 48  deg   the doghouse would not be too hot  53  deg    as it would be with the color black  but the doghouse would not be too cold  42  deg    as it would be with the color white 
light gray  because the dogs liked their home and the dog feels comfortable 
light gray  light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the temerature would be just right 
black  if you use black paint then it will take in more heat because dark colors absorb more energy like they found out in the lab hot lamp the black was at least 5  deg  c hotter then all the other colors 
white  because it obsorb less heat and energy
white  it wil make it so the air inside of the doghouse will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot  i knowjthis because the data shows the averge temperature for white was 42  deg  c 
white  less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog 
black  this color would make the doghouse warmer because in the experiment the darker the color  the warmer it will be inside 
white  white is best in this situation  as long as its not cold out  white reflects heat  thus the husky or lab or what ever dog or wolf it is  stays cool and collect 
light gray  the color absorbs enough heat not to be cold in the winter  but not to much heat to be hot in the summer 
dark gray  it will take in heat in the winter and wont take as much in in the summer as black would 
white  white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
light gray  light gray is the best color for the dog house because it doesnt make the dog house too hot but it also doesnt make the dog house too cold  the black had an average temperature of 53  deg  c which is too hot for a dog in the summer  it needs to be at a relaxing temperature which is 45  deg  c for the light gray  if i were to choose the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in  the light gray color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his little house 
black  the black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer  keeping the dog warm at night  the average temperature for the black lid was 53  deg   while the white was 42  deg   the black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11  deg  higher than the white paint 
white  the black color  when it gets dark dogs will have a dark doghouse so i just picked white 
black  clack absorbs more heat energy  so it would make the doghouse a warmer place for the dog  the average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8  deg  c more than the other colored lids  that is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with 
white  porque es el que da mas inside de glass
black  if the color of the doghouse was black then it would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside  in the experiment it was 53  deg  c on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42  deg  c on average when the lid of the jar was white 
black  i think they should use blak beacause it would be warmer for the dog 
white  the darker colors will absorb heat faster than lighter colors 
black  black  because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog  and on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature  53  deg  c  or get a little colder  but not to cold for the animal 
dark gray  i chose the dark gray paint color because it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light gray paint  but cooler in the summer than the black paint would  the experiment supports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment made the inside temperature an average of 48  deg  c  while the highest average data  the black paint  was a temperature of 53  deg  c  too hot  and the lowest average data  the white paint  was 42  deg  c  too cold for the dog 
white  white would not attract as much heat as the other darker colors
light gray  light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse  light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldnt be too cold or too warm for a dog  a white doghouse was 42 degrees which might make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too warm  dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53  much too warm the refore light gray would be the best color 
white  if the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
black  if you see the doghouse black then you can see better because the color is black you can see black better in the after noon 
white  i would pick white paint to paint the dog house because according to the experiment white was the color that the inside of the jar would be less hot  accordig to brandi and jerrys data the white lid had a temperature 42  deg  c inside the jar and the black lid was 53  deg  c and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog house 
light gray  i would chose light gray because in the summer  a black house might overheat the dog  however in the winter a white house might be too cool  alight gray house would repel heat in the summer  and allow more heat in the winter 
dark gray  if brandi and jerry colored the doghouse white  it would not asorb the heatness like the color black  therefore  it would feel more comfortable for the dog when it is hot outside  the reason why black was to asorb heat  because in the data table it had higher degree then white  which had a lowest degree in temperature 
light gray  the color would keep the doghouse at a perfect temperature not to hot or not to cold
black  black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causing it to be warmer in their at night 
black  we can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat  knowing this information  for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse  brandi and jerry should paint the house black 
white  assuming that the location of the doghouse has a warm climate  the white paint color will be more likely to keep the temperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler  or lower  temperature  this can be said because the white paint color  on average  made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42  deg  c  compared to 53  deg  c for black paint  48  deg  c for dark gray paint  and 45  deg  c for light gray paint  it is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so that the dog  that stays inside the doghouse  doesnt overheat 
white  they should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse wont get as much heat absorbed  as shown in the table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature 
dark gray  the color will effect the dog house by keeping it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in the winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar the same temperature for all 3 trials which the average temperature was 48  deg  c 
dark gray  i think the best color for the dog house is d rrk gray  because its not the hotest color or the coldest which will help the dog stay cool but also warm  it showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48  deg  c for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time  also dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6  deg  c average 
white  it will keep it cooler due to the fact that white dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray  light gray and black  also  because blacks average  in  deg  c  was 53 dark grays average was 48  light grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42  leaving that white will leave the dog house cooler 
black  black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
black  black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within  out of all the colors of white  dark gray  light gray  black and white  black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53  deg  c while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42  deg  c  thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other  however  you must also consider where the doghouse is being placed  if the doghouse should be placed outdoors  black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold winters  if placed indoors  the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm 
white  white would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above  in the data table with black paint  the average was 53   deg  c   the white paint  the average was 42   deg  c   so that shows that if you go for light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it really hot then go for the dark colors 
black  1the dog will be feeling like fanetting  2the dog will gett thirsty  3the dog will breath reeally hard 
white  the color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature  based on the results from the experiment  the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white  so the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in 
dark gray  because dark gray color absorb more energy 
white  this color effects the dog house because it makes it cooler according to the hot lamp experiment in there experiment the white lid was the coolest 
white  the best color to paint the top of the doghouse would be white  in the experiment  on average the black lid absorbed 5 3  deg  c  dark gray48  deg  c  light gray45  deg  c  white42  deg  c  the black lid absorbed 11  deg  more heat than the white lid  by painting the top of the doghouse white  it decreases the amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse 
white  how white would affect the doghouse is that it would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse 
light gray  in there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use alight grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature 
dark gray  black because it will get to hot
light gray  light gray because it wont make the inside of the dog house to hot because the dog already has a large coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog house 
white  the lighter the color  the less heat will be inside the dog house  the darker the color  more heat will be inside the dog house
white  so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter 
dark gray  i chose dark gray because  where i live  it can get fairly cold  the dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and at night  without over heating the doghouse  and hopefully in the summer the dog will be able to run around and wont have to worry about getting to hot in the doghouse then  i think your question is too vague  it really depends on the climate and dog breed 
white  i would choose white because i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space  that hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldnt want my dog sitting in that  i would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white color as a paint for a doghouse 
white  based on the data  white had the lowest temperature average of 42  while others have an average of 45  48  and 53  it all depends on the dog you are getting  if its fur is dark  better to get light colors so it can be cooler 
black  this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son 
white  the color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot 
light gray  it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
white  white has less heat absorbtion  if the sun is out and it is hot  the dog house will still be cool inside white has temperature in the low 40s for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes  light gray has temperatures in the mid 40s  dark gray is high 40s  and black is low to mid 50s 
black  they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so black is the most affective color 
dark gray  the temperature will stay the same in the cold and hot weather  the temperature will never be too hot or too cold 
white  white would affect the doghouse because according to the results of the experiment  trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54  deg   dark gray made it 48  deg   light gray made it 44  deg   and white made it 42  deg   they should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest  that way the dog doesnt ov erheat 
white  the white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat 
white  white  because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids  and from the data table it shows that black  53degr ees  was the highest  and white  42degrees  was the lowest  so if they want a to paint the dog house  they should paint it white  do to  the tempa ture of the dog house wont be to hot for the dog to be in 
white  this color could keep the doghouse cool in direct sunlight  this could make it more comfertable for the animal 
white  i choose white because if the doghouse is out side  then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it 
black  the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy  black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and color of the lid it got an average of 53  deg  c  the lightest color  white  got an average of 42  deg  c 
dark gray  a dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it wont get too warm 
black  black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the white or the grays  the average for the black was 53  deg  c  and the white was 42  deg  c  that means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat 
white  with white the temperaturein the dog house would stay nice andd cool in the summer
white  the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors  i know this because in the experiment  the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29 
white  the doghouse will usually be cool inside even on sunny days because the light from the sun will reflect off of the dog house causing the light to not enter it and make the transformation into thermal  heat  energy 
white  if the dog house was white the inside would be cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42  deg  c and blacks average is 53  deg  c
white  that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time  i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42  so thats more than a 10  deg  c difference 
light gray  light gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white 
black  it will keep the dog house warmer because the black attracks heat
black  the color black because it would be warm in the doghouse  since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep the dog warm rather than cold 
white  i think the dog house should be white  because in the experiment  white didnt get very hot  the highest temperature was 43  deg  c and the lowest was 41  deg  c 
dark gray  if brandi and jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons  the color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48  deg  c  that makes the temperature of the doghouse in general  not to hot and not to cool based on the jar experiment 
white  white will make the doghouse cooler than darker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42  deg  c and inside the black lid it was 53  deg  c  that is 11  deg  c warmer 
black  if he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
white  it would make it cooler in there for the dog  because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then darker colors  for example  the average for the black lid was 53  deg  c  but the average for the white lid was only 42  deg  c  which is a lot less  so i think brandi and jerry should go with painting their doghouse white 
white  a white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside  i know this because in the experiment the black lid got to be the hottest at 54  deg  c well white was the coolest at 42  deg  c  white was also cooler then dark gray at 48  deg  c and light gray at 44  deg  c  so white would be the coolest for the doghouse 
black  the dog house if painted black will be warmer because the color black atracts heat 
light gray  the light grey will effect the doghouse by making it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black  white and grey 
light gray  it can make it hot but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as black or dark gray
black  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs  haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
white  brandi and jerry predicted that the darker the lid color  the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar  becuase darker colors absorb more energy  their hypothesis was correct  this is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after three tenminute trials was 53 degrees but the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three tenminute trials was 42 degrees  because black was the darkest color of the lid  it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest  and vice versa for the white lid   thus  because we dont want the doghouse to be overhe ated  the best color to paint it would be white because white would absorb the least heat 
black  the color black will affect the doghouse by making it a warmer environment for the dog  plus if it is a cold winter  the doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer  the data table shows that using the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12  deg  higher then the white lid  about 10  deg  higher in temperature than the light gray lid  and about 6  deg  higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial  the average temperature was 53  deg  c for the black lid  the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48  deg  c  the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45  deg  c  and the average temperature for the white lid was 42  deg  c  it shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer 
black  is to dark
white  white would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42  deg  c compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53 25  deg  c  making the dog house a cooler place to live 
black  if the doghouse is black than the inside will be warmer when there is sun shining on it  so the dog will stay warm
light gray  light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat  though not as much as black  so it would not be incredibly hot  but it would still be warmer than white  also  it wouldnt be as cold as the white  but would be cooler than the black  so light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quite cold  and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog 
white  the color white reflects most of the suns he at  while the color black absorbs most of the suns heat 
white  the best paint color for the doghouse would be white  inside of the doghouse  the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray  the average temperature for the black lid was 53  deg  c  but for the white lid  it was 42  deg  c  the white lid made the air 11  deg  cooler than the black lid 
white  white cause black makes heat worse and so i chose white because every dog house is white because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm 
black  the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy 
white  white will ceep the doghouse cooler
black  black will affect the dog house buy keeping heat in
black  brings heat in the dog house
white  white doesnt attract heat but black  dark gray and light gray do  so the dog would be kept cool 
dark gray  dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold 
dark gray  dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light 
white  white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
light gray  if you paint the dog house black then the in side will always very hot  then when the sun is shining on it just like in the lab it says the the darker the color the greater the increase in air inside the doghouse  so i would not choose black to be the color for the dog house  i would pick light grey because it is dark but at the same time it is alight color  when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house it will be warm but cool at the same time because it is alight color and alight color does not obsorve as much heat 
light gray  if the doghouse is light gray then in the winter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature 
light gray  based off the results  you would want this color because it doesnt attract to much heat  and it wouldnt be to cold at the same time 
light gray  i think light gray would be the best because it wouldnt be too hot or cold
white  the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color  but black is a dark color so it will get hotter  in the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on 
light gray  i choose light gray because light gray isnt too light and is not too dark  light gray will cause the dog house to be at a comfortable temperature  if it was white  it would be too cold and if it was black  then it would be too hot  in the experiment  light gray ha dan average temperature of 45  deg  c while white had 42  deg  c and black had 53  deg  c 
white  brandi and jerry should use white paint for there dog house because in the investagation the white paint color only had a 18  deg  increase as black paint had a 29  deg  increase  the diffren ce between the two paints tempurture was 11  deg  
white  white would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat  in summer  you wouldnt want the dog house to be overheated  the white color had an average of 42  deg  c while the black color was 53  deg  c  this is a difference of 11  deg  c between the two colors 
black  the color black would make the house warmer on the inside 
white  i think that white would be a good color  because in brandi and jerrys expeirement  white gave a cooler temperature than the others  so the doghouse could be colder than warmer 
dark gray  this color would allow the house to collect some heat without it being to hot  since gray is lighter then black but not to light 
light gray  this color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days  on average  the heat inside the jar with alight gray  45  deg  c  was cooler than that of black  53  deg  c  and dark gray  48  deg  c 
white  so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white 
light gray  it depends on the dog  if the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because it doesnt obsorb that much heat energy  but if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enough heat in the doghouse 
dark gray  dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog  in the jar the air tempature insde the jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48  there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
white  white could be a color for the doghouse  it wouldnt make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is  also  in the experiment  white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors  42  deg  c  43  deg  c  41  deg  c  and 42  deg  c  where as the other colors  black  dark gray  and light gray  all had higher temperatures  the temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54  deg  c  the color black  to the lowest temperature  41  deg  c for the color white 
black  the color black is going to make the doghouse more warm  because darker colors absorb more energy 
black  the darker the color is the hotter the doghouse would be  the lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
white  it will keep the temp  in the 40  deg  area  c  deg   and not burn up the dog inside the doghouse 
white  the color white might affect the doghouse because the dog wont get too hot in the summer because the weather is warmer in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four  white was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees 
light gray  choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color  it wouldnt be to hot or to cold for the dog  during the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature of 53  deg  c  the white lid created a temperature of 42  deg  c  choosing the light gray color would be a good medium 
white  white might affect the inside of the dog house because  it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature  i think white is the best paint color to use because  it had the lowest temperatures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy 
white  white would make the dog house less hot  the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1  2  and 3 
white  becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
white  the color white wouldnt absorb as much energy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldnt become too warm  with a black lid  the jar was an average temperture was 53  deg  c after 10 minutes  with the white lid the temperature was an average of 42  deg  c  this shows that the lighter the color  the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house  something to warm would not be suitable for a dog  and therefore making white the right color 
light gray  light gray how it might affect the doghouse is that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color might get really hot well the dog house might get really hot 
light gray  i think light gray will be the best for the dog because in the summer it will not too warm  hot  and winter not too cold  since the data prove that the darker the object the more it will absorb the energy which gain or lose heat based the color  and since the aver age data of light gray is about in the middle which was 45  deg  c 
white  a white color would keep it cooler because  according to the data  white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degrees celcius  while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degrees celcius 
light gray  based on the data i think light grey would be the best color  i think that because it would make the doghouse warm for the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer 
light gray  alight gray would make the dog house warm but not too cold like when it is raining you dont want to have a white dog house  the average for the black colored lid was 53  deg  c which is too hot and the dark gray was 48  deg  c which is still a little too hot and the average for the light gray is 45  deg  c and the white was 42  deg  c so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends on the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe even want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair you would want a white dog house 
white  the white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse  meaning it would be great for summer  but if you want the warmer house in the winter  the black doghouse should do the trick 
black  really black 
white  if you use white paint color to paint a dog house  it would be the best choice to keep the dog cool during a hot day  in the experiment out of the 4 tested lid colors  white held out to be the one with the lowest temperature 
white  this color might affect the doghouse because since white doesnt absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool enough for the dog to be in  darker color absorbs more energy and since white is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbed 
white  this will help the dog so it wont get hot in the summer 
dark gray  the color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside  but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse  dark gray will attract at an average about 48  deg  c of heat  the black color has to much heat about 53  deg  c  and the color white has to little of heat at about 42  deg  c  so therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse 
black  the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the lid was white it was 42 dagrees
white  the color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it wont be to hot for the dog  as shown in the data white is the coolest  the average for a black lid is 53  deg  c  the dark gray lid is 48  deg  c the light gray lid is 45  deg  c and the white lid is 42  deg  c  therefore the white is the coolest and it wont get that hot for the dog 
white  with a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is 
black  the color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because  you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer  there will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature 
black  it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
white  the air temperature will be lower on average  because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the lowest 
light gray  this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it  but not overheating the doghouse 
white  white because white reflects sun and u want it to be cold in a dog house for a dog
dark gray  dark gray would be a good color because it wouldnt be too cold nor to hot  in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48  deg  c
white  the dog house would stay cooler because white doesnt attract the that much heat 
white  the color white had the lowist temp at the end of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
dark gray  it wold make it cooler in the sumer but warmer in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat 
white  white would be better for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did  white only absorbed an average of 42  deg  c  where black absorbed an average of 53  deg  c 
dark gray  dark gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isnt too warm nor too cold  darker colors attract more heat than light so dark gray wouldnt be too hot or cold  in an air temperature expirement  four colors were measured black  dark gray  light gray  and white  the data measured black as 53  deg  c  dark gray as 48  deg  c  light gray 45  deg   and white 42  deg  c  dark gray as you see isnt too warm  neither too cold  making it the best color for the doghouse 
white  using white paint would make the doghouse colder than if they used black paint  as was shown by the table  the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53  deg  c  while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42  deg  c  the jar with the black lid was 11  deg  c warmer than the jar with the white lid  thus  using white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint  and brandi and jerry should use white paint 
white  white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light
white  the black was 9  deg  c warmer then the white colored paint  the black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog  the white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer 
white  painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11  deg  c  the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53  deg  c where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42  deg  c 
white  white you be the best color for brandi and je rrys dog house because acording to their experiment  white absorbs less energy than darker colors  therefor brandi and jerrys dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather 
dark gray  it wont be too hot or too cold in the dog house 
white  bright colers reflect the light so the dog will not get so hot 
black  the color black would keep the the dog warm 
light gray  the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it would be cold for him in the winter  so keeping it at alight darker color you ahve a mixeture of the 2 
light gray  alight gray paint on the doghouse might provide some heat in the winter  while not making it too hot in the summer  that is shown by the data  in the 20  deg  c increase in temp  dark gray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer  because of the average increases of 24  deg  c for dark gray and 29  deg  c for black  a white paint would not provide much heat during the winter  shown by the meager 18  deg  c increase  however  on the other hand this experiment isnt closley applicable  the doghouse would not likely be made of glass  and sealed off from outside air curculation  also  the sun burns many different gases  providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp  in addition to being brighter  the doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof  made of wood and shingles   a note you could have interchangable roofs on the doghouse  one of each color  and circulate them during the year  with white in the summer and black in the winter  and the other two scattered between 
white  i think it would be white because then when it is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then it would be when the dog house is white 
light gray  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an average of 45  deg  celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3  deg  celsius making an 8  deg  celsius difference between the two 
black  the color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus  brandi and jerry should paint th dog house black  according to the results from the experiment  the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53  the darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy 
black  the black paint might make the dog house absorb more heat  making the dog house warmer  i think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results  the black paint retained the most heat in the glass jar 
white  because white dose not atract anything
white  white would be better because during the summer it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
dark gray  it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
light gray  light gray would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray one would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold 
light gray  in all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature  in the warmer weather the color wont absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool  during the colder seasons  the dog will still have a warmer area  and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm 
white  the white paint color would be cooler because on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot  so the dog would just go in his dog house  the white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat  ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun  the experiment tells it all  the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40  deg  c as the other colors went up to 45  48  and 53  the dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest  coming to a solution the white paint would be the best to use for a dog house 
black  white would keep the doghouse the coldest  around 40   if the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties  if the doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties  if the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties  if the doghouse was black it would be in the low fifties  white would reflect the light and not heat up the doghouse as much as any other color 
white  it does not atract as much lite as a darker color
black  because black absorbs heat more then the other colors
white  the color white absorbs less heat therefore will reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse 
black  the color black prevents more cold and absorbs more thermal energy  making it a warmer place for the dog 
light gray  light gray might affect the inside of the dog house because dark colors attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot  but then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold  so the average temperature for light gray is a good temperature for an living environment 
light gray  painting the doghouse light gray would keep the doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter  i know this because the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar  the cooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
white  white becuase if you live in a hot place the dog house will be less hot because white reflect most of the light off of the dog house 
light gray  this color will affect the doghouse for the best  the darker color keeps in heat but sometimes heat isnt always good  i found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air temperature but wont be to hot for the dog 
light gray  i think light gray would work the best because  if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside  and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside 
dark gray  if they painted the doghouse dark gray  then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials 13 the temperatures stayed at 48  deg  c 
white  the black would affect the doghouse because the sun is attracted to black  so if the sun is beating down on the doghouse to long it is possible that the dog could over heat of get very sick  something eles could happen to the dog that is sleeping in the doghouse 
black  this color could possibly make the dog house warmer 
white  it will affect the doghouse by making it nice and fresh inside the doghouse
white  brandi and jerry would have to paint the doghouse white because the sun doesnt make alot of wite things hot  cause on the data table it shows that the color white doesnt effect the sun alot since its a lighter color 
white  white does not absord as much light as a darker color making the inside of the doghouse not as warm as it could be  in the experiment  the lowest temperature average was white with 42  deg   the next temperature was light gray with 45  deg   after that it just goes up higher
black  i would pick black this color will effect the dog house by keeping the dog house warm my support is that in the data table it shows that the average temperature for the color black inside a glass jar was 53  deg  c and the lowest temperature was white and whites av rage data was42  deg  c  dark grey and light grey had a median of 48  deg  c for dark grey and 45  deg  c for light grey this shows that the black color would keep the dog the most warmest
dark gray  using dark gray would make the dog house an average of 48  deg  c  if you used black it would be too hot in the summer but if you used white it would be too cold in the winter  and the reason why i didnt choose light gray is because the dog would most likely be in the dog house at night when its colder and not so much during the day  especially in the summer 
light gray  by using this color for the doghouse it will have the perfect temperature inside the doghouse because it will be about 45  deg  inside  which isnt too cold or too hot and that might make the dog happy 
white  if the color of the dog house was white then the air temperature inside of it would be cooler than if the color was black  the averge temp  for the color black was 53  deg  c  and the average temp  for the color white was 42  deg  c  the difference between them is 11  deg  
white  white paint would keep the doghouse cool  you know this because white had the lowest average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp 
white  it dose not absorb the light as much
black  i say it should be black first of all because  lesser air will go inside the doghouse  since its ah more darker color and pluz it has an average of 54  deg  in average of heat inside a glass jar 
dark gray  the dog house will be hot due to the absorbst ion of heat from the color of the house  this will help the dog stay warmer during cold nights and the winters 
white  it will keep the heat out of the doghouse because white reflects heat and will keep the doghouse cool  i know this because of how the white jar heated up the slowest in the experiment 
black  black could affect the inside of the dog house because it will keep the dog house very warm so the dog wont get cold  i think this is true because according to the data the average temperature of a black color was 53  deg  c  which was the high data and the average temperature for the white color was only 42  deg  c  which is the low data  and the black temperature was 11  deg  warmer then the white temperature  so that means the black color will keep the dog warm 
black  if they paint the doghouse black then the dog could sleep in it overnight because of the warmth  the average temperature of the black jar was 53 degrees while the white jar was only 42 degrees 
white  dogs have a lot of fur to keep them warm so on a summer day they want to cool down  black is not a good chose because it asbordes a lot heat white does not  the color white will affect the dog house by being less hot then a black dog house will be 
dark gray  its would be about an average temperature  its not 2 hot or 2 cold 
dark gray  dark gray might affect the doghouse because it would warm up the dog without the dog getting to hot 
light gray  this cler would keep the dog house cool and keep a little warmpth in side
black  this color will keep the dog house warmer because it has a lower albedo  also in the experiment it had the highest of the average tempertures with 53  deg  
dark gray  tgfyfgfgccghjhjhgcgtchfhjfgfcc
white  from the results i would pick white because it was the coolest  as in temperature  that way the dog would be able to stay in a place thats not to hot and it provide protection from the sun th e lighter colors absorb less heat other than the darker colors so it shou ldent be that hot so they should paint the dog house white or any other lighter color but not the darker colors 
black  it wont
white  the white color will be the best because it is not as dark as black and white absorbs less heat than black  the dog house will be about the same temperature as the outside with the white paint  the showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the other darker colors 
black  having a black doghouse would make the doghouse warmer on the inside  in brandi and jerrys experiment  using a black lid had an average of 53  deg  c  while the othere lighter colors had ave rages of 48  45  and 42  deg  c  therefore  using black would be the best choice for a doghouse color 
light gray  if the doghouse was black or dark gray it might get to hot for the dog  if it was white it might be to cold for the dog so i decided that ligh gay was a good color 
white  the color white might effect the doghouse by causing the air temperature to be low in the summer since lighter colors obsorb less energy this is proven because a black lid averaged 53  deg  c and the white lid averaged a 42  deg  c  wich is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature 
white  i choose white for the colopr of the dog house  because that way it wont be so hot for the dog in the experiment brandi and jerry found the lighter the color  the less sun it atracts 
light gray  i would use light gray becuase its more on the cooler side for tempature and it wont over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house 
white  it will keep the inside of the doghouse from getting to warm during the summer 
light gray  it might fit because black wouldnt go eit the dog if the dog is alight color then alight gray if the dog is a drak color then drak gray would match him but the draker color the more they die it would be better if the doghouse was light gray because the lighter c olors dont make you sweat more
black  the dog house will not affect the dog house the black paint for the doghouse will keep it cool 
white  white would be a good color beacause it would make the dog house be fresh inside not so hot  acording to the data table white got the lowest average air tempature for how hot it gets but black got the most highest 
white  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house white because the jar with the white lid had the lowest temperature inside the jar  and its average was 42  deg  c  this way the inside of the dog house will stay cool and not get to hot 
white  i think that if they were building a dog house they should use a white paint color  because then the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter 
white  the wite paint will keep the dog house cooler  because in the experiment  the white paint had the lowest tempurature after ten minuutes  being 11 degrees cooler than the black paint  with at emp of 54 degrees 
dark gray  dark gray was the most consistant energy absorber  with an average of 48  deg  c the dog house will not be too cold or hot and is capeable of maintaing an consistent temperature all year long 
white  i choose the color white because if it is sunny day outside and the dog wants some shade he will go in the dog house because the white does not attracted energy as much as black  the dog house will be nice and cool for the dog 
white  it would stay cooler than a darker one would because it doesnt absorb energy like a darker one would 
light gray  using the light gray paint would be good because its still dark to the point where it will collect energy but not a whole lot to the point where the dog is dieing from the heat  but not light enough to the point where the dog isnt getting any energy from the sun 
white  the color of the dog house could affect the temperature makeing the dog house cooler  this is true because in the experiment the white colored jar was the coldest with and average of 42  deg  c 
light gray  the color  light gray  will make the doghouse cool in the summer and still keep it a little warm in the summer 
white  white will make it cooler in there so when its sunny out the dog can go in there and wont burn up  after 10 minutes the white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means its cooler then the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees
black  the color might affect the outside of the dog house because in the summer it might get lighter and the winter it might get darker
white  white would be the best color because white will keep the inside of the dog house at the coolest temperature  in the experement  the black lid caused the inside of the jar to be at an average of 53  deg  c and the white lid caused it to be an average of 42  deg  c  if the outside was black the dog house would be too hot and if it is white the house will be cool enough for the dog to live in 
white  the inside of the dog house after being painted white might make the doghouse be colder  in the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42  deg  c  in trial 3 it had 41  deg  c  the average temperature of white was 42  deg  c the lowest average out of every color 
white  the best paint color for the doghouse is white because the temperature is not too hot when put under light  black would not be a suitable color for the doghouse because its average temperature under a lamp for ten minutes is 53  deg  c  which is too hot  white paint however has an average of 42  deg  c when put under a lamp for ten minutes  this means that with a white doghouse  the dog wouldnt over heat 
dark gray  the color gray would absorb only some of the lights enery for heat  not as much as black and since dogs have thick coats you dont want it to be too hot inside the doghouse  also it gets cold in the winter and brandi and jerrys dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would be neccesary to be at 0least somewhat warm in the doghouse  thats why gray would be the best color 
white  because in the summer  the white color will d eflect the suns heat  keeping the doghouse 10  deg  cooler than if you would paint it black  because in the experiment  the air temperature inside of the jar with the white lid stayed in the low 40s  while the jar with the black lid stayed in the lowmid 50s  proving the white deflects he at  while black asorbs it 
white  the doghouse will stay cooler on the inside 
white  the color white would effect the doghouses inside in away were it would absorb less heat therore it would be cooler in the inside of the dog house 
black  the darker color will keep most of the heat in the dog house than the color white would  the increase of the heat is because of the darker color in the dog house 
white  the paint color that i choose is white i chos se this color because it will not make the inside of the dog house as hot  the color might affect the inside of the dog house because white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color would  in the summer in stead of it getting up to 53  deg  c with black paint it will be a cooler 42  deg  c with the white paint
black  the black paint will keep the dog warm inside the doghouse during winter  just like how the black jare lid heated the air in the jar 11  deg  c higher than the jarwith a white lid 
light gray  the doghouse wouldnt be too cold or too hot  i got this data from the table they made of all the adverages
light gray  the light gray is a good color to choose because it wont be too hot in the summer and wont be too cold in the winter  the light gray was the 2nd coldest jar 
white  the color will keep the dog cooler and will not get the dog really hot in the expirement it says that it got down to 4 1  deg  c and the lowest for others was 44  deg  c 
white  the temperatur would be lower  because in the experiment the white lid had a temperature 11  deg  below that of the black lid
white  i think white becaause white reflects the sun so its not as hot inside the dog house 
white  to keep the dog house cooler a black dog house
white  because black attracts more heat than white
dark gray  because the results of their experiment showed that a dark color attracts more sunlight  it would be best to have dark gray paint  although  dark colors would be a very bad idea for hot sunny days because it would become extremely hot inside of the doghouse and the dog would begin to dehydrate and would have to have its waterdish re filled two times a day  but  with alight gray paint on the doghouse  the dog would be able to stay cool during summertime
white  the color white is the best choice because it will keep the doghouse colder  a white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 degrees 
white  this color will affect the dog by keeping the dog cool in the summer becaus the darker the lid color  the greater the increase in air tempeture   
light gray  this color would effect the dog house by keeping the air warm and cold so it would be the right temerature 
white  i would make it much cooler for the dog in his new dog house 
white  th white paint will keep the dog house cool when it gets hot outside
white  the color white might affect the inside of the dog house to be cooler  the average of the three trials for white was lower than the average of the other colors  white was 3  deg  c cooler than light gray and as much as 11  deg  c cooler than the black 
white  because white draws the least amount of energy
dark gray  the best color to paint the doghouse would be dark gray  because dog houses are usually meant to keep dogs warm  dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside warm  but not hot  therefore the dog would be most comfortable with the color dark gray 
white  if the doghouse was painted white  the inside of the doghouse wouldnt get to hot for the dog  this is because in the data table the average temerature for the light gray lid color was 42  deg  c  also  if the doghouse was painted black or any of the other c olors  the dog would possibly get to hot because they are darker colors that absorbs more energy 
dark gray  it will warm the doghouse  and help the doghouse contain a consistant tempeture  at 54  deg  c
white  white will keep the dog house cooler because in the expirament white had the lowest average temperature when it was put under the light for 10 minutes 
white  i think the best paint color for the doghouse is white  i believe that since white is the lighest color of paint they have  it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler  the lighter the color  the less heat it will asorb  in the data  the average temperature of the air inside the glass jar when the lid was white was 42  deg  c  for black  the darkest color lid they had  the average temperature of the air was 53  deg  c  thats a total difference of 11  deg  c 
black  the color black would keep the dog house warmer 
black  black is a good color to use because it absorbs heat  it would make the inside of the dog house warm  much like the hot lamp experiment  in the lab the lamp became hot because the black lid absorbed heat from the lamp  i think the black paint will absorb heat from the sun and make the dog house warm inside 
white  this color would be best because it would not get as hot as a darker color such as black making it better suited for the dog
black  it will make the dog house warmer 
light gray  they should paint it light gray because  that color attracts heat but not so much that it would get so hot in there in the summer  and not too cold in the winter 
dark gray  this color might affect the doghouse by absorbing energy from the sun but you dont want black because you dont want it to hot for the dog 
light gray  it might make it look not as good but it will also be cooler because black lets the heat in not out  it will also be lighter inside at night 
black  i would choose black for the paint color because the black paint would absorb the heat energy from the sun and heat up the inside of the doghouse  the black lid had an average tempurature of 53  deg  c  which was the highest average tempurature out of all the lids  and the white had a tempurature of 42  deg  c  which was the lowest  they had a difference of 11  deg  c  meaning that the black paint would keep the doghouse warmer 
white  i say white because is attracs less hot
white  the color white might affect the doghouse because inside the doghouse the temperature will be lower than if using the paint color to be black 
white  white does not absorb as much energy as the other colors so the doghouse would be colder inside 
black  i chosed black because it will keep the house warm because on the table it clearly states that black absorbs more energy
light gray  when the dog house gets dirty it wont show the parts that are dirty because its the color black
light gray  the light gray paint color would be the best because of the fact that if the dog was in the dog house it would not be too hot nor too cold  the data shows that the average tempreaure of the pain is as follows black53  deg  c dark grey48  deg  c light grey45  deg  c white42  deg  c so you see that with the ligth grey it still will absorbe some light  so it wont be to hot or to cold in there    the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because to much heat for an animal is not good and so it to little heat 
dark gray  dark gray was the only color that didnt either decrease or increase in temperature during the hot lamp experiment  if the built a dog house dark gray the inside of the dog house wouldnt over heat 
white  they should use white as a color because it will not be as hot in the dog house than with a black dog house darker col ors asborb energy and lighter color dont so white would be a good choice 
white  the color white would affect the doghouse better because the doghouse will stay cooler 
white  it will keep it the coolest out of all the co lors  the temp for white was 41 to 43 while the other colrs were rangeing to 44 to 54  deg 
light gray  i think that light gray would be best because it attrack some heat so during the winter it will be warm  then later  during the summer it will take in some heat but it wont take in enough to heat the dog up alot so he will stay at a pretty well kept temperature 
white  it will keep it cooler
white  white would be the best color for the doghouse because white absorbs less energy which would make the doghouse cooler for the dog  according to the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage air temperature of 42  deg  c while the black lid had an average air temperature of 53  deg  c 
white  brandi and jerry should paint thier doghouse white because the inside of the doghouse will stay cool even during the summer  the data shows that the white lids average heat temperture was about 42 c and the black was about 53 c  white was 11 degrees cooler 
black  with black paint the dog would have a warmer dog hose because black absorbs heat  in the experiment the temperature for the black lid was always the highest 
black  that color would provide the warmest environment for the dog in the doghouse  because the black paint would create the warmest air temperature  in the experiment  the jar with the black lid reached an average of 53  deg   which was 5  deg  more than the next highest temperature   48  deg  
black  it would effect in the heat because it would be warmer
white  the white house wouldbe better becauseit reflects light way better than black because it absorbs the light  causing it to get hotter
white  white would keep it cooler in the doghouse longer 
white  it will let the dog cool down on a hot day faster 
white  the average temperature from the glass jar experiment for the color white was 42 degrees  this is the lowest temperature out of the four colors  black  dark gray  light gray and white   using the color white would reflect the suns heat  causing the doghouse to be cool and not overheat  therefore  creating a safe doghouse habitat 
black  fdddfddf
white  the color will effect the dog house by keeping it cooler than the other colors because in the expiriment the white lid always had the lowest temperature 
dark gray  i believe that the dark gray would be a good paint color for the dog house because depending on where they live  that dog house woudnt be too hot  nor cold
light gray  the color will effect by having black and white mix because black brings heat and white is cooling color and mix them the dog house would be warm
black  after awhile the doghouse color might fade out 
dark gray  the color i chose till make the dog house warm but not to hot and dark gray stayed the same temperature at 48 for all 4 trials
dark gray  when the heat stays the same outside it will stay the same inside too 
black  using black paint color on the dog house will increase the temperature inside the dog by a few degrees  making it more comfortable for the dog 
light gray  the light gray might affect the doghouse but not too much because the light gray is almost at about room temperature  if you put black in there  it will be too hot  if you put white in there it might be too cold 
white  by making the doghouse white  the air inside the doghouse would be cooler than with any other color  in the experiment lid color vs  air temperature inside glass jar  the jar with the white lid was only an average of 42  deg  c after 10 minutes of heating  the jar with the black lid  however  was an average of 53  deg  c after 10 minutes of heating  the jar with the white lid was an average of 11  deg  c cooler than the jar with the black lid  therefor  the color white will make the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the doghouse 
black  it will make it hot in the dog hopuse
white  the color white would make the dog house absorb less heat and make it cooler  acording to the experiment black got 53  deg  c and white got 42  deg  c so it should do the same with the dog house 
black  i think balck so it willl keep it insolated and warm for the dog
white  i would choose black because in the lid color vs  air temperature inside glass jar table it showed that white was colder than black and the rest of the darker colors  for example the average for white was 42  deg  c and the average for black was 5 3  deg  c 
white  i would pick a white dog house because the white jar lid had the least amout of tempature increase  it only had about a an 18  deg  c increese while the black jar lid had a 29  deg  c increase 
white  white will reflect the heat so the dog house will be cool
white  the white panit because if you panit it a dak er color the results would be a hoter dog house and the resluts for a white dog house would be a cooler house 
black  how it can affect is that when is reallly hot outside the dogshouse can get really warm or like hot cause the sun is absorbing more energy 
dark gray  i think that brandi and jerry should use the color dark gray because if its summer and its really hot then it wont be to hot for the dog and wen its winter the dog can still be worm inough be cause the air inside in ajar like it shows in lid color vs  air temperature inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not to hot or to warm is dark gray and light gray so eather of them is fine because u wouldnt want the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
white  it will keep the doghouse cool and not hot  when brandi and jerry put the white lid on  the average temperature inside the jar was 42  deg  c  when they put the black jar on  the average temperature was 53  deg  c 
black  black because the color black atracs the heat and it gets realy hot 
white  if the doghouse was white the temperature in the doghouse would be so much cooler than if the doghouse was black  white would be best for the doghouse because you would not want it to be too warm white would fit the best 
white  white color will deflec more sunlight
white  white will not affect the doghouse because in the results in the experiment  it shows that white was the lowest temperature than all the temperatures of different lid colors 
black  it will be warmer for the dog
white  white would be the best choise because it attracts less heat as shown in the experiment the jar with the white lid only got up to 43  deg  cat the highest  and the black lid got up to 54  deg  cat the highest  and the dark grey and light grey were inbetween 
white  painting the doghouse white would make it cooler inside the doghouse  i know this because the average temperature for the whitelidded jar was 42  deg  c and the average temperatures for the other colored jars were all equal to or above 45  deg  c 
white  because it has the least amount of air pressure
black  painting your dog house this color will affect the inside by making it hotter is what i get from the chart and the results the kids who did this project 0
light gray  light gray doesnt asorb as much heat as black or dark gray  which would help keep the doghouse cool in the summer time  it also asorbs some heat  at least more than white  which would help keep the doghouse from getting too cold in the winter  this makes it the optimal paint to use when designing a doghouse 
white  it will keep the doghouse cool 
light gray  if they use light grey then the doghouse will stay cooler because if the color of the paint is dark then it will absorb more heat as it did in the lamp experiment 
white  i think white because in the summer time the dog house is not to hot for the dog house and warm air can come inside the dog house door to make the inside a little wwarmer 
white  the color white would reflect the light on the house  instead of absorbing it like the black would  keeping the house cool inside 
white  the white one will reflect more heat than the other colors
black  i would chose a black for the doghouse beacus e the air temperature would be hotter  therefore keeping the dog warmer in the winter time  i know this because in brandi and jerrys experiment  when the lid was black  the average air temperature was 53  deg  celsius  and when the lid was white  the average air temperature was 42  deg  celcius 
black  they should use black paint for their doghouse  in the experiment  the iar inside the jar was 5  deg  c warmer than the second warmest color the jar with the black lid was 53  deg  c 
white  it would keep the doghouse cool in the summer  after ten minutes the jar with the white lid was on average  only 42  deg  c  the jar with the black lid however had an aver age of 53  deg  c after ten minutes  this would be much too hot for the dog 
black  using black paint it will increase the tempat ure in the house so that their dog will stay warm
white  the color white does not absorbed energy from the sun  the color will make the dog house cooler instead of if you make the top black it will be as hot as an oven inside the dog house 
dark gray  my color is dark gray it might effect the inside because its gonna make it look scary in there
black  it would increase the temperature of the doghouse  especially when close to light  because darker colors make more heat  for ecample  when brandi and jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colo rs  black had the highest amount of heat  this is mostly because its an energy transfer  when light hits darker colors  it turns in to th ermal and or heat energy 
light gray  light gray could effect the tempature of the doghouse because draker colors absorb more heat than light colors do  if brandi and jerry were to paint the dog house black  the house would absorb too much heat since in the data the average was 53   deg  c   if you chose dark gray the average tempatrure was 48   deg  c  which could still be too warm  if you chose light gray  its average was 45   deg  c  which is right in the middle of being warm and cold and if you were to use white  the average was 42   deg  c  which could be too cold in the winter time  therefore  using the light gray could help keep the doghouse warm and cool and the same time 
light gray  in the winter the dog might get cold so you make it a sort of light color so it can stay warmer  in the summer it will be hot and the dog will want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light color
dark gray  drak gray will not over heat the dog or change its temperature
light gray  light gray would atract more energy than white which would keep it warmer but it would also stay cooler than black or dark gray 
light gray  i think that the best color for a dog house would probably be light grey  that way inside the dog house wouldnt be too hot or too cold  if the dog house was white  inside the dog house would probably be too cold since white doesnt absorb as much energy  i wouldnt paint the dog house black though because it might get too hot  same with dark grey  so light grey would be the best color for a dog house 
white  since the color whites average was 42  deg  c  the coolest temperature   it would be the best choice  since white doesnt get as much heat  the dog in the doghouse would be cooler than in a darker colored doghouse 
white  choose white because it wont absorb much heat like black does 54  deg  will make the dog house too hot  white is good because its a nice 41  deg 
white  becuase white gathers less energy which will make it cooler inside than any of the other colors 
black  using black paint to paint a doghouse would absorb more heat  as the data from the experiment shows  in the experiment  the jar with the black lid heated up to 53  deg  on average  while white only heated up to 42  deg  on average 
white  white is the best choice of color because the average temputre was 42 so comparing that to the black which is 53 the dog house would be cooler with white pant
white  on the graph  white is the one that had the coolest tempature  because the light went right through the color  so it didnt get really hot  as shown on the graph 
white  using a white color on the dog house will dec rese the amound of heat coming into the dog hous ther for it will keep the dog house more cooler then those darker colors this is becouse white absorbs no color but its self
black  if you choose black then inside the dog house will be very hot because in the experiment  the darker the color  the more hot it got inside the jar because dark colors absorb energy 
black  cuz will keep dog warm
white  it is to lite so it wouldent let of as much l ite 
black  black atracts heat
white  keep it cool
white  white is the best choice since the highest te mperaure was in the black jar at 54  deg   and the lowest was in the white jar at 43  deg  showing an 11  deg  difference  keeping the dog less hot in his house 
dark gray  because it can capture some sunlight
white  i think that the doghouse should be painted white because the lighter colors reflect more light energy than the dark  the average temperature of black lided jars was 53  deg   the average of the white jars was 42  deg   the dogs should live in a house that wont absorb too much energy so they wont overheat 
white  it wont be so hot
white  they should paint the doghouse white because in the data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would always be hot 
light gray  inside the doghouse in the summer it will keep it somewat cool and in the winter it will keep it somewat warm  also it was  in my opinion  the central temperature of them all being 45  deg  c 
white  if they made a white doghouse the air tempatu re would not be as hot is if they made the dog house black because lighter colors absorb less light 
dark gray  it would keep it warm in the wonter and cold in the summer so the dog wouldnt be to hot or to cold 
light gray  this color would keep the dog house cool in the summer and in the winter would still help heat the house the house would be warmer if thw color was black
black  the color might affect the inside tempature of the doghouse because the darkness provdes a type of covering that is like a insulation 
white  white would absorb less energy in the doghouse making it cooler inside the doghouse
light gray  it will make it so its nice and warm at night but still has enough heat retaned at night to keep himher warm
black  if the coloris darker it will absorb energy
black  if you were to chose black as your paint color  it woul warmer than the dark gray  light gray and white  in this experiment black got about 53  deg  c and the white got 42  deg  c 
light gray  well if u have a darker color like black for an exampl it could be way too hot in the midday  but if u have alight color like white for an example it would probably be way to cold at night so alight gray color would be the just right tempature
white  painting the doghouse white would allow the doghouse to stay cooler in the summer so that the dogs do not get too hot inside 
light gray  i chose light gray because dogs eyesight only contains black and white sight  they dont see color like humans do  so alight gray dog house will catch dogs attention 
light gray  this color will make the doghouse stay cooler when it is warm and sunny  but it will also create heat when it is cold 
light gray  this color can effect the doghouse by keeping it cool but to to cold and not to hot  becuase dark gray or black will over heat the dog  because of there fur 
dark gray  because it wasint the hotest or coldest tempi ture so it wouldent be to hot or cold in the dog house it had steady results
white  the white color would let the inside of the doghouse be cooler than the other types of paint because the white lids average temp  was 42  deg  c and the black lids average temp  was 53  deg  c  that is an 11  deg  differance for the dog to feel 
white  because if you have a dark color the light will make it hot for he dog 
white  the white paint color will reflect off heat and not absorb as much energy as the black paint which is a good paint color for the summer  the white paint color average for the temperature is 4 2  deg  c  while the black paint color average for the temperatue is 53  deg  c 
black  might affect the doghouse look nice for the dog
white  it wouldnt heat up so fast
black  i chose the color black for the doghouse because from the data collected  black was warmer than any other color with an average temperature of 53  deg  c compared to the lowest temperature of 42  deg  c for the color white  the dog in the house will stay warmer because black is the warmest color which i know by looking at the data brandi and jerry collected 
dark gray  i think that dark gray could be the color because it woulld not be to cold or to hot  so in the summer the dog house could stay cool  and in the winter it could stay warm 
light gray  i chose light gray because it will keep the inside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in an extremely hot place  the average temperature of the jar in the light gray jar was 45  deg  c  so it is enough to keep the dog warm  but not enough to make it uncomfortable 
white  white reflects energy instead of absorbing it like other colors  it also had the lowest air temperature inside in the jar of all three lids  this would make the doghouse cooler inside and more comfortable for the dogs inside 
white  white because after 10 minutes of heat it gets to about 42  deg  c and dogs should have cooling temperature  not hot 
dark gray  because it will keep the dog house warm
light gray  the dog house can eather be hot or cold so there isnt much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house 
light gray  the light gray color i think would be the best color to paint the dog house because the light gray color would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog warm but would also keep the dog cooler than black or dark gray and warmer than the white  from the experiment the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45  deg  c while the black lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c and the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48  deg  c  the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  the white color would keep the dog cool but the white color would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make the doghouse warm when needed 
light gray  the light grey soaks up heat but not too much 
white  this color might affect the dog house by not getting that much air inside  white has the lowest average tempeture which is 42  deg  c
white  i chose white because it would make it for a cooler house for the dog  acording to the data table shown  it says that the white lid will produce less heat than the other colors 
white  i belive white will work the best because it doesnt conduct as much heat as the orther ones did for exsampleb lack  drak grey  light gray  all got imbetween 44 and 54 well while the white paint only got 4241 and 42 as an aveage
black  if brandi and jerry pick the black roof then the inside of the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pick the dark grey  light grey or white roof  in the expirement  when brandi and jerry used the black lid  the temperature got up to 54  deg  c and with the dark grey lid  it only got up to 48  deg  c  with the light grey lid  the tempertature got up to 46  deg  c  and with the white lid  the temperature only got up to 43  deg  c  so most likely the black roof would make the inside of the dog house hot 
black  a black roof will keep the doghouse warm the average temperature of the black lid was 53  deg  c  but the average for the next highest color was 48  deg  c  therefore  a black roof will keep the dog at least 5  deg  c warmer than any other color 
dark gray  dark grey would keep it to a cool temperature  but not too cold  and not too warm  which is good for a dog 
white  i chose white becuase its the coolest and dogs have a lot of fur  so then they can escape the sun in a shady  cool dog house there was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees c and white whos highest was 43  in the winter they will have a big fur coat  so they wont need it warm inside their dog house  plus there isnt as much sun  if its too cold they can go inside the house 
black  because it increases the engery
white  this color might affect the doghouse by making it more ditry and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where 
white  so you can see the dog in its house
light gray  i think light gray would be the best paint color because its not going to make the dog house that hot but you also dont want it to be to cold so its a comfortable temperature light gray averaged about 45  deg  c while white averaged 42  deg  c  dark gray at 48  deg  c  and black at 53  deg  c 
light gray  it will keep the dog warm but not as hot as using black or dark grey paint  the average temp for black is 53  deg  and the average for the light grey paint is 45  deg  an 8  deg  difference 
white  they dog house would be cooler and not has hot as a black or darker color dog house would be making it better to be in on a hot day
black  black is the best color to choose because in the experiment  it said that the black lid attracted the most heat so they should use black paint to trap heat in the doghouse for the dog 
black  it would make the doghouses temperature rise 
white  white paint would effect the dog house because the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed  according to the data  the difference in temperature would be around 11 degreees centigrade then the black colour  so the white colour would absorb less heat resulting in a less hot doghouse 
dark gray  dark gray is the best choice because its not to hot and its not to cold  the average tempture is 48  deg  c and the other are 53  45 and 42
black  black would ceep the house warm wene the uv rays hit it they colect all the energy wich is in other words heat
white  white would work good cause that way the doghouse wont get to hot and it would be more comfortable 
white  the best color to paint a dog house would be white becuase white reflects heat from the sun which causes the dog house to become cooler in temperature  my support to my statement is in trial 1 the white white lid jar was the least in temperature becuase the white lidded jar was 42  deg  c and the light gray lidded jar was 44  deg  c and the dark gray lidded jar was 48  deg  c and the black lidded jar was 54  deg  c also in all the other trials the wjite lidded jar was cooler in temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars  so brandi and jerry should pick white to color there dog house if they want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog wouldnt get too hot and die 
white  the white color will be much cooler then the other colors because  in the experiment the darker colors made the inside of the jar hotter  but the white color hade the lowest temperture which would be the ideal color for a dog house 
dark gray  the best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray  this color may affect the inside of the doghouse because it would either keep it warmer or cooler  depending on the weather  the results from the experiment say that the dark gray lid made the jar 48  deg  c  in ten minutes  so it would keep the doghouse warm  it really just depends on the climate of where the dog live 
light gray  i picked light gray because i think the black and dark gray doghouse would absorb too much energy and make it too hot for a dog to be in  whereas the light gray doghouse wont be too hot or too cold 
white  white would be the best color because when it is summer and it gets hot the inside will be cool because black absorbs sun while white reflexs sun
dark gray  if there is dirt in the dog house it would be hard to see it
white  by choosing a white color for the dog house it will keep the dog cooler  i know this because in the experiment the average temperature in the jar with a black lid was 53  but the average temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42  therefore the darker the paint color the warmer the dog house 
white  the best color for the doghouse would be white  because it absorbs less energy than a black color  and the black lid average was 53  deg  c and the white lid was 42  deg  c 
white  the color white will effect the dog house because the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would  so the white doghouse will be cooler in temerature 
white  it would be much cooler than if it was black
white  white color doesnt absorb as much light as black  black color get hotter by direct sunlight because it is abosorbing it while white color simply reflects the light so it stays at about the same temperature 
light gray  the light gray color might prevent it from being either too cold or to hot  also in the results  the color gray was the second to least heated of them all 
white  it will make the dog house cooler than if you used black paint because white paint doesnt absorb that much energy
white  the dog house will be cooler if painted white and more comfortable for a dog  in the experiment the temperatures for the jars  in  deg  c  with the black lid were 53  dark gey 48  light grey 45  and white 42  the white was 11  deg  c less than the hottest jar  black 
white  white because it doesnt absorb as much heat as black
light gray  the color of the paint on the doghouse will affect it in many ways  to begin with  it will change the temperature of the doghouse  if the doghouse were black  then it would absorb alot of the energy radiating from the sun  because darker colors hold heat more  the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse  making the temperature cooler then if it were painted darker  the dark grey is going to keep it warm  but not as hot as the black paint would  and the light grey would keep it cooler  but not as cool as the white would  so it would all depend on were you lived  and what temperature best suited your pet  the darker colors are going to absorb more of the heat  and the lighter col ors are going to reflect more of it off  i would choose light grey for my doghouse though  because it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white 
dark gray  if i were to paint a dog house the color i would choose would be dark grey because black would absorb to much heat during the hot days and white would absorb no heat so during cold night the dog house would be very cold and dark grey is just in the middle so it does not get to hot or to cold 
dark gray  dark gray is the best color to paint a doghouse with for many reasons  one reason is that in the results of their experiment drak gray had the same temperature all 3 trial times and same aver age of 48  deg  c this ment that dark gray is a good color for a doghouse because it will absorb the right amount of energy in order for the doghouse to maintain at the right temperature  dark grayis not a too dark color but not a too light color either 
black  the color black will make the doghouse warmer  this is becuase in the experiment the average temperature for the black lid was 53  deg  c compared to the white lid at the average of 42  deg  c  this shows that the darker the color the warmer the objectdoghouse will be because it obsorbs more heat 
light gray  i chose light gray because it is the perfect temperature  its average temperature  45  deg  c  is a very good tempera ture not too hot and not too cold  if you paint the doghouse taht clour  it will be warm  but only slightly  it would protect the dog from swelte ring heat but keep it from freezing 
light gray  if the doghouse were to be light gray  the air temperature wouldnt be too low  but not too high  the average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is 8  deg  while the difference between light gray and white is 3  deg   this way  light gray would be perfect as an inbetween 
white  the dog well be more comfitable in the dog house 
light gray  i chose light gray because it doesnt attract a whole lot of heat like if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white does  inside the doghouse in the winter would be nice because it would attract some heat to be warm in the winter  in the summer it would be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as if the color of the doghouse was black  another reason why i chose light was it had an average temp of 45  deg  c warmer than whites average temp of 42  deg  c 
white  i think that white would be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temputure so it would be the coldest for the dog 
white  white is the best color to choose because it reflects the suns rays better than any other color  and it wont make the inside get to hot
white  white will not attract the light as much as any of the othe colors  therefore allowing the dog to stay cool 
light gray  coloring the doghouse light gray could keep the temperature inside the doghouse at a cool average of 45  deg  c  which is the average temperature inside the glass jar for the lid color vs  air temperature inside glass jar experiment 
white  the best color would be white because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler because the color white atracts less heat energy then the other colors because the results show that white had lower temperatures than the other colors
dark gray  brandi and jerry should use dark gray because it would be a comfertable temperature for the dog at 48  deg  c  wich the data says is its average
light gray  it wold keep it warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer  the medium shade color is a fantastic way to keep a pet warm
white  because it will stay the coolest and the dog wont like it in there if its cold
white  so the dog house doesent heat up as fast in the summer so the dog can stay in his house longer
light gray  the color would affect the doghouse because darker colors absorb more light energy  so light grey would absorb some but not alot keeping the inside of the doghouse cool and not really hot  45  deg  
light gray  it will be the right temp for a dog
dark gray  i would choose dark gray because it will not absorb as much light as black would  but it still is a dark color to absorb some light  this would affect the inside temperature of the doghouse because it wont be to cold nor to hot in the doghouse  comparing my choice to the expirement when they used black as the lid color it gave the hot est inside air temperature  dark gray was in 2cnd place with a temperature of 48  deg  c  but i thought 45  deg  c for the light gray would be to cold 
white  painting the doghouse white would affect it because in the summer  the doghouse would be cooler  in the experiment  the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42  deg  c while the pthers were much higher 
white  i chose to paint the doghouse the color white based off of brandi and jerrys experiment results  in the experiment  when they tested the lid color black  the average temperature inside the jar was 53  deg  c  this was the highest temperature out of the colors and the temperature raised by 29  deg   meanwhile  the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  therefore having the lowest temperature aver age  this time  the temperature raised only 18  deg  after ten minutes  compared to the black lid  the white lid raised to a temperature and had a change from the original temperature of 11  deg  less  ultimately  i chose to paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the coolest  white had the lowest average temperature of 42  deg  c and would keep any dog nice and cool 
dark gray  i say dark gray because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that if its cold outside  and it doesnt get it too hot for a sunny day outside  its a 5050 type thing warm enough and not too cold 
white  black average temperature was 53  deg  dark gray average temperature was 48  deg  light gray average temperature was 45  deg  white average temperature was 42  deg  because of the cool temperatures  i would choose white as the doghouse color  with black  the doghouse would be pretty hot and uncomfortable for the dog 
white  white would be the best color to have for dog house because its temperature would keep the dog house the coolest  in the experiment the white colored jar had an average of 42  deg  c  so that was the best choice and the worst choice was black  the black colored jar had an average of 53  deg  c  so that was the worst choice because it could be to hot for the dog 
white  it will keep it from being to hot in the summer
light gray  it may affect the dog house because if its too hot then the dog will get too hot and if its too cold the dog would freeze so if its not too hot and not too cold the dog house will be good for the dog year around 
dark gray  this color will make the doghouse one temperature and not many different temperatures  in the experiment the dark gray lid stayed at 48  deg  c 
black  if you would paint a doghouse you would want your dog to be warm  so painting the doghouse black would keep him or her warm 
white  the color might affect the doghouse because the darker the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler it is inside  for example when tested the blakc got 53  deg  c  the dark gray got 48  deg  c  the light gray got 45  deg  c  and the white got 42  deg  c  you see as the color increases from darkto light  the temp ature decreases 
white  i would choose the color white for the color of the doghouse because  it will make the inside of the dog house cooler for the dog so that during hot summer days the dog can stay cool and not super hot  the reason why this would work is shown on the trial board  while there was a black lid on ajar the average temperature of inside of jar after 10 minutes was 53  deg  c when there was a white lid on the jar the average temperature of the jar was 42  deg  c  that is a 11  deg  difference between the two lids  so if you want the doghouse to be colder for the dog youd want to get a white doghouse 
black  black  because if black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most heating average for ther dog house 
white  it cant be black because black obsorbs light  which would increase the temp  and white reflects light so that is why white kept the doghouse cooler at an average 
black  if they were to use a black paint it would de finetely increase the dog houses air tempature  accordinq to the data the color black had an average of 52  deg  c  after ten minutes of the experiment  unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average tempatures 
white  the data table shows that the white lid jar took in the least heat  the black lid jar took in an average of 53  deg  c after 10 minutes under the lamp  the white lid jar only took in an average of 42  deg  c  this is why the doghouse should be painted white to keep most of the heat out 
dark gray  if the doghouse were dark gray  it might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse  heat is attracted to darker objects  so it would be warmer  but not as warm as it would be black  the data from the experiment shows that the black lid on average was 53  deg  c  the dark gray lid was 48  deg  c  the light gray was 45  deg  c  and the white was 42  deg  c 
black  the color black could affect the temperature in the dog house because the color black can attract light and heat since the color black is an absence of light 
white  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white because then the inside of the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog to be inside it when its sunny outside  i know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid  the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 53  deg  c after 10 minutes  but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a white lid  the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 42  deg  c after 10 minutes  so  if the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler 
light gray  it will affect the doghouse by it being cooler then heat temperature getting attracted to it 
white  white would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer because it reflects more light waves than it absorbs  in their test brandi and jerry found that white kept the jar the coolest
white  the white color paint will protect the doghouse from heat because it isnt as dark  from the experiment it shows that a darker object stores more energy causing it to heat up in air temperature 
white  because the darker the lid color  the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar  because darker colors absorb more energy 
dark gray  it will keep the dog house inside warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather 
white  having white would make the inside temp  cooler because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42  deg  c 
light gray  light gray because when it is warm  the dog will want to stay cool and when the weather is cold the dog will want to stay warm  the results got higher and lower  for example  the first trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial 
black  black is a darker coler  if you were to were a white shirt apposed to a black one on a hot day you will be warmer in the black shirt because it absorbs more energy 
white  the color white because it wont attract as much energy or haet if it were darcker
light gray  this color might affect the dog house by making it kind of cool and not so hot for the dog because it is not as dark as black so it wont absorb a lot of energy but also it is not as light as white so it wont be too cold
white  it would affect the doghoused because white is cooler than the dark colors  the average for white was 42 while the average for black was 53 
white  if the doghouse is somewhere warm  it should be white to keep it as cool as possible inside the doghouse 
black  the black paint would insulate the inside of the dog house and keep it warm  the color black reflects heat  in the experiment black had the highest average temperture of 53  deg  over all the other tested colors 
light gray  t way this color might affect the inside of the doghouse by not being to hot because the darker the lid color  the greater the increase in the air temperature amd because light gray is only 45  deg  c 
white  i would use white because it is the coolest color and it wont over heat the dog as bad unlike the other colors 
black  if brandi and jerry chose black  it would keep the dog house the warmest out of the four colors
white  it would keep the dog dog house the coolest on the inside  so it wouldnt get too hot  where if you painted it black it would get much warmer in there 
white  i would use white to paint my dog house because it would make it colder inside for the dog  in the experiment the white lens tested to stay the coldest inside the jar so the white paint on the dog house would make it so the dog house was colder for the dog 
dark gray  they might want to choose dark gray because it will make the doghouse not too hot as black and not too cold as white for it will still obsorb heat and make the doghouse warm like the jar temperatures stayed the same at 48  deg  c after heated  so the dog would stay more and obtain the same amount of temperature the whole time when heated most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures 
white  it will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler in it  it showed it was 42  deg  and thats cooler than all the other colors
white  the dog needs warmth
black  it will effect the dog house is by the color of the paint and the temperoture  also it will effect it is because how dark is the paint 
black  if it were to be cold outside  the black on the doghouse should make it warmer 
black  the black would absorbe the most thermal energy causing the dog house to have a higher air tempature  get warmer  
white  white will make it so that the dog house will be cooler for the dog
white  the white color attracks less heat so that way the dog isnt to hot or to cold
black  the color black will affect the inside of the doghouse because the darker the color  the greater the increase in air temperature  in the results of the hot lamp experiment  the blacks air temperature got the highest average with 53  deg  c this is because dark co lors absorb more energy 
light gray  light gray so the doghouse wont be so hot 
black  well in cold temperatures like in the experiment you would want your dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because that color absorbs the most heat keeping the doghouse warm  if it was the summer time you might want to used white or light gray to keep the house cool 
dark gray  i would use dark grey because  based of were i live  its colder most of the year but its hot during summer so that way when the dog is inside during winter its warm and during summer its not too hot
white  white will keep the dog house cooler inside because its the lightest  brightest  color up there and in the experiment it shows that the over all average of the black  darkest color  was 53 degrees c and the average color for the white lid was 42 degrees c  therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house 
black  by painting the doghouse black  brandi and jerry will be allowing more heat to be attracted to the doghouse  the data table from the experiment proves this point because it shows that the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid was 53  deg  c  which is the highest average temperature of the four lid colors that were used in the experiment 
black  black might effect the dog house by keeping it warmer because black attacts heat  it asorbs the heat 
light gray  this way the inside of the doghouse wont be too hot or too cold  the average temperature was 45  deg   white would be too cold because the average temperature was 42  deg   black would be too hot because the average temperature was 53  deg  
white  it will make it not as warm
white  beacuse white reflects the sun so it would stay cooler
white  i chose white because its a very bright  cheerful and an elegant color and the dog wont get really hot like he would in black or dark gray 
white  i think that the best paint color for the dog house is white  i picked this color because white doesnt affect the inside of the house with a lot of heat  so it would stay cool during the summer time for a dog  because if you paint it balck  sense black attracts the sun it would attract more energy and have more of the hott sun going in the dog house 
light gray  i chose light gray because if you put black it might be too hot because the trials where the avergae was 53  deg  c  for dark gray it may also get to hot hot because the average was 48  deg  c  light gray was 45  deg  c and that just perfect it wont be to cold or to hot  white may be to cold at 42  deg  c 
white  whites  color of paint  affect on the doghouse will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up  so in the summer  the dog will be able to stay cooler  longer  i know this because in the experiment  the white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by atleast 2  deg  c each trial 
black  i chose black becuase that means the dog house would be warmer on the inside  i know that because the average temperature of black after ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperature of white after ten minutes is 42 degrees 
white  having a white doghouse would keep the inside mof the doghouse cooler  the average tempature for the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42  deg   while the inside of the jar with the black lid was an average of 53  deg   the dog house would be on average 11  deg  cooler 
light gray  since the darker colors were to hot and the lighter colors were to cold the light gray was kind of the middle so the dog wont be to cold or to hot
white  you would choose white because instead of absorbing the sun light like black paint the white paint reflects it which would make the dog house more cool 
white  the color that would be best for the doghouse in the summer would be white  in the experiment with the effects of color on temperature  the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperature  rising from 24  deg  c to an average of 53  deg  c  but the white lid caused the least increase in temperature  rising from 24  deg  c to only 42  deg  c  so if brandi and jerry want to keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer  they should choose to paint the outside of the dog house white  as it provides the least increase in temperature 
white  a white dog house would make it cooler inside  from the data the average temperature for white was 42  deg  c which was cooler then the other colors 
white  it will effect the dog house by absorbing less heat energy keeping the dog house cool  evidence frome the table states the average temp  for white is 42 celsius 
white  i think they should paint the dog house white because when there is a dark color such as black it will absorbe the he at so its best to use white so it wont be as hot in the dog house 
white  the color white will reflect more of the sunlight  wich will make the house a colder temperature white was the coldest temperature in the expirement its average was 42  deg  wich was the lowest temperature and black had the highest temperature wich was 53  deg  as an average 
white  well   if they were trying to make the doghouse nice and cool  they should use white the color white reflects everything off of it making it a perfect doghouse to stay cool in it blocks about 30 more heat than a black dog house 
white  the white light will make the dog house have light in it 
black  i think black becuase it was the highest number on the average it was 53 
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light gray  light gray will keep the doghouse not too warm but not too cold  in the experiment the light gray lid let in an average of 45  deg  c  the black lid let in an average of 53  deg  c  the least heat let in was the white lid with an average of 42  deg  c  if i chose the white lid  the dog might be too cold inside his house  with black paint  the dog could be too hot inside his house 
light gray  the best color for a doghouse might be light gray because it wouldnt be to cold and it wouldnt be to hot  in the data it shows that the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45  deg  c and the others were 53  48  and 42  deg  c
light gray  i like that color so i chose that color 
dark gray  dark grey because black is probably to hot and white is probably to cold  but dark grey is right in the middle  it will keep the dog warm 
light gray  this color was the in between color  or middle color  it was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good balance  so for trial 1 it was 44  deg  c for trial 2 it was 45  deg  c  for 3 it was 46  deg  c and for trial 4 it was back to 45  deg  c  this is the best color  since it will keep the dog warm  but not too warm and not to cold either 
dark gray  i think the bes color would be dark gray because its not the darkest and the darkest color absorbes more heat  its not the lightest so it wont be very cold 
white  this color might affect the inside of the dog house because in jerry and brandis experiment  white was proved to be the coolest  in degrees  color  versus black because the black lid attracted more light 
white  reduced tempertures
light gray  i chose the color light grey because with sun the temperature inside the dog house will be around 45  deg  and that is not to hot and not to cold for the dog 
white  white is the best color for the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy than light colors  with white paint inside the dog house its going to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house its going to be hot  in the experiment dark color lids attraked more heat and the air was hotter than with the light color lids thats why white color paint will be abetter color for the dog house so it stays cooler 
white  it willbe cooler then the other colors for the dog house
light gray  light gray might keep the dog house warm in the winter yet cool in the summer because in the expiriment light gray att rects heat  but not alot of heat 
white  well since the color is light gray instead of dark gray or black  it wont absorb as much heat  making a cool place to stay on a hot summer day  if it was light gray it wouldent be so bad etheir but white sounded like the best option  thses facts are true because the experiment shows that a black lid did absorb more heat  while the others not so much 
dark gray  a dark gray might make the inside of the dog house hot  because darker colors absorb more heat energy  that would keep the dog house warmer at night  so thats why i picked dark gray  i also pick it because it will not absorb to much energy 
white  white doghouse would be nice and cool in it
white  because the color white reflects thelight and heat better  in order to keep the doghouse cool it should be painted white  this will make the doghouse cooler inside  especially during the summer 
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light grey  because then  the lightness of the doghouse would keep the temperature down  and then tint of darkness would keep it mildly warm 
white  it would reflect the heat and keep the inside cool
white  the white color will make the doghouse cooler in the summer by reflecting the light
dark gray  i think that brandi and jerry should use the dark gray paint because that way the inside of the dog house is cool for the dog when its hot outside unlike the three other paint colors that will attract the sun and make it hot inside the dog house  and also the dog wont have troubles sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house to bother the dog while trying to sleep 
white  white is the lightest color there fore it will attract the least amount of heat 
white  white has more energy its cooler and black and all the other colors are darker then white  the darker colors are closer together so they do not let as much light in
light gray  the color light gray would be good for the dog house  because when it is hot the doghouse wont be that hot inside  other than blak nd drack gray 
white  if it is white then the dog house will stay cooler and the dog wont over heat 
light gray  because they probably dont want it to be to hot or to cold so if they use dark gray then it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog  the temp would have an average temp of 45  deg  not to hot not to cold 
dark gray  if brandi and jerry choose dark gray for their dog house then the dog house would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house but wont be cold like a white dog house  therefore the dog would be comfortable being in a cool  but at the same time warm doghouse 
white  dog houses are to protect and shade the dog and white does not attract heat
white  a white painted doghouse would make the internal temperture cooler because as the experiment has shown  the average internal air temperture of the jar with a white lid was 42  deg   while the other lids caused average tempertures ranging from 45  deg   53  deg  
black  painting a doghouse black would help heat the house  from the experiment  black made the air temperature rise the most 
white  the color white might affect the doghouse bec uase during summer months it will not absorb as much ehat energy as a black doghouse would  although in the winter months you will want more of that energy abosrb so it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the winter months 
white  because white doesnt absorb heat because its not an dark color 
light gray  light grey paint would keep the doghouse a mutual temprature  with alight grey colored paint on the doghouse the house wouldnt be to hot on a sunny day like a darker color would make it  an don a cold day the dog house wouldnt be to cold with alight grey paint 
white  this color will make the doghouse cooler so the dog will be more comfortable in the hot sun  according to the experiment the whitecolored lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the 4 lids  it was 42  deg  in the white lid for trial one and 54  deg  for the black lid on trial one 
black  choosing the color black will affect the doghouse because dark colors absorb more energy
dark gray  i would paint the dog house dark gray  this way the dog house is warm in the winter but not to hot in the summer 
dark gray  the color dark gray would affect the tempature of the doghouse because  as the data shows  a darker color results in hotter tempatures  the data shows that the average temature was 53  deg  c for black  which would be to hot for a dog house  the dark gray however  had a lower tempature of 48  deg  c  which would be the correct tempature to keep a dog warm  but not hot 
dark gray  if its a hot day the dog house wont get too hot and if its a cold day the dog house wont get too cold  the average tempature for the jar with the dark gray lid under the lamp is 45  deg  c
white  this color wouldnt make it as hot inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster  the black heated up to 53  deg  and the white only heated up to 42  deg 
light gray  the color light gray might affect the doghouse by balancing out the temperature of the air outside or around the doghouse  this also might be the most comforatable temp for the dog  since  in brandi amp jerris investigation  after being placed under a lamp for 1 0 minutes  the air temperature inside of the light gray lid jar was 45 degrees celcius  while the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees ce lsius were white42  dark gray48  amp black53 so  alight gray doghouse would be 8 degrees celsius cooler then a black doghouse  in which i would assume to be a more comforatable temperature 
light gray  i think that light grey would be a good color for a doghouse because this color would make the doghouse not too hot and not too cold  according to the lid experiment light grey had averaging tempertures of 4446 compared to the black average of 5254 and the white average of 4143  the averages for the light grey lid are moderately cool which would be a good choice for a dog so they dont overheat or freeze 
white  white would be the less warm when the sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other choice
black  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black because the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most  accordding to the data if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer then if you paint it white because black got an average of 53  deg  and white got an average of 42  deg   so the re for black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside 
white  the lighter the color  the less heat that color will attractabsorb
white  white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler  the average temperature for white was 42  deg  c after 10 minutes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color  grey  at 45  deg  c
white  because the others takes in the light more than the white paint
white  white would have a lower temperature inside the doghouse  making it nice and cool for the dog 
white  if you chose to paint the doghouse white than it would be cool inside for your dog to rest incool off on hot summer days  white would decrease the temperature of the dog house because in the air temperature experiment  the color black  the darkest lid  had the highest avg  temperature inside of the glass jar which was 53 c  the lightest color of lid  white  had the lowest avg  temperature inside of the glass jar and it was 42 c  the difference between the dark lid  black  and the light lid  white  was 11 c  so therefore the lighter the color in this case white  will attract the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature 
white  if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse white  then the light would reflect off he dog house  if they ppainted it black then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and  if temperature gets hot enough  possibly even burn or catch on fire 
light gray  the white may be best because it is the colle st color  tempurature  as shown in the chart and will make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house 
light gray  light gray willl be the best color because it wil absorb some heat but also keep the dog from getting to hot in the summer the temperture where around 45  deg  c which is good for a dog
white  that color will absorb the least amount of light keeping the dog house cooler
white  white will keep your dog house cooler on the inside rather than using a dark color like black because that will attract more heat 
dark gray  the color dark grey would be the best color to paint the dog house  the color dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as the black  i know this because the average of the black in the experiment is 53  deg  c and the average temperature for dark grey is 48  deg  c
black  black might effect the dog house because in the chart black has the highest temperature of all colors
white  using white paint for the doghouse will keep it cooler  in the experiment  the jar with the black lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c and the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42  deg  c  the jar with the white lid was an average of 11  deg  c cooler than the jar with the black lid 
light gray  light grey would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer  but will also will absorb more light than white  so it will be warmer in the winter 
white  white would be a good color to paint the dog house because in the trials white had the cooler temperature 
dark gray  i would choose light gray because it would keep the dog nice and cool during day and warm at night  also depends on where they live 
black  black would make the inside of the doghouse warm because the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the sunlight  so if brandi and jerry used the color black for the lid of the glass jar then the lid would absorb more of the heat from the bulb  if brandi and jerry used the color white for the lid then the lid wouldnt absorb much of the heat from the bulb 
black  it will keep the house warmer in the winter  the balck lid had a average temperature of 53  deg  c and the dark gray had the average of 48  deg  c  the light gray had an average of 45  deg  and the white had an average of 42  deg  c  therefor  the black colored roof is the best 
black  black being the color of the doghouse might affect it by making it warmer  higher temperature  because it absorbs more light energy  in the results  the temperature was 53  deg  c while with the white lid was only 42  deg  c  showing that black resulted in the highest temperature  was the warmest  
light gray  it would make it so its not too hot  but not too cold either 
dark gray  the best paint for it will be the dark gray because darker colors absorb more energy 
white  white would change the temperature inside the doghouse because the lighter the color or the darker the color the cooler or hotter the air will be inside the doghouse  so if the doghouse was white the air temperature will be cooler than the black air temperature doghouse  i know that dogs like cooler air better than hotter air
light gray  if it is black then it will get hotter insine unlike gray it wont
white  if brandi and jerry were to paint the dog house white  it would keep it cooler  when they did the lid experment  the average for the darker lid was highest  53  deg  c   if they were to paint the dog house a darker color it would become hotter quicker  the average for the white paint was 42  deg  c so it proves that painting the dog sea lighter color will keep it cooler 
dark gray  i think dark gray is the best coler because in the winter it will not be so cold because it will get some of the sun and heat up  and also in the summer it would not be so hot from the sun  so the dog could always be in hisher dog house any time of year 
black  the black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors of paint  the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid was 53  deg  c  the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42  deg  c  the jar with the black paint was 11  deg  c warmer than the jar with the white lid 
black  if they were to choose black for their paint color  they would find that the dog house would attract more heat because thats what darker colors do attract heat 
white  they should use the color white because the color white doesnt attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it cooler inside of the dog house  the results show that in all the trials white was in the low 40s  and all the other colors like light grey and black were in the high 40s and low 50s  therefore the dog house would be cooler with white paint 
black  using black with attract more sun and it would be hotter inside the doghouse and hot to touch so unless you like it warm i would light gray 
white  i think white because the inside will be cool eras shown in the experiment  the white lids highest temperature in the experiment was 43  deg  where as the blacks highest temperature was 54  deg   which proves the white is cooler 
white  i choose white  this mite affect the dog house by making cooler in hot weather  i choose this because in the experiment white had the coolest temperature
white  if brandi and jerry pianted the dog house white  then in the sun light the dog house will stay to an average of about 4045  deg  c because the color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house 
white  it will stay cool and if it was black it would be to hot for the dog 
black  the darker the color the warmer the dog house is going to be beacuse dark colors obsorbe more light then other colors
white  this color would be good for a dog because if the dog needs to cool off the white color attracks less heat  i know this because the average temperature for black was 53  deg   for dark gray it was 48  deg   for light gray it was 45  deg  and for white it was 42  deg  therefore white attracks less heat
dark gray  i would chose dark gray because in the summer it would be nice and cool and in the winter it wouldnt freez  the avrege temp  is 48  deg   though out all the trials 
white  because not absorb much energy this color 
white  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white because the affect on the doghouse is that the color white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse black  this is because black absorbs more energy  causing the inside of the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects  energy  light so itll keep the inside of the doghouse cooler  from the experiment  when a black lid was used  the tempature inside the glass jar was 48  deg  c but when a white lid was used  the tempature inside the glass jar was 42  deg  c  so as you can see the lighter the color of the lid  the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar will be and the darker the color of the lid  the warmer the tempature inside the glass jar will be 
light gray  because it had 5 more then dark gray
light gray  i chose light gray  because the inside of the doghouse will not be too hot or too cold if light gray was chosen  i learned in brandi and jerrys expirament that the darker the color of the lid was  the warmer the air temperature inside the jar was  after 10 minutes   if the dog house was light gray  the dog will be comfortably warm 
white  it wil keep the sun from hitting him
white  thay should choose white becuse it attracts less heat so the dog can stay cooler
black  it will absorb heat because blackabsorbs heat
white  they should choose white because according to the data the white had the lowest temperature average of 42  deg  c and it was the lighest color  if they chose black the dog house would be too hot  i know this because black has the highest temerature average  53  deg  c  
white  because hot and the black made the jar 53 25  deg   on average  while the white only made it 42  deg  on average  making white the better choice 
white  it would absorbe less heat so the dog would be cooler than with black paint 
black  the averagre air temp in the jar was 53  deg 
white  the color white is the best paint color for the doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool  white averaged at 42  deg  c after 10minutes while black was 53  deg  c  proving that the white color paint will keep the doghouse cooler 
black  black would be the best color if brandi and jerry lived in a cold area because black obsorbs heat more than any other color  according to thier experiment the black lid had the highest temperature 
black  black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warm  black was 11  deg   8  deg   and 5  deg  more than the white  light gray  and dark gray paints 
black  the color black attrackeds more thermal energy than the other colors 
light gray  i chose light gray because the doghouse would be a little warm and a little fresh therefore the dog wouldnt be as hot on a sunny day or as cold on a rainy day
white  this color will affect the dog house because it will keep it cool when its hot outside instead of being really hot in side of the dogs house because it stays the coolest 
light gray  so it wont be too cool or too hot
light gray  if you are gonna paint a doghouse paint it light gray because the results of the experement show that the darker the color the higher the tempature and you dont want it to hot but you want it a little warm so you would paint it light gray 
white  white will keep the doghouse cooler and your dog get overheated and sick 
light gray  the dog house would be cold but for the dog which would have fur it would be warm and refreshingly cold so it would not freeze and it would not over heat 
white  black will make the doghouse warmer because black attracts the light 
black  it would make the doghouse much warmer as seen in the jar experiment 
white  it whould be cooler inside the doghouse
dark gray  the dark grey paint would keep the doghouse warm when its cold out  but not as hot as the black paint when its warm out  the dark grey paint got the inside of a glass jar to 48  deg  in direct light in just ten minutes  so it should keep the doghouse at a reasonable temperature 
white  white reflects the suns rays
white  since dogs have fur  they dont need to be any warmer so they should paint the dog house a lighter color  the black color was 53  deg  c and the white was 42  deg  c making the white coloe less likely to become hot
black  in the data table it shows the black paint will keep the doghouse the warmest because  black obsorbs more sunlight than dark gray  light gray or white paint
black  the color black will effect the dog house more because of the more energy it observes the tempeture goes higher
white  the doghouse would be build to cool off the dog so if you paint the doghouse white then the doghouse would absorb less heat therefore keeping the dog cooled off 
white  white would be a good color for the dog house because a dog can get very hot during the summer so the inside of the doghouse will stay cool  in the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage temperature of 42  deg  c when the black lid had an average temperature of 53  deg  c  also out of the 4 colores the air in the glass jar with the white lid was the coolest
black  black would obsorb the heat and keep the dog house warm in the experiment in trial one the temperature was 54  deg  c compared to the color white wich was 42  deg  c the temperature was a big jump from black and white 
white  it will keep the dog cooler because it was the least warmest in the jar 
white  if they paint the dog house white  it would stay cooler compaired to the black
white  having white paint would make the dog house colder so in the summer the dog would not be hot  the average for white is the coolest tempature  42  deg  
light gray  i think that light gray is a good color because when its sunny and hot outside  the darker colors will make the doghouse very warm and most likely uncomfortable for the dog  i didnt choose white because although its not a huge difference  light gray was still a little bit warmer than white without being too hot 
light gray  the inside wont be hot and it wont be very cold either  the light gray average temperature had an average of 45  deg  c unlike the black lid which got hotter and had an average temperature of 53  deg  c 
light gray  i think that the best color to paint the dog house would be light gray because if you paint it black or dark gray then in the summer it will get too hot inside the dog house  but if you paint it white then it will get too cold in the dog house in the winter so think that light gray is the perfect color to paint the dog house 
black  based on the results in the experiment if they painted the doghouse black it would keep the air temeture inside the doghouse the highest wich would keep the dog the warmest 
white  if the doghouse is white the doghouse will be cooler on the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside 
dark gray  the black color might affect the doghouse in a good way  because it will keep the doghouse warm when it is sunny outside  and the dog wont be cold it will be warm 
white  brandi and jerry should paint the the doghouse the color white  this color will affect the inside of the doghouse because it will absorb less heat and make the inside of the doghouse cooler than if you use a dark color becaue light colors absorb less energy  evidence from brandi and jerrys hot lamp experiment showed that the darker the color of the lid  the warmer the air inside the jar was  so if they plan to have a living animal inside  in this case a dog  i think itd be more comfortable if the doghouse wasnt hot  they should paint the dog house white 
white  white is the best choose for the dog house be cause it will stay cooler the the other color
black  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse black because in the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54  deg   trial two 52  deg   trial three 54  deg   and the adv erage they got was 53  deg   so they should paint the doghouse black because it will stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black 
white  i think it wont affect the doghouse because it is white and i dont think it well attract the sun as much as the black color well 
white  if you design a white doghouse the chances are that the doghouse would be more cooler then the black  dark gray  light gray doghouses because the darker the color the more energy it will absorb  see beacause when they did the experiment the black lid absorbed more energy then all the others because of its drak color  and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because its lighter color 
black  if brandi and jerry painted their dog house black it would absorb more energy from the sun and be warmer inside  i know this because in their experiment the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature  the average temperature of the jar with the black lid was 53  deg  c which is higher than the dark gray  48  deg  c   the light gray  45  deg  c   and the white  42  deg  c 
black  the black paint would affect the doghouse  be cause it would absorb heat and insulate the doghouse  making it hot 
light gray  brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light gray because in the summer time it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then the black and dark grey but a little warmer then the white 
black  useing the black color for the dog house will make the dog house warmer because on the data of the lid color vs  air tempature inside glass jar  the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 42  deg  s so therefore the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint 
black  black because in the experiment it shows that black keeps heat in more
white  the best paint color for the doghouse would be white  in the experiment white had an average of 42  deg  c wich wus the lowest temperature out of the four colors  white would keep the doghouse cool 
light gray  light grey so it disnt get too hot in the sumer and not too cold in the winter 
black  black would probubly affect the doghouse because it would absorb more heat  plus the experiment shows that black kept in the most heat 
white  white is the best color because in the expera ment the white colored lid was the least one to atrack heat and was the lowest in tempeture 
white  if they paint the doghouse white then the tem peratrure inside will be alot cooloer becuase the white lid was 11  deg  cooler than the jar with the black lid  therefore painting the doho use white would keep the dog nice and cool
black  it would affect the doghouse by always keeping it warm  because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the light more  and in the investigation the average for black was 53  the highest out of the rest  so thats my prove that it would make it warmerhot 
white  if you use white the tem in the dog house would be less
white  the inside of the dog house wont be so hot be cause white paint wouldnt absorb alot of heat energy
dark gray  the inside of the dog house would be moderatl y warm with dark gray at 48  deg  c  black would make it hot at 50  deg  c  light gray would make it cool at 45  deg  c  and white would keep it cold at 42  deg  c 
dark gray  i believe that the doghouse should be dark gray because not only the temperature from the experiment  but also the suitable conditions for a dog  according to the data the average temperature is at 48  deg  c while the color black is at 53  deg  c  for a dog to live in a doghouse the temperature shouldnt be too hot or too cold 
dark gray  if the color is dark grey for the doghouse than it would keep the dog warmer during harsh weather yet not too warm for very warm seasons  in the investigation hot lamp  the lid color that increased the inside temperature the most was the black colored lid with an average temperature of 53  deg  c  however the second highest was the dark grey lid with an average of 48  deg  c  so  the dark grey roof would be the perfect color for the house  to keep the dog at a comfortable temper ture 
black  because  the darker the lid color  the greater the increase in the air temperature in the glass jar 
dark gray  the best paint color would be dark gray because it keeps heat inside the dog house because of the color and when its warm out it wont be too hot to stay in for the dog 
black  i believe that the best color for the doghouse is black  this color may affect the inside of the doghouse by increasing its temprature  therefore  the dog can stay warm  i know this is true because the average heat in the experiment for black was 53 degrees  while the average temprature with white  for example  was 42 degrees  clearly  black would be the best color for the doghouse 
white  white would be a good color for the doghouse because the white will not absorb heat and the dog will have cool place to go during the summer or hot days 
light gray  light gray because it is not that hot or that cold and it has a okay average 
white  white is the best choice because when they did the test with the lamp  the white lid was the coolest with an average temperature of 42  deg  c  the black lid was 53  deg  c  the dark gray lid was 48  deg  c  and the light gray lid was 45  deg  c  if they use black as the doghouse colour then the dog might get to hot if heshe stays in there to long  if they use dark gray for the dog house then he will have more time to get out of the dog house before heating up but he still can heat up  if they use light gray for the colour of the dog house then the dog will still have more time to get out of the dog house than if the used black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating  if they use white as the dog house colour then the dog will have the most amount of time to get out before heshe over heats 
dark gray  if they chose dark grey  the average temperature would be 48  deg  which is normal so the dog house wouldnt be so hot for the dog  but cozy and not as cold either 
light gray  i would go with the light gray because gray keeps heat in but not to much heat and gray lets the cold air out when its cold out side
light gray  u waant one that will keep u worm in the winter but cool in the summer
white  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house white because than the dog can stay cooler in the summer time
white  if they use white paint for the doghouse  the house wont be too hot for the dog  because during the experiment they found out that the darker the color  the more energy it absorbes 
white  the color is going to effect the dog house by makeing the house fresh because dark colors consume more tempeture 
black  the color might affect the dog house because the darker the color is the warmer the dog house would be  in the experiment hot lamp  the darker the lid was the warmer the air got inside the jar  when the lid was black the tempature was at 53  deg   c  and when the white lid was on the tempature decreased to 42  deg   c  
white  white because the white gets less heat than the other colors  black got an average of 53  deg  c  the dark gray got an average of 48  deg  c  and light gray got an average of 45  deg  c  but the white got an average of 42  deg  c  so it should be white 
white  it white because white would keep the dog house coler than all the other coior
dark gray  the color might affect the inside of the dog house because the average temperature is 48  deg  c  and in trial 1  2  and 3 the temperature was 48  deg  c also 
black  a black dog house will hold heat better than anyother color i know this because in the lid experiment blacks air temp ature had the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white 
black  black is the best at capturing and keeping he at  its average heat was 53
black  with a darker color during the winter the dog wouldnt be as cold  with black the average tempreture would be 53  deg  c  the diffrence between white and black was 12  deg  c hotter in the black jar then the white jar 
white  white would effect the inside of the dog house because white clearly kept the air temperature inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black  dark gray  or light gray  the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42  deg  c while the average for the black lid was 53  deg  c  that is a difference of 11  deg   although the dark gray lid and the light gray lid didnt have such an extreme difference from the white lid  the dark and light gray lid still rose the air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature which was 24  deg  c  also on average the black lid rose the air temperature in the glass container 29  deg  c from the starting temperature while the white lid only rose the air temperature 18  deg  c from the starting temperature on average  that is a difference of agian 11  deg  c 
white  if brandi and jerry use white  the dog house wont be as hot  or higher temperature  because white attracts the least amount of heat 
white  i think that white would be the color because according to the experiment  white had the lowest temperature so the dogs wouldnt get to hot 
black  it will give it more air and light for the dog
white  it might affect it because the darker the color the hotter it is
light gray  i chose light gray because say its a really cold day outside  and your dog is inside his doghouse  ill bet hes really happy that you didnt chose to paint it white instead 
light gray  if you choose cark grey the inside of the dark house wont be to warm or to cold  when you used black it had an average of 53 degrees because the darkness is absorbing all of the heat  the white on the other hand is 42 degrees adn isnt absorbing as much of the warmness  you would nt want the doghouse to be to warm or to hot so if you chose light the dog could have a perfect tempeture  becasue he already has a thick fur line keeping him warm and we would want him to become so warm and become faint  so light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae is better
white  i chose white because the color white does not absorb as much heat as black so the white would keep the dog cooled when it is hot 
light gray  they liked it becuse they like dog houses
black  if brandi and jerry increased the darker the doghouse  black  then the doghouse will be a lot hotter because the darker the dog house the more energy is absorbed 
white  based on the data white will make the dog house cooler  light colors dont absorb as much heat as dark colors  in conclusion white would be the best color for the hot weather 
black  acorrding the expirement  the black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside the jar to be higher  therefore making a blackpainted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors 
light gray  light gray is the best color for a doghouse because a black dog house is too hot for the dog  being 53  deg  c on average  the white doghouse would be too cold from only having 42  deg  c inside  the only options left are dark gray and light gray  but with the heat coming off from the dog itself  more heat will circulate around the doghouse  therefore  light gray  with 45  deg  c on average  would be abetter color to paint a doghouse than dark gray  with 48  deg  c on average 
white  if it is white then the air in the dog house will stay cool on hot days 
white  they should use white because the average temperature of white was 42  deg  c  and the average temp of black was 53  deg  c  therefore  the color white would keep the dog coolest 
dark gray  a dark gray dog house would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot in the sun  in the experiment the jar with the dark gray lid didnt have the hottest or the coldest air inside 
white  le color se be mas bonito que los otros 
white  the color white will keep away the heat on hot summer days keeping the doghouse cool 
dark gray  the color dark gray will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse warm  not too hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter  the data table on lid color vs  air temperature inside glass jar says that the average temperature for dark gray lid is 48  deg  c  this shows that it is a good temperature for most weather 
white  this will make the doghouse the coolest becas ue its average data was only 42 degrees c  this will keep the dog the coolest during the summer time
black  the color of the doghouse being black will best maintain heat during cold seasons or periods of time  during the hotter seasons  the dog occupying the house will have no need of the doghouse  thus  overheating is not an issue 
black  black is not a good color bacause it exstract s heat from the sun and and the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and thats why they should not choose the color black 
white  white will keep the inside of the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside  the average for white is 42  deg  instead of black being 53  deg  
white  because  it will keep you more warmer 
white  white would make the dog house colder
white  the color white would be the best for the dog house because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the doghouse cool and comfortable
light gray  the light gray color will keep a maintained normal temperature
white  i would paint it white so on a hot summer day brandi and jerrys dog could cool down 
black  this color will affects the doghouse internal temperature  the darkness of the color will absorb heat energy and keep the inside of this dog house warm 
black  becues is black
white  the white paint would make the doghouse cooler the black paint would make the doghouse warmer at 53 degrees celicus  the white paint would be 42degrees celcius 
white  it will make the dog house cool for the dog on hot days 
black  beacuse it can be warm inside the dog house if the sun hits the black paint it can be hot in there and change the temp ature
black  el negro por que el negro consume el calor y el blanco no
white  white would be the best color because the temperature in the inside of the dog house would be colder than any other color
white  the dog house should be painted white because it would make the dog house the coolest  coldest   since dogs like the shade and cold to cool them down in the summer  white would reflect the most light energy and prevent it from becoming too hot  after ten minutes  the jar with the black lid heated up by 29 degrees c on average  however  the jar with the white lid didnt heat up at all on average 
black  having a black doghouse will b warmer 
white  white is the best color because it keeps it very cool  lighter colores like white reflex the sun lite that makes it more cool and darker coolors like black absord that makes it more hot
light gray  i picked light gray becuase i thought i didnt want the dog to be to hot in there by having it black or dark gray but then again i didnt want the dig to have white just in case he wont get to cold so i picked light gray so heshe will feel just right
white  i would choose white colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the expiriment where black was for the first trial  54  deg  c  then for the last trial also 54  deg  c  where as white at its first trial got 42  deg  c and 41  deg  c for its last trial
light gray  since the doghouse will have a living being in it  the temperature should be comfortable for the dog  53  deg  c is very  very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable  especially on a warm summer day  but  41  deg  c is too cold for a dog in the winter time  as this would be a yearround house for the dog  so  45  deg  c would be less hot in the summer  and more warm in the winter  which is just perfect for the dog 
white  it wont exorb that much heat so it will cool insiode the dog house
white  white will keep the doghouse at a cooler temperature than any of the other colors will  thus preventing the dog from over heating  this is proven by the fact that after ten minutes  ajar wit ha white lid had an increased temperature of 18  deg  c  while jars with darker lids  ranging from light gray to black  had an increase in temperature of anywhere from 21  deg  c to 29  deg  c  the white lid kept the jar cooler  so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well  this is healthier for the dog 
black  the color black would effect the air tempature of the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorbe more energy 
black  if you painted the outside of a doghouse  then the inside would be warmer  no matter what color you painted the inside 
white  white would be the best color to chose for the doghouse  because white reflects off the sun  it doesnt absorb it like black  dark grey  or grey 
dark gray  the best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because its close to median of the data  also  the average temperature for dark gray is 48  deg  c  this shows that the color can absorb and reflect light  so in cold days the doghouse will stay warm and on hot days the temperature inside the doghouse will be cooler 
dark gray  it will keep the temperature the same at all times
white  the white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out  from the experiment  the white lid was the coolest out of all four lids 
white  white will keep the doghouse cool becuase it reflects light instead of absorbing it
white  white will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black  white had a average of 42  deg  c and black was 53  deg  c 
light gray  light gray was the color i would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because  since black absorbs the most energy and the inside would have been hot  dark gray would have done the same thing as black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed  light gray would have been a perfect color  not only absorbing the perfect amount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors black and dark grey 
light gray  as shown in experiment that brandi and jerry conducted  we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs  knowing this  we wouldnt want the dog to get overheated  so we would panint the dog house the lightest color available  which in this case  is white  though  the dog  being alive creature shouldnt get too cold  therefore  light gray is the perfect compromise  keeping the dog warm enough  but not too hot 
black  this color black  could affect the doghouse because the dog could get very hot in the summer time  also  the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun and start to erode 
dark gray  i chose dark gray because it stayed the same heat every trial so it wouldnt be to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter
white  durring the experiment  brandi and jerry found out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it  if the white color was painted apon the top of the dog house  then the temperature wouldnt rise as much as the black coored paint because  jerry and brandi made there experiment and got the results of white having the least affected air temperature when a lamp is directed at the jar  for example  on trial 1  the white container had an air temperature of 42  deg  c versis the air temperature in the black jar of 54  deg  c 
light gray  its cool but it gets some heat for the dog
white  its going to be cooler for the dog in the inside than the darker colors because they do absorb more energy and that will make the doghouse very hot in the inside 
light gray  light gray could affect the inside of the dog house cause the color is not to dark so that it wont be to hot and its not to light so it wont be to cold the temperature will be just fine 
white  it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors becuase it stayed in a termperature of low 40  deg  c  light gray was in high mid 40  deg  c  dark gray in high 40  deg  c  and black was in low 50  deg  c proving that lighter colors keep the air temperature cooler
light gray  i picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat  so that means lighter colors help reflect  light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a little  and in the some helps reflect a good amount 
black  they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be absorbed  the black lid was an average of 5  deg  warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house
light gray  the tempature of the dog house would be from 44  deg  c to 46  deg  c  the dog house will be at a neutral condition because it will not be too hot or too cold
light gray  i choose dark gray because the light grey is perfect say that its a could wet day the dog is really could  the dog could go into the dog house and stay warm with out being over welmed with he at from his body and fur  the colors averge tempurture was 48 degrees ce lceas it keeps most of the temp in but leaving some out  also it gragulla y was getting warm at a slow pace wich would help the dog alot when it gets to summer time so he dosnt get over heated  buy the suns heat
dark gray  dark gray is better because it will get hotter in the doghouse but not too hot 
white  the heat would be less atracted to white than the rest of the colours
white  it wont make it as hot itll make it cooler
