list and describe three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
1they do mitosis so they can stay alive if one cell is dying2more substances come in then out3cell get rid of the stuff they dont need for the cell
mitosis meosis translation
1 the plasma membrane itself helps to control the movement of some substances by letting them in or keeping them out2 the golgi apparatus regulates the movement of substances across the cell membrane3 the endoplasmic reticulum helps to regulate the movement of substances across the cell membrane as well
the cell can tell the substances to move across the membrane because the cells need to move to get to the place where they need to go
the membrane recognizes and lets needed protiens go into the cellosmosis is a way they keep the liquid in the cell equal to the liquid outside of the cellplants use a cell wall to protect the cell and keep out big things and let the little things in
1the structure og the cells is the same2living cells come from another living cell3 cells come from cells
respirationmovement of foods and protiens in and out of the cell
1 the postion of the cell sometimes wont let the cell move2 the flagella will grab hold of something on the side to where it will be stuck until it lets go3 the procees of the cell will stay in one place until its procees is complet
cellular wall
first they decide if the substances is good or bad they insepct the substances by telling if its a protein or a diease  secound they elimanate the bad substances if the substance is good they let it go throw third  they ship or store some of the protiens
proteins are carried by ribosomes to the golgi apparatuslipids are stored in the cell membrane to later be sent all over the cellstuff that needs to be obstructed from the cell is decomposed by the lysosomes that travel throughout the cell
osmosis mitosis and cytosis
osmosious controls the movement of water across the celldiffusion controls how gentic information is moved to another cellsodium potassioum pump moves sodium and potassioum around the cell through tubes
all cells are livingsome cells make other cells
transportation so the cell can move particles across the plasma membranehomeostacis so the cell can do its job normally
the membrane is permeable which allows smaller cells to go through membranes have cells that create openings for larger cells
anaphase cells splittelophase cells start to splitprophase nuclear membrain dissapers
cell wall controls what goes in and outcell membrane also controls what goes in and outnucleus conrtols what the cell does
the cell membrane uses enzymes
philanges and tiny hairlike structures on the outside of a cell that help the cell gather food and sometimes even move ionic channels only let in certian amounts of certain substances this controls the amount of protiens getting into the cell the parts of a cell are held together by the cytoplasm and membrane this does not allow for foreign things to be able to penetrate the cell
cell respiration
osmosis is used to move molecules across the cells permiable membrane  also the protein carriers to determine what can move through or across the membrane
equilbrium of substances from higt to low concertrion  diffusion the excreation of water and waste from the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane include keeping all the healthy cells healthy getting rid of the bad cells and maintaining a smooth environment
into and out of the cell
trna is a movement of a type of cell across the cell membrane
three processes are when the cell usese other cells the use of cilai and flagilia
the cells use active transport osmosis and diffusion to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane in active transport the substances move thought the opening tubes in the cell membrane to get into the cell they osmosis the substances need to be small so they can pass through the membrane lastly in diffusion they difuse into the cell
replication
cells use the process of diffusion to take in the substances the protiens in the plasma membrane change their shape to carry substances throught the membrane and into the cell osmosis also brings substances into the cell by bringing them in through the water around the cell
cillia these are short hair like projections that cover the outside of the cellcell membrain a barier that lets protiens and food in and out of the cells baodycell wall also a baier but on plants it helps take in light and releses excces water
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are being selectively or semipermeable osmosis and diffusion
active transport inactive transport and escort transport
carries protien
homeostasis
osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane transportation through the hols of a cell membrane is another and the other is when they leave through lysosomes
they can carry nutrients across
the cell uses the er to move things throughout the cell  it moves protiens around through its winding tubesthe cell uses the mrna to move information throughout the cellthe cell uses the vacuole to move waste throughout the cell
the cells control movement of substances by sending things into the endoplasmic reticulum and once inside the substances get moved and exit through the exoplasmic reticulum then they leave the body through digestion
the cells movement is controlled by the cell membrane it controls what comes into the cell and what leaves the cell although the nucleus controls the cell and tells it to move the membrane does most of the work
cells use diffusion to transfer water across the membrane they also use protien holes to move the larger substances some things that they move across simply pass through the membrane
1 the cell can control the membrane cause its part of the cell2 the cell can control the membrane like we can do same to ours3the cell sends a it threw littel tiny cells to the membrane
1     osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane 2     active transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell3     passive transport is where an enzyme opens the cell but the object doesnt need the extra energy to come in
the cytoplasm which caries it on the substance
the er is used to direct things leaving the nucleus or help things move through out the cellthe golgi apperatus directs vacules around the cell
cells use diffusion to move substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until it reaches equilibrium  cells also use osmosis which is diffusion but with water
cells have protective layers that could prevent harmful substances from entering throug the cell membrane
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion paricles moving from high to low consentration osmises
osmosis balancing water levelsdiffusion of cell materialsmrna leaving the nucleus
the cell can move because of the nucleus the cell wall is located behind the cell membrane so i thank this would  have something to do with iti aslo thank it is the mitochrondia
one is the edoplamick reticulum and two is the cell mimbraint
1 golgi apperatus2 lysosomes3 endure rectal
1 the nucleous tells the mitocontria to send a signal to the cell membrane2 the cell membrane gets the message and tells the cytoplasm to start to push things around3 after that everything gets moved into place
enzymes catalist eukaryotes
the movement of substances has to make its way through the cell membrane the membrane only allowes a few people to go at a time
one of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis osmosis moves water down the cell membrane the last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodiumpotassium pump the sodiumpotassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane
use of the membrane of the cell helps create movement
active transport facilitated diffusion and osmosis
diffusion osmosis endocytosis
three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion secretion and absorption
the cells absorb the thing and they carry it to where ever it is supposed to go and they start that proces again
one is by moving the cell away from harmful areas another is moving the harmful stuff from the cell and bringing in the good stuff lastly the cell can move its self to places where it can get more food or water etc
one would be going in the vacule and being use for energytwo would be useing the mrna to leave the cellthrid would be being used for food for the cell
the cell slide through the membrane then the cell breaks into piecsand the cell eats
active transport is where the cell uses energy to move the substancespassive transport is where the cell does not use energy to move the substancesdiffusion is where cells release energy
1 they move with the flagellumso they can move throughout the cells2 by ribosomes so they can send energy through out the cell3 or by sending messages to one another
the outer membrane of the cell controls how much goes in and out of the cell  through the process of osmosis water moves in or out of a cell depending on if there is a higher or lower concentration within the cell  another way they control this is by the growing of the outer membrane  if there is too much of a substance within the cell it will break apart to allow enough room
1 golgi apparatus     2 endoplasmic reticulum3mitochondria
nerve cells tell the membrane where it is and the membrane uses that imformation to move it
diffusion the process of using water to move across the membranemeiosis the changing of a cell to move or take up space
the golgi aperatis acts as the bodies ups man to transport materialflagela is used by certain organisms to move
one process used by cells to control the movement of substances is when the membrane has different ways of letting different molecules enter
1 golgie apratus2 lysomoes3 endoplasmic recticulum
the ribsomes carry it throughout the cellthe mitocandria carries it to the nucleusthe clear liquid stuff carries it through the cell as well
one process that is used by cells to control the movement of different substances across the cell membrane is the fllagellum the flagellum protects and moves the cell
three processes that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is protein synthesis transfusion and moving waste out
reproduction respiratin and food gatherinmg
they dont let anything enter the cell membrane
three of the processes used in the cell membrane is diffusion transfusion and the letting in of substances into the cell
one way is when there is more liquid outside of the cell water enters the cell to make an equilibrium another way is if there is more liquid in the cell water will leave the cell
they use their membrane to filter things in and out of the cell then proteins take watever it is to be used
cell wall which controls what goes in and out of the cellnucleas is the brain of the cellcentermitochondria is the power house helps keep things moving
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell memebrane are osmosis diffusion exocytosis these three all help control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
osmosis is one process that moves water from a high concentration area to a lower concentration area this makes it even throughout the whole cell diffusion is another process that moves water from a low area of concentration to a high area of concentration activation is another process it
nuclear envelope it is used to take waste out of the celllysosomes
they can control them they can redirect them and they can get rid of them
one processe used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be cell reprodution
1 mitosis2 meosis3protein synthesis
over time the cells change an take different forms
mosmis diffisen miosis
cell diffusion cell respiration and cell exertion
the first way cells control the movement of substance is by waste removal wich will allow the substance to leave the body  the second way is by mrna which allows the cell to grab hold of it and release it to the waste the third way is by letting it be filtered while it goes through the body
1diffusion is something moving arcoss the surface of the cell membrane and then entering the cell it requires little energy2theres also spots were things can get through the cell but it requires more energy then diffusion3and the cell can just allow something in side it
1  it uses the energy from the membrane                                 2 it uses the light from the membrane3 it uses the food from the membrane to makeit there and sometimes back to the spot it came from it only makes the trip maybe three times
they use the a chemical proccess of enzymes the membrain also and through channels in the membrain
three processes that cells use to control movement across the cell membrane are proteins phospholipids and vesicles the substances hook on to the protein and are transfered into the cell with phospholipids the substance is absorbed and goes through the membrane into the cell vesicles form around the substance and carry it into the cell
the cell wall blocks and keeps substances from crossing into the membrane
osmosisthe act of transporting water through a selectively permeable membrane  active transportthe forced movement of a nutrient or mineral through the cell by pores on the cell membrane
cells use ribosomes mitochondria and lysosomes to move substances across the cell ribosomes carry out protiens mitchondria are the powerhouse and provide energy lysosomes which come from the golgi apparatus carry out sugars
diffusion the cell transports the material across the cell membrane so the concentration is equal on both sidesosmosis the transportation of water across the cell membrane
cell resperation
the cell uses three processes these three processes are pushing where the cell pushes the substance crossing the membrane the second process that a cell uses is carrying the substance across the membrane and the third one is steering where the cell steers the substance in order for it not to crash
movement helps the membrane move resirpation helpts it eat and drinkwalk help it move also
some cells use diffusion in which matter moves from an aea of higher concentraion to  an area of lower concentration cells also use osmosis where water moves froman area of lower concentration to an rea of high concentration thirdly the use active transport in which the cell uses its own energy to move nurients through its membrane
cytoplasmjello like solution that is there for them cell to swim throughflagellahas a tail that helps move them throughout the membraneciliamoves cell
meosis is one way that cells move substances mitosis is another way that cells move substances the last way that a cell moves substances is telephase
it can be moved by mrnatrnaand cells
mitosis  prophaseand metaphase
osmosis mitosis diffusion the movement of water in and out of the cell
electric currents through the spinal cord going directly to the brain
cells use osmosis active transport and facilitated transport to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane osmosis occurs when water and other materials move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration active transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using the cells energy facilitated transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using a mixture of energy from the cell and energy from the products

diffusion osmosis and
enrgycells and
the cell could not move very fast the cell could not be able to move at allthe cell could move across the cell membrane
three processes used by cells to control movement across the cell membrane are first osmosis in which water moves in and out of the cell through the membrane second
protiensgolgie apparatusenzymes
1nucleus  2cell wall 3the microondran
cell wall only lets some stuff throughgolgi aparatus controls waste
trnamrnarrna
cells choose what to let in
diffusion of a substance with in a cell
passive transportactive transoprtdiffusion
move
the cells control movment by blood flow the size of the cell and the movement of the cell
diffusion is the movement of water over cells meiosis is the process in which a substance moves over cell membrane for a short period of time mitosis is the process in which water or another substance is moved over a membrane for a long period of  time
the cell membrane only lets certain things across  the membrane osmosis has a permeable layer that allows only certain things across the membranethe golgi apparatus packages and moves substances across the cell
three processes are1 mitochondrian 2 lysosomes3
felgella
three processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the nucleus flagellum and ribosomes
to get food the nucleas to get shape is the cell wall also to reproduce they die off
osmosis allows water in to the cell membrane reverse osmosis brings water out and
the cell membrane is on example of an organelle that controls the movement of substances by having a permeable membrane which decides whether something can enter or leave the cellalso diffusion is when something is transferred in this case in the cell the cell uses diffusion to gain things that are necessary for the cell to live also the last is osmosis which is diffusion in water this helps water enter and leave the cell helping th ecell to regulate their processes
diffusion osmosis transfusion
one way is the golgi apparatus another is mitochondria and the third is mrna
they use diffusion which they use cells along the membrane to detect things crossing the membrane they use osmosis which is the crossing of water over the membrane and they use their mitochondria which move waste out of the cell
the ion channel is one of the three it allows ions to pass through the cell membranethe sodiumpotaseum pump is the second of the three
they are passed through various organelles
dna translated to rna translated to protiens
cell use of the process called photosynthesis a process which the cell gets its food fromcells also use the process with the help of mitochondria so they recieve energy
they help them movethe are a celll in a membraneand they control the movement of substances
diffussion is random movement across a cell membrane
first the organism takes in the food then it breaks it down finall decomposure takes place
proteins and sugars
first the cell can move water across the cell by using osmosis  the cell can also use a process caled respiration which is when the cell moves oxygen across it and the third is waste removal
one cell controls the movementone cell controls figellaone cell the celius moves the cell
the cell wall only lets in the good thingsthe cell membrane helps the other parts of the celldna  also go though the cell membrane to get checked out for rna
three processes used by celss to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are osmosis passive and assertive these help to move different things across a cell osmosis moves only water across a cell membrane passive uses no energy to move proteins across a cell membrane assertive uses energy to move proteins acorss a cell membrane
1 they start from one part of the body and move too the given area they need2 mrna3 trna
one way to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is prophase menaphese and telephase
osmosis the movement of waterdiffusion the movements of particles from high to lowactive transport is when the cell uses energy to open and close and allow certain particles in and out
active transport movement of proteins
their is a cell wall for plants to protect them selves from bieng hurtthe cell memabrane controls what enters and exit the cell at all timesthe nucleuse tells how the cell to function so it controls the cell membrane and tells it what can enter and what cant
when molecules are added to a cell they grow wider this process is called hypotonic when molecules leave the cell this is called hypertonic and when molecules pass through a barrier in the cell this is called osmosis
some process can be used to move the substances across the cell membrane one is the funtion of the cell two is the cells cytoplasm and three can be used for the making of the cell that makes the cell come alive and make everything happen
one of the three proccesses is when the cells travel through the blood flow
one process is the use of the flagellum it is used like a whip to move things from one place to the other another process is the cell puts a protien in a bubble like structure to move it through the cytoplasm also a cell uses a protien to move things around
difusion movement of particles across a membraneosmosis movement of water across a membranefucilited diffusion movement of large particles across a membrane with help from proteins
interphaseprophasetelophase
diffusion osmosis and
to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane flagellum cilium and carrier proteins are used flagellum are long whiplike structures used for movement cilium are short hairlike structures carrier proteins are also often used
flagellas is a tail that allows the cell to swim around slime allows cells to move around and little tenticles on outside of cell to help swim around
the membrane just let the thing that has to go out out and the stuff that has to get in get in
reconizing the celllets out emzymes to attack
the cell membrain is used to let things in and out of the cell the nucleus is the brain of the cell and controlls where it goes the genes inside of the cell can tell where each cell go
diffusion movement from high to low concentration  facilitated diffusion energy and protein is moved from low to high concentration  osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane
ummconvection currents and
ribosomes chloraplast cell wall
they can put stuff in the flow of the blood streem for easier movmentthey can fight off bad substances to make the movment more smooththey can use some substances to make scabs if nessecary
the cells have channels the cell wall controls what can come in and what can go out the channels take the subtances to different parts of the cell
1 they confront it to see if its a bad substance or a good one2 if its bad they willl destroy it3if its a good substance it will adapt to it
selective entering only certain things can get in the cell open entry where anything can come in it
deffisonosmosis
bloodnervescell tissue
the three process of dna are mrna trna and grna
mitochondrine flagella
photosynthesis reproductionprotection
osmosis this process lets water based substances flow through the membrane of the celldiffusion this process lets substances go throught the cell membranemeosis this process opens up a part of the cell membrane to let bigger substances go though the cell membrane
mitosis the cell splits up to a sister as they call itmiosis the sister chromatid grows
cells use passive transport through methods of diffusiion and osmosis and also have the abilirty to use active transport with functions such as exoendocytosis and sodium potassium pumps
selective permiablity which lets only certain things pass like a window screenendocytosis brings in certain substances by opening the plasma membrane and absorbing themexocytosis uses the same process as endocytosis except its removing substances from the cell
there are many processes that control the movement of substances across the cell membrane but three of the processes are the movement through the cells selectively permeable membrane the movement of waste products by the lysosmes and the excretion of protiens for the use of the rest of the body
the cell membrane is used to protect the cell the cell wall is used to block any harmful things out
one process cells use to control the movement of substances across the area is osmosis  osmosis is when a substance passes through water to move from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient  a second process used to help control the movement is diffusion  diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient  a third process to help control movement is facilitated diffusion where particles are used to help the movement from the high to low concentration gradients
the processes are active transport diffusion and passive transport
cell wall is the first form of protection for the cell which controls what comes in and goes out of the cell the second peice of protection is the cell membranewhich also helps filture the things coming and going
1 mitosis2 meiosis3 reproduction
one process is osmosis which helps moves water in and out of the cell another process would be going through the protein channels this moves things in and out of the cell a third process would be isomosis
one process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis cells use osmosis to either gain or get rid of water by passing it across the cell membrane      another process used by cells is cellular diffusion this is like osmosis it is the process of substances moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
cells use the process called diffusion  diffusion is used to move the substances across the cellosmosis is used to move water across the cell translation occurs to move substances  transciption also moves the substances across the cell membrane
the cell membrane controls what goes in and what goes out of the cell sometimes there are spaces in the membrane allowing tiny things to get through it
every cell from a cell
the cell membrane can only let certain things in and out of the cells
1reproduction2movement3energy
the first process is miosisthe second is
it pushes unwanted waste out
1 they have the same functions2
the selective permeibility of the cell lets some things in and out but not others
cells can move by trna
miosis
some had tails that they used to move  they were alive so they could move  they combined with eachother ta make a bigger cell
the cell uses a process called osmis to mave water across the membranewater diffusion help move the water from one side of the membrane to the other side
flagellum a tail like structure used to swim aroundcilia hairlike structures that whip around providing movementanother one is where the organism extends out sections of its cell membrane and fills it with cytoplasm while the opposite end goes away and it moves by a crawling type movement
cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane active transport is a process used where the cell uses energy and transport proteins to move substances in and out of the cell osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane and finally passive transport requires no energy and moves with the concentration gradient to move substances across the cell membrane via transport proteins
anaphasetelophasemetophase
1nucleus2michrocondria3
the nucleus is the one that tells the other cell parts what to do so it gives the order then the ribosomes transport the substance out of the nucleus
the cell uses the nucleus to move the cell uses the mitochondria to move substances the cell uses the reticulums to move substances also
diffusion     osmosis
movement move the cell to its destination growth gets bigger for more length speed is the main priority to get to its destination
they control regulation by having little holes that let substances through substance that are to big are not aloud through
osmosis the movement of water through a celldiffusion the movement of molecules through the cellpassive transport the movement of particles through a body without using energy
they control the movement of substances across the cell membrane by
the cells control the movement of substances across the cell membrane because they control the blodd flow
reproduction
translation carries the substances on the mrna to the trnatranscription moves the substances on the trna to the rrna where they are moved to the ribosome
prophase anaphase and telophase
the cell uses the flagellum to move easier the move easier throught the cell the cell also uses it cell wall in order to keep the substances in the cell the third process the cell uses is its nucleus to control the cell
1 active transport is a process that requires energy because it moves substances against their concentration gradient2 simple diffusion is a type of passive transport that moves substances down their concentration gradient this process requires no energy3 facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses protein to move substances across the cell membrane no energy is required for this process
1 mitochondrion2 cytoplasm3 nucleus
one process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis osmosis is the controlled amount of water that goes through the membrane of the cell another process is diffusion diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane this monitors the substances that go through the semipermeable membrane only some substances can leave and only some may enter the third process is the permeability of the cell the cell is semipermeable so it will only let in some of the substances that try to enter the cell
the  processes that the cel uses to control the movemetn of substances across the cell membrane is by having the rule of high concentration to low concentration and also low concentration to high concentration if a substance is trying to move across the cell membrane then that substance will have to be able to move for low to high or high to low concentrations
difusion facillitated difusion osmosis
cells have protein channels that direct the movement of substances in and out of the cell osmosis is the process in which outside substances can penetrate through cell membrane diffusion is the process of substances moving on a gradient from high to low
ingulf or eating food absorbtion asorbing waste removal
there are a few processes used by cells to control the movement of the substances across the cell three examples include homeostasis diffusion and meiosis
the cells membrane only allows certain objects to enter the cellthey also use the nuclei to help kind of filter what goes across and into the cell the other things they use is a cell wall of course only in plant cells
cells use many things to move things defusion is one way another would osmoses and i do not know a third so yes
useing organelles
1 they are connected to the membrane so that they can controll movement2 they are feeding the membrane giving it nutrients and such to make it work better3there is a thick gell that allows only the movement of substances pass through
one process used by cells is energy that functions the cell membranethe second process used by cells is the cell wall keeping the cell membrane protectedthe third process used by cells is the nucleus control everything to keep the movement on track
they use the cell membrane to transport certain types of things into and outside the cell they can use the cytoplasm inside to halp also move things they use proteins to transport thing around the cell
1 osmosis the equilzation of water in and outside the cell2 organelles which prevent unessesary functions3 the nucleus the brain of the cell
the cells carry subtances along the membrane to other places in the body they also use their platelets to stop things
iht obtains sugar nd vacculs
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mrna enzymes and lipids all three of the processes help control movement mrna also helps transfer dna across the membrane to amino acids in protein
selective permabilitymitosis
anaphase prophase interphase
active transport using energy to move something across the membraneinactive transport no energy needed to move a substance across the membranefacillitated diffusion inactive transport that uses proteins to move a substance across the membrane
diffusion is when a liquid is transferred across a membranephagocytosis is when an object is enveloped by the membrane
golgi bodies for packaging waste products lysosomes used to eat away at the wastes er used to move ribosomes
blood clots that way the blood wont get out of control
1 they block other organisms from entering the cell membrane2 they help build a wall to keep things out3 they kill off bad organisms
1protein channells only allow certain things through     2the cell membrane only aloows in small things     3active transport
1 the cells only let certain cells in 2 they use little holes in the outer layer to let substances in3 they fight off any bacteria or anything they dont want on the cells membrane
osmosisexocytosisdiffusion
photosynethsis helps a plant survivecell splilting to make two cellsbreathing
the cell membrane moves substances near the nucleaus as new cells form the membrane starts to multiply as the cells do
one prcess is the use of the semipermeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell in plants their cell wall controls what can get into the cell membrane by acting as a barrier from outside organisms

ossmosis nucluesphotosinthisis
1 active transport help ot go from cell to cell and get its protein2 inactive transportdoes not help it get its protein adn reproduce3diffusionuses energy to help the plantscells grow
they transfer the dna they store proteins and collect enzymes they do all of that so that the cell can function
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are flagenal bristles and rebosomes
the proteins control what gets in and out of the cell membraneif something is too big to get through the membrane it can stretch to make room polar heads face out inside and outside of the cell membrane because there is water on both sides nonpolar tails are smooshed in between the polar heads so they dont touch water
three processes used by the calls to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are cellular resparation photosynthesis and cell division
one process used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrans is the cell wall another processes but wich cells use to control the substances that cross the cell membranes are the phospholipids that line that cell wall these help keep unwanted thing out as well lastly one last process used by cells to control the movment of substances across the cell membrans are membranes thar act as little doors that open and close to let thing inside
active transportfacilated diffusion   simple diffusion
osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell neither of these require energy for the cell to use active transport on the other hand is a process of movement which does require energy
the purpose of the membrane is to help pass over the stuff your  body takes in or needs it separates the good stuff and the bad
they devide into 2 and multply
difussion movement of substance across the cell membrane without using energyactive transport movement of a substance across the cell membrane using energyosmosis water diffusion
nucleus nucleolis golgi apparatus
1 cells can use passive transports which is where there is no energy used2 cells can use active transports which is where there is energy used
1 the cell cycle
they have flagella to help them move the substances across the cell membrane the cell membrane also chooses if the bacteria or substance can enter then the cell uses active transport
the cells send a message to the brain when something is going wrong like if you touch a hot stove the cells send a message saying hey this is hot and your hand then knows to move away
diffusion  the cell allows materials to pass through the membraneosmosis  the cell allows water to pass through the membrane
transfusion
1 they are small
the cell membrane controls them by having openings only certain substances can go in by making a substance that wont allow them to come in and by letting some in
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transive transport
the cells absorb it and carry it to where it has to go the cell pushes it the cell flows with it to make it go where it has to go
one is a selectively permeal membrane which only allows what is neccessary to move across the cell membrane another is homeostasis which keeps everything stabilized and a last one is osmosis which allows things to move about the cell membrane
theyve got the cell wall so not everything can come in or out
three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are osmosis diffusion and active transport active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration also osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration
osmosis moves water through the cell membrane
controlling movement
the three processes used are trna dna and flagellum to control the movement of substances through the cell membrane
cells use
organelles
1 the cells allows what goes into the membrane2 the cells allow what goes out of the membrane3 it controls how the membrane allows the cell to reproduce
well they can move they reproduce and they have some crazy thing called a cell wall
osmosis is the passing of things across a membrane meiosis and mitosis
the membrane will split som that certain substances can pass through
cells use the flagella
cell wall it prevents things from coming in and going out
ribosomes mitochondria and the nucleus
they have the same cells so they can move from place to place
one process is active transport which cells do to get proteinsanother process is when cells multiplethe last proces is when the cells reproduce
the cytoplasm moves the ribosome around in the cell the endoplasmic reticulum moves the ribosomes into the nucleus the golgi apparatus removes the unwanted substances out of the cell
protiens entering cell to helpviruses disguising as proteins and entering cellnucleus sending mrna to get things it needs from outside the cell
mitchondriadouble the cellcell wall  control what come in and out
osmosis  the diffusion of water through celldiffusion  allowing materials through the membrane
transport of substances across the cell membrane diffusionwhich is the process of moving matter and materials from one end to the other
translation obsorbs food endocytosis when food enters exocylosis when waste exits
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the sodium potassium pump endocytosis and exocytosis      the sodium potssium pump pumps sodium ions out and potassium ions in it is a form of active transport     endocytosis moves large materials into the cell by the use of a vesicle it is a form of active transport     and exocytosis moves large materials out of a cell by the use of a vesicle it is also a form of active transport
the nucleus holds all the dna and controls the cells functions the proteins help control what passes through the cell membrane the cell membrane also determines what comes in and out of the cell
the three procedures that a cell uses to move things across the cell membrane are one it finds out where its going too two it transports it using flagellum and three it gets to its destination
wateroxygenprotein
the first type of movement is called active transport in this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane this type of movement requires energy from the cell an example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration the next for of transport is facilitated diffusion in this type of transport the cell does not use energy an example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration the last process is passive transport this is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy
active transport diffusion against the concentration gradientpassive transport diffusion along the concentration gradientdiffusion the random movement of praticles from an area of high concentraion to low concentration
1 absorbing nutrients    cells must absorb nutrients in order to live 2 producing offspring    they must also reproduce to not become extinct3 adapting to natural habitats    cells must be able to be comfortable where they lie in order to survive they must be familiar with it and know how to live in it
osmosis water is moved through the cell
facilitaded diffusion
flagella cellium
one is the protein channel and it helps control how much of that substance goes through two is the cell membrane which tells the substace where to go and how much of it to go three is the mitochondria it also tells how much subtance goes where and how much of it
1 the movemnets of substances acrosss the cell membrane flow through the blood streams23
metaphase slows it down to create the processtelaphasespeeds it up to create the process
osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave passive transport is when theres more of something in the cell than there is outside of it and so some leave the cell to create equilibrium or vice versa
diffusion to move substances across a cell membraneosmosis the diffusion of water into and out of a cellactive transport transporting substances through a cell
osmosis is when water passes through a barrier which is selectively permeable in the case of a cell diffusion is when the cell tries to reach equilibrium by choosing what enters the cell homeostasis is when an organism is in equilibrium with the environment
osmosis
1 anaphase2 telophase3 interphase4 prophase
the cell uses three basic processes for movement across the membrane one is the flagelum another the cytoplasm and finally the protein in the ribonucleis acid
1 there is the cell wall that only lets wanted materials pass2 then there is the cytoplasm that will capturesomething unwanted and get rid of it3 lastly there is the nuclear envelope that also only lets wanted materials get through so it helps protect the cell from harmfull things
it will have to go into phases reproduce
1photosynthisis2resperation3digestion
1 osmosiswater through the cell membrane2 diffusionmolecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration3 molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
substances that are passing out and going in through the menmbrane are wastes that have to go through phosphate groups osmosis which if water moving to an area of high concentration to and area of low concentration either makes the cell shrink or swell with water it could result in dehydration or overhydration thing thats are too big to pass through the cells pores are not allowed intrance nor exit wastes and food particles move in and out through the cells membrane
mitosis meiosis
three of the processes that cells use to control movement into and out of the cell membrane are protein channels that let substances pass through them endosymbiosis allows large substances to enter and exocytosis allow larger substances to exit the cell
osmosis is one kind of movement osmosis is the movement of particle across a cel membranediffusion is another kind of movement across a cell membrane it moves particles across it by breaking teh particle downactive transport is another way active transport uses energy to get the particles across it safely with out harming the cell
diffusion
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion osmosis and active transport diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration or with the concentration gradient osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient or from low to high concentration
your brain tells your body to do things and your body does them same in animalshumans and plants
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances acrosss the cell membrane are
some cells have a cell wall a cell wall controls what enters and exits a cell the cell membrane is very thick and can be very sensitive in what it receives into itcell membranes only have openings like doors to recieve certain sized things so anything unwanted can be left out
trna mrnarrna
1 the cell  outer wall membrane attaches with the rest of the structures and  functionsof the outer most cell2 the cells nucleus is the major working system that tells the other parts what to do a correspondent3 the cell cytoplasm moves waste and gathers nutrients from the entire cell to supply it with life
osmosis is used to move water across the cell membrane moves large particles across the cell membrane moves small particles across the cell membrane
the golgi apparatus brings in and take things that are neededthe mitocondria processes and store things until they are used
injection
cells move across the membrane with the use of osmosis diffusion and homostasis osmosis is when the cell determines what is and is not allowed to cross the cell membrane homostasis is when the cell is both equally stable on the inside and outside of the cell diffusion is when molecules are entering and leaving the cell
three processes that are udes by the cell to move substances across the cell membrane are the cell wall
passive transport which lets substances across the cell all the time  active transport lets substances move across the cell as well but active transport isnt used all the time  diffusion which is the movement of higher concentrations to lower concentrations
they use mrna to carry messages to the mitochondria and the cell somehow use that message or energy
1transcription2translation3 reflection
diffusion
mrna carries messages from the nucleus to other organstrna transports dna to places with in the cellrrna
1 cell membrane2 cell wall3 nucleus

osmosis active transportand diffusion
the cell membrane controls what comes in and out of the cellthe cell wall creates a outside barrier around the cell to protect it
cells divide carry oxygen to the brain deliver nutrents
osmosis the process in which water passes through a cell membranediffusion the process in which substances other than water pass through a cell membraneactive transport the process in which a cell uses atp as a source of energy to push substances through the cell membrane
these include passiveactive transport facilitated diffusion and osmosis passive transport does not require energy but active transport does passive transport is high to low concentration and active transport is low to high concentration facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane
this is movient control and by call across
the nucleus help with gathering substances also the ribsomes help keep them moving the chromotids help keep track of where everything is
osmosis rna and cell reproduction
1 cell membranes that allow enzymes to move across the cell 2 the nucleaus that controls all the chemical processes in the cell to maintain homeostasis3 the cell wall that allows only certain enzymes to enter and exit the cell
cellular respiration the respiration of cellscell division the dividing of cellscell frequencies frequency of cells
active transportwere enrgy is used to let something go out of the body because it is opposite of the flowpassive transportenergy is not used to have protiens or other materials pass through the membraneosmosiswere substances pass through the cell membrane because the cell has lower concentration then out side of the cell
osmosis flagellum diffusion
transportation
one way they try carry the substances across the cell membrance is that the cells will go through a special kind of door that only allows a certain kind of substance inanother way is that the special exits that let out a certain kind of substanceand finally the third one the way that they are moved into the cell through a door that allows both subtances into the cell
osmosis is the movement of water coming in or leaving the cell through the membrane diffusion is where the cell evens out the matter on the inside and outside of the cell
trnamrnarrna
with their bodys through blood and organs
the cell membrane uses everything in the cell to control what moves threw out the cell
1it controls the movment of your body movment2it helps you think3it hels the cell membrane understand
three processes used by the cell to control the movement of rsubstance acrosss the cell membrane is the cell wall the plasma membrane and the ezyme
osmosis is the movement with waterdiffusion transports materials through the memebranefacilitated diffusion
the first process is flagella is a tail like structure used for movementthe second process is called cilia it is little hairs that help move cellsthe third process is called transfer rna it moves around the cell getting information where it needs to go
the cell membrane is controlled
the cells us enzymes amino acids and chromosomes
the nucleus the cell wallthe sugars
osmosismoving water across the cell
it sends signs to allow that cell to cross over then it seems that the cells can reproduce
cells attach to other cells
slow the movement down they also can totally stop moving ment or they can let it go right through
felgelum
the cell membrane controls the traffic from one side to another side of the membrane
one way is the trna moves proteins to the cytoplasmanother way is through active transport active transport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane passive transport also moves substances out of the membrane but it does not require energy
passive transportationactive transportationdiffusion
cells are located in the cell membrane
the flagellim is used to cause the organism to move about 
the cell uses it little fingers to move things across the surface
mutation transcription and translation are three processes
the substancs is put in to the golgi and packaged then put through protine and passed through the cell wall
the cells in the plasma are controlled by the current within the cell then the nucleus opens and lets cell through
transfer
cells travel through the human body when they are needed it only takes a matter of seconds for them to get to where they are needed example if you got a scratch on ur knee the second its ripped open and there are diseases and bacteria trying to infect it there are anti bodies and white blood cells are fighting it off
flagellum
the cytoplasm moves substances around the cell the cell also uses protein synthesis to move proteins around the cell
they move from one place to another they all go to the human body they go threw the blood vessal
they take in enery from foodsthey use their own ways to move around and they have a shakey way of getting around things
active transport because with active transport the substances are active and moving around and not just staying in one placedeletion because it deletes some of the substances if they get in the way of something that way they can keep movingdiffusion because substances are kept moving and dont just stay still
1 they can go through doors called channel protein2 they can insert their key proetin to unlock the cell membrane in order to pass through3 they can be transported out of the cell by the organelles
osmosis endoplasmic reticulum
prophasemetaphaseanaphase
diffusion only allows certain particles to leave and enter the cellosmosis only allows a certain amount of water to go through the cellthe cell membrane  controls what enters and leaves the cell
protien enzyms rna
one of the proccesses is the cell wall that blocks anything from getting to the inside
flagellum silluim
1anaphase so anaphase means the chromosomes line up in the middle of the membrane2metaphase they then detach from each other3telephase they come back and reattach to each other
osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membraneby mitosis the cell is divided leaving more room for increased production and disposal of substancesthe golgi apparatus is used to diffuse substances such as removing damaged proteins from the cell
cell resperation it will give it so much oxegen to what needs the certain amout of oxygencell membrane keeps what cant fit in out and lets what is small enough to come inchannels that keep sertain thins though and would let what isnt made for that spacificaly out of the cell
they use the mitochondria to send messages
protiens control what goes out and in the cell they let things in through holes along the membrane only let what it needs in and out through
cells can move substances across the cell membrane by diffusion  also by respiration and osmosis  water diffuses through the cell membrane
osmosis is the process in which water can pass through a permeable membranediffusion allows little substance to pass through the cell membrane
mitosiosmieosis
pross
1oxygen profusion oxygen profuses through the air over the celll membrane 2cellular diffusion the substance diffuses through the cell membrane3 convection the substance goes through the cell membrane
the three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane are reproduction storing energy and movement  in reproduction the cell produces offspring  storing energy requires the cell to become more active  movement requires the cell to adapt to different places in the cell
the three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis active transport and passive transport osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semipermiable membrane and doesnt require any energy active transport is when molecules are getting diffused against the concentration gradient and passive transport is when molecules are diffused going with the concentration garadient
homeostasismetabolism
one way is the orgenes move itthere is searten parts of the cell that let it out
the nucleus gives instructions to the rest of the cellthe ribosomes move important things around and the cell wall lets things in or out
the nucluesenzymesprokayotes
cells control the movement of substances across the cell memebrane the three proceesses are the cell membrane moves out and in cellsalso it controls all the stuff in the cell membraneand also the cell membrane carrys stuff into the membrane
they enter through openings in the cell membrane there they are moved throughout the cell membrane through tubes finally they reach an opening and are released where they need to go
reproductionrespirationproteins
removes waist takes in martierials and
the cell uses openings in the membrane they move throgh it on ribosomes
active transport moves materials across the membranediffusion substances link with proteins to move across the membrane
the first process is to move it to the mitochdaine then they move it the to ensumyes the final movement they make is to the cell membrane
they send out messagesthey work togetherthey dont eat each other
1 the phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane 2 osmosis and diffusion are passively transport meaning they go with the concentration gradient and use no energy3 active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient an example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis
one way cells move is using a flagella  it is a talelike structure  another way cells move is using cilla  these are hairlike structures on the outside of the cell  the last way is the psudopod or false foot  the cell sends out a part of itself and the rest follows
cell diffusion keep some cells form moving out of the membrane
the stimulas keeps the proteins and organalles in place so that the membrane dose not let proteins move freely trough it
the three process that can be used are in meiosis which would be prophase interphase and telophase metphase would not be used in this
1they use long whipped like structures to move around2the cells go and kill the bad things that dont need to be in our body 3the cells go from place to place multiplying themselves and helping our body
a cell consist of many parts to protect things from getting in one part is the cell membrane the cell membrane acts like an outer lining to protect the cell from harmful things getting in the mitocodria is another part it carries out waste from the cell the final part is the cell wall found only in plants this allowes a double protection feature to be sure things dont get in

the cell membrane regulates movement in and out of the cell by monitoring what passes through  in prokaryotic cells an operon consisting of switch and area to latch onto regulates the transcription of dna  in eukaryotic cells cell regulation can be monitored by the removal of introns
mitosismeiosiscell reproduction
cells use diffusion osmosis and facilitated diffusion to move susbstances across the membrane  diffusion and osmosis are types of passive transport  diffusion is used to regulate substances with the outside environment using the cell membrane while osmosis transports water and other liquids through the membrane  on the other hand facilitated diffusion is a type of active transport  it is also a type of diffusion albeit it uses energy to transport the substances out of the cell
passive transport is when the substance can move freely through the cell membrane
osmosis diffusion
sodiumpotassium pump  needs to be an exchange of sodium and potassium for a door to open and a substance comes inthe cell could engulf the substance

1 they allow what they want to enter the cell2 they allow what they dont want to exit the cell3 they dont just let anything leave
osmosis this is where the cell lets water penatrate through membrane
the cell membrane of the cell can help it move the nucleus of the cell can determine wether the cell can move
the cell membrane determines what can enter the cell and what can not lysosomes act ike janitors for the cells and remove waste the cell membrane is made up of proteins and carbohydrates
they can use atp the takes energy to move them from place to place cells also use marker proteins so other cells can read where they are needed to do a job
selective permeable membrane restricts what goes through the cell membrane osmosis also is a selective membrane which helps the nutrients needed go through the cells membrane
flagella it is used to move the cell and how fast it is moving large hairlike cilia it is used to move the cell slower small hairlikesome cells use thier bodies to move and they move slow
one is called the cilia cilia are little hair like structures that help the cell or organsim move and protect it and another is a gel like substance that is sticky and slimmy it is what the snails use so they can move it is a thick layer off slim that helps move and protect it
though a small opening that only aloows certain thing to come in the fact there is no cell wall pushing and using enegry to get though the cell membrane

1 a permeable membrane chooses what objects enter and leave the cell2 active transport helps larger objects pass through this permeable membrane3 passive transport also helps other objects move from inside the cell or out
osmosis is when water is used to move around the cell membrane
the three mitocondria amino acids and dna
anaphaseprophasetelophase
one process is the cell wall because that is the outer covering of the cell so it doesnt let anything out of it  the second process is the ribosomes because it cannot go past the cell membrane  the third process is cell membrane itself because it also protects everything and doesnt let anything past the it so it dont touch the cell wall

the membrane is selectively permeable  it only allows things through that it recognizes  some things have special entrances to the cell
transcription
cells use vesicles transport chains and protiens to control the movement of subsatnces across the cell membrane vesicles eat and digest unwanted or wasted substances when the vesicle dies so does the celltransport chains carry many things across the cell this way equilibrium is reached rna can leave the cell and many other things can occur to keep the cell goingprotions act as gates for subatances entering and leaving the cell they open and have the particles attatch to them they then close and open up on the opposite side this way things that should not go into the cell are not let in or out
osmosis is when water comes through the cell membrane  other times the cell opens its membrane and allows a substance to enter  the last type is when a substance exits the membrane may open up to allow the object out
three processes cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are using lipids to pass on materials meiosis and mitosis
1 when an emzyne csuch as insulin attaches to a cell it tells the cell to let in sugar2 equalibrum is when one side has more of a protien then the other so they transfer the protiens over untill they are equal3when a protien fits into a channel protien to make it change shape for a bigger protien to come through
cells use selective permiability to control substance movement the plasma membrane is semipermiable it allows water in and out without trouble however it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell the plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance substances enter the cell through carrier proteins these proteins are surrounded by polar heads and nonfatty acid tails this membrane is water soluable the carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient

three movements are flushing out bursting vacoules and breakdown of the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion osmosis and endocytosis diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration the goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium and have everything balanced osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane however endocytosis is a form of active transport endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules such a food into the cell this takes more energy from the cell and may use enzymes to quicken the process

one of the processes is diffusion the second one is
active transport active transport is when a cell uses energy to transport substances across the cell membranepassive transport passive transport is when a cell transports materials across the cell membrane without the use of energyosmosis osmosis is the transport of substances through the semipermeable membrane water
they swim across they wiggle they crawl
one of these ways is by the cell membrane this organelle moves and allowes acces for food for the cell  the other one is cloralplast this is a jell like thing in side the cell and it moves material through out the cell after the substance moves through the cell membrane
three prcesses used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are defication ribosomes and cell pores
diffusion is when small particles cross over the membrane from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration it does not require energy but is a way to keep the environment in which the cell is in balancedosmosis is the diffusion of water particles through the cell membrane it is also relative to the environment and will move from an area of high concentration of water particles to an area of low concentration of water particlesfacilitated diffusion is when the cell has to use energy to pass particles through the membrane it is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration

one of the processes is through cell diffusion the second type is through the process of osmosis which pulls water through the cell the third type is mitosis
the to enter the cell you have to use atp energy
three processes used by cells are diffusion which is the movement of molecules over a selectively permeable membrane osmosis which involves water being passed over the membrane and active diffusion which requires energy from the cell to move particles through the membrane
one process used by cells is endocytosis  in endocytosis the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle  this vesicle can now travel into the cell  also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell  a vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane  another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels  the directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached
the cell wall desides what comes in and out of the cell throught its small holes that help make up the cell wallthe holes in the wall help suck in the nutrients that the cell needsthe holes also help remove waste from the cell membrane
cells use processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane these processes are respiration cell division and also reproduction
one of them is that the cell membrane is selectivley permeable the cell membrane controlls what enters and exits the cell  the nucleus tells the cell what to do because it acts as a brain
cells can control which amino acid strains pass through the membrane as directed by the nucleus of that cell
osmosis is the movement of water between the cell membranesdiffusionmovement of other materials through the cell membrane
difffusion osmosis and protein carriers
they controll the movement if substance across the cell membrane by helping to figure out what goes in and what comes out
translocation protein
homeostasis     respiration system
three processes used by cells to control the movement across a cell membrane are osmosis diffusion and active transport
carry information provide nutrients
cells use active transport to get anything that is bigger than a protein through the membrane this requires energy cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane the last process that cells use is called osmosis and that is used to get water across the membrane neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy
the cell membrane has three processes to control the movement of substances one being that it protects the cell allowing only what it wants to enter and exit
osmosis the movement of water from one place to another diffusion the movement of materials from one place to another
cells use diffusion to move subtstances across the membrane and obtain equilibrium
a cell uses diffusion osmosis and transportation in diffusion substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane there are two types of transport active and passive active transport uses energy from the cell to move over the cell membrane while passive transport uses heat
cells use diffition the a transport that does not use energy  cells use passisve transport where a sudstance comes into a cell  cells use active transport which a cell uses energy to grab a substance
one way is by using cilia to move substances across the membrane with small hairlike apendages another way is to use flagella long whiplike apendages used to move substances across the cell membrane one more way to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is by releasing ribosomes

some cells use the cell wall as a barrier to allow or block certain sustances from coming in  other particles may be too large to come through by themselves so other cells will absorb them and carry them through  other cells may use osmosis as a means of transporting or disposing of certain sustances
mrna carries out messages throughout the celltrna transfers energies throughout the cellrrna reproduces
one part opens and kinda suck it in and another part filters to keep the bad thing out and then the first part which is the cell membrane closes back up
the holes in a cell membrane let proteins and other good or bad things that cells need into and out of the cell by opening and closingthe nucleous tells the cell membrane when and when not to open its holes up to let things in and out
cells change prokaryotesprotects nucleuscirculates other cells
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is type of phase their on the protein that tells when to replicate
one process that a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is the surface area if the surface area is too large the cell wont let any more substances move throughout the cell membrane another way is facilitated diffusion this controls the amount of substances that are allowed to enter the cell
diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside  this process does not require any energyactive transport is the movement of substance from a low concentration to a high one  this does require energyosmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane  the cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell
there is active transport passive transport and something else
the cell can use passive transport which allows things to freely move in and out of the cell given the concentration of the matter active transport uses energy from the cell to move materials against the gradient one form of this moves materials out called endosymbiosis another form moves them inside the cell called exosymbiosis

1 exocytosis a process by which materials are moved out of a cell2 endocytosis a process by which materials are moved into a cell3 solute pump where materials are moved into or out of a cell by a two way pump that runs off of an enzyme it is a passive transport and an example is a sodiumpotassium pump
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are reproduction producing more organisms movement moving from place to place and photosynthesis if the organism is photosynthetic to make food
diffusion and osmosis are two types of movement of substances across a cell membrane diffusion is used to diffuse outwards osmosis is used to slide over the membrane
the cell
1diffusion when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area2 facilitated diffusion when molecules cant move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3 osmosis the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
the nuclius is the brain of the cell that controls everything  the vacuol takes all unessisary wast and bacteria out of the cell the mitocondrian surve to maximize cellular reperation by increasing cellular communication
metosis interphase and prophase
passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell active transport is the use of energy to move a protien across the cell membrain carrier protiens use a certin type of chemical make up to control what goes into a cell a transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain
osmosis is when water on each side of the membrane reaches an equalibriumdiffusion is when any substance reaches an equilibrium across a semipermiable membranefacilitated diffusion is when the substance is moved from the low concentration side of  the membrane to the highly concentrated side of the membrane
1 phagocytosis it traps certain materials and allows them to enter the cell2 exocytosis pushes certain materials out of the cell3 entrocytosis allows certain things into the cell

one would be by using the flagelum beause it helps to give movement
one would be the cell wall another would be the nucleus membrain and the last one would be the nucleus
there is osmosis homeostasis and diffusion across a cell memebrane homeostasis helps control the temperature of the cells by knowing how much fluid needs to be in a cell osmosis is the process of how much fluid or water is needed inside of a cell diffusion across a cell membrane is where it only lets in certain chemicals that the body needs it lets out the water and other fluid inside a cell
the er  the nucleus and the cytoplasm
three processes that control the movement across a cell membrane is the sugar ribose and a phosphate
one thing they do is keep certain things that the cell wants in or out this is done by a gate like strycture on the surface od the membrane this mainly allows almost all things to get in and certain things to get out
the three process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are glycolysis osmosis and diffusion  glycolysis is anaerobic meaning that it does not require oxygen  osmosis is the taking in and removing wastes or materials from the cell  diffusion is the movement of water across a cell may have to deal with a hypertonic or hypotonic solution
active transport passive transport and
cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane the substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradientcells use active transport also during active transport energy input is needed from atp to move a substance against its concentration gradientcells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell in exocytosis vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell in endocytosis the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material
firstly there are only so many entrances through the cell membrane that food or other things can enter through secondly if the cell get to much food or other things inside of it it will close these holes thirdly there are organisms inside and outside the cell that control the flow of food

passive transport is to help the cells to move throughout the cells active transport is the transport that is always active and moving sugars are one of the transports to
1 cells use cilla2 cells use a flagellum3 cells move in the bloostream
endocytosis the cell uses energy to envelop an outside object into the cellexocytosis the cell uses energy to envolop an inside object in order to get it out of the cellosmosis water goes through the cell membrane without using energy
plasma membrane jellylike fluid that keeps the parts of the cell in placecell wall holds all these parts in the cell and protects the parts inside such as the nucleus keeps foreign organisms out of the cell
they move around the cells membrane and comunicate by signaling each other and also by comunicating with one another in oter ways they all have a funtion or job to do when in the cell membrane
three processes used by cells to control the movement are the cell membrane the cell wall and the cell nucleous
separate  passagescertain jobs
active transportwhich is where energy is envovledthere is cellular respirationwhich is the oxygen flow
transpotation divises
cells carry them to the places they need to beas the cell goes across the membrane as the substance is being used the substance would be used up again after the first time
cell growth cell division replication
the golgi apparatus acts as a transportation system of protiens in a cell by importing and exporting the proteins the ribosomes are protein builders in the cell and the endoplasmic reticulum controls what proteins the cell keeps
endocytosis into cell exocytosis out of cellosomosis diffusion of water out of the permeable membrane
the cell uses osmosis and facilitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane
one process is that the cells use their functions to move substances two is that differnet organelles help the cells move the substances and the third is that the cells guide the substances to their destination
movement
mitosis
control the membrane control its movements
the cell membrane determines what go into the cell and what leaves the cell
they carry itwiggle it accrostglide it
the carbon chains on the end of proteins on the outside of the membrane filters what goes in and out of the cell proteins on the inside of the membrane block out some of the things that may find a way through transprort proteins finaly there are proteins on the inside of the cell which can stop anything from getting into the cell
the cell has a seletively permeable membrane and uses osmosis and reverse osmosis to move material across the cell membrane
the process is called energy transport chain
1 mitochondrian carry energy                2 flagella makes sure everything moves properly in the cell
osmosis can be used to diffuse water accross a membranean active transport can be used to move objects against the consentration gradient protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this it takes more energy than a passive transporta passive transport uses a consentration gradient to move substances accross the membrane a passive transport uses little or no energy
one process that the cell uses to control movment of substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis another procces is faciliated diffusion the last process of movement of substances across the cell membrane is diffusion
the cell has a cell wall the controls what comes in and what comes out of the cell there are holes on the cell wall that only certain things that the cell needs and wants to get rid of
the permiable membrane only takes in food and energy that is need it also discards the already used substances in the cell it also regulates osmosis
cell wall it can allow things to enter or leave  so it can control how the movement across the cell membranecells move causing the movement also to be determinedhow healthy the cell is
the lipid bylear acts as a wall to block out unwanted particles and if it wants something to leave or enter it will make things like pockets and allow the particles to enter the pocket and it will close itself and allow the particle to leave the cell also uses osmosis to allow the water to go through the cell
anaphaseinterphasemetaphase
dynamic equilibrium the cell membrane keeps the same amout of substances in a cell as there is outdiffusion the movement of water across the cell membranesemipermeable membrane allows some substanes to enter and others to not enter the cell
the first is osmosis where a liquid moves through the cell membrane by the process of diffusion  another process the cells use is that a certain substance may only enter the cell if it has the correct protein sequence  the last process is that a substance isnt able to move across the cell membrane if it would be harmful to the cell so the cell membranes function is to keep these substances from getting into the cell

they use nuclear envelope which is the processing center of the cell ribosomes which are around cell membrane and chromosomes that are around the cell membrane too
meosis metaphase and rna
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis and meiosis
the cell uses the chloroplast to move things quickly and efficently  they also use the cell wall to keep things in so they cant loose anything  the membrane tells everything where it needs to be and where to go
1 waste removal waste is removed from the cell2 reproduction if the cell gets to many materials it gets to big to function properly so it splits into two living organisms3 spongelike surface selectively lets things in and out of the cell

the processes used by cells to control the movement of a substances across the cell membrane is movementrespirationreproduction
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are sodiumpotassium pumps endocytosis and exocytosis sodiumpotassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane endocytosis is a process in which a group of phospholipids surrounds a substance outside of the cell in a circle and carries it in to the cell exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead
one process used by cells to control the movement of a substance is that the nucleous an other way the cell controls movement is when the ribosomes carry information from one  thing in a cell to another lastly is when the rna and dna make up sequences telling what should happen in  the movement of the cell
the three processes used by cells are receiving nutrients throwing away their wastes and carring out information to other cells

the plasma membrane helps control what crosses the cell membrane the nuclear membrane controls what crosses the cell membrane diffusion helps control how much fluid crosses the cell membrane osmosis helps control what substances cross the cell membrane
diffusion selective permiabilty and osmosis
they have a cell wall which protects anything from getting in and anything going out  they have organelles to break down proteins and get the waste out of cells  cells also have mitochondria that increase its surface area to add more respiration to the cell
flagella flagella are long  whiplike structures that help them move across an areacilia cilia are hairlike structures that allow the cell to move aroundslime slime helps snails slide across areas
molecules stop certain substances from getting accross but sometimes the substances can sneak in when another substance in going in
they are what makes everything happen in our body
the three movements are anaophase telophase and peolphase
osmosismitosismeosis

the three processes used by the cell are the making of proteinsthe packing processand the moving of the proteins out
osmosis is movement of water across a selectively permiable membranediffusion requires none of the cells energy to move substances through the cells membraneactive transport requires the cells energy to move substances through the cells membrane by using things such as protein channels
passive  goes in and out the cell without using energy
the cell has a permeated membrane that allows certain things in and keeps certain things out this also allows the cell to get rid of waste

cells use various types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane  osmosis is the process in which water is transfered between cells of diffrent types  cell membrane also detects which kind of materials allow to enter the cells and it will only allow it pass if it has a certain protein coating
one way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through active transport active trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane passive transport also moves substances out of the membrane but it does not require energy diffusion is another way of transporting substances
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane are the cytoplasm slowing the substances and acting like a jello to control the movement endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus
process one nuclear envelope and pores allow things to travel in and out of the nucleus process two cell membrane protects the cell and also decides what can go in and out of the cellprocess three osmosis

the process that is used to move substances from one side of the cell membrane to the other is diffusion  diffusion is the movement of solid substances across the cell membrane  another one is called osmosis and that is when liquid substances are moved acorss the membrane from higher concentration to lower concentration areas
moving from the golgi bodies to the cell wall by visicles is one way taking ribosomes from the rough er to the golgi bodies is another mitosis could be another way of movement
first it enters from the contractile vacoule and moves across the cell through the cytoplasm  it enters out of the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum to remove waste
diffusion where materials move on water across the membrane selective permeabilitywhere certain things can leave or enter the cell and
plasma membrand   nuclusmillia
the first processe is rna
they can use trna they can send out blood cells to slow it down they can also send out white blood cells
the cell chooses what can move across the cell membrane by the chemical or by the size of the substance
they move from one structure in the organism to another
active transportthis is the transport of something when energy is neededpassive transportthis is the transport of something without using energydiffusionthis is the natural movement of a higher concntration to a lower concentration

air water nerves
one process is osmosis which controls how much water comes in and out of the cell endocytosis and exocytosis are used to control the what substances enter and leave through the plasma membrane facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell selective permeability is a process that allows certain things in the cell and keeps certain things out
1 osmosis particles move through the cell membrane if there is an unequal concentration of the substance on each side of the cell membrane2 proteins a cell could call some protiens to move particles from outside of the cell inside the cell or vice versa the proteins would sit on the membrane and shoot particles through3 phagocytosis a cell will eat another cell
respiration what cells use to livereproduction devolopement of new celltranslocation moved to different place about the cell
some cells use tale like structurs called fegilia to move others use use cilia or slide
diffusion is the movement of low concentration to high concentration in the cell membrane osmosis is the movement of water going from a low concentration to a high concentration in the cell membrane
the cell moves its way to the cell membrane by fighting off the fungus  then it goes through the stages then gets to the cell membrane
the cell stretches its body to move 
1the substances travel through the membrane in a normal fashion throught the pathways2the membrane envelopes the substance and pulls it into the cell
the cell membrane is permeable and allows substances to enter and leave the cell
one proccess used by cells is diffusion were the food is slowly allowed to pass through the membrane another proccess is when a food particle is surrounded until it is taken into the cell

anaphaseprophasetelophase
it uses small hair like structures to move around they move back and forth across the membrane to move then the substance can be moved any where on the cell
one process a cell uses is called osmosis osmosis helps the water transport all throughout the cell and on a permeable membraneanother process a cell uses is called active transport because substances in the cell are being transported through the membrane to the different organellesthe other process that a cell uses is called oxygen diffusion the oxygen is being moved around the cells to keep the body from not functioning right it also makes it able for the cells to stay alive and not die off
osmosis is when water is passing through the cell active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane passive transport is whe a substance does not require the use of energy to be moved out of the cell
first there is the cell wall in plant cells that block unwanted things from entering the cell they are there to protect the cell from getting bad things in it like a virus or bacterium or just usless things  in the cell membrane there is a hole for things like rna to pass through things still need to enter the cell for the cell to do its job whatever that may be
cells can osmosis which is the process of which water passes accross a cell membrane the cell membrane also has small gaps which limit the things that go into the cell if something to large attempts to go in it will get stuck
the mitocondria help keep dead cells off the cell membrane golgi apparatus helps keep the substances moving
isotonic where there is the same amount of a substance in and outside the cell so the volumes are the samehypertonic where that amout of a sunstance is greater on the outside of a cell so it moves in through the semipermiable membraneosmosis where a substance moves in and out of the cell
the first process that cells use is diffusion cells have membranes that control what makes it into the cell and what cannot get inside the cell the second process cells use are tunnellike objects certain tunnels only can carry certain substances across the membrane and into the cell such as a tunnel only being used for carbon the third process cells use is called osmosis osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane water is a very simple and easy to carry molecule so it easily diffuses unless there is a balance of water on the inside and outside of the cellequilibrium
the cells use the cell membrane to control what comes in and out of the cellbecause if anything harmful comes in the cell it could damage the newly made cellsand if those get damaged then the cells will not be made or funtion properly
three  processes include mrna trna and rrna
the cell wall keeps everything inside the cell the vacuole takes out any unhealthy stuff the mitochondria keeps everything moving and aligned
homostasis
diffusion this distibutes molecules evenlyosmosis water distributing evenly active transport the cell itself using energy to move materials
passive transport doesnt require energyactive transportrequires energy
one process used by cells to control the movement of substances is mitosis which splits the cells another process is miosis which splits the cells again and the third process used by cells is mutation
cells have receptors on their outside that are in the phospholipid bilayer that only allow substances in if they match up to the receptors perfectly cells also use a process in which they form a bubble around a substance endocytosis that they want to bring into the cell this uses atp another process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the membrane is exocytosis which is when the cell gets rid of substances by forming a bubble around the substance and sending it out of the cell this is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal
the use of rna  mrna     and singnals let iff by dna
one way would be be active transport another way would be by
cells use the membrane to move transporter proteins in and out also marker proteins

1 whip like tail helps move it along2 fins helps it swimor3 flexible body moves by itself
osmosis  allows water to pass through the cell membranediffusion  allows substances to pass through membranesrna  trasfers information through cell membranes
the nucleus controls what moves in and out of the membraneif harmful substances are entering then cells will decrease yet they will reproduce at the same rate
movement reproduction transportation
first would be that the cell membrane would squish in different direction to allow substances to cause no harm second would be that maybe the membrane would do the exact opisite and would resist any impact last the membrane might be to move the membrane around to make substances roll off the membrane
air water oxygen     one process of movement across a cell membrane would be from air getting under the substance in the cell  the next process of movement would be liquids getting under the substance and carrying it across the cell  last it would be by oxygen this oxygen also gets underneath the substance and carries it across the cell
it moves by the force of the enxymes across the cell membrane
they wiggle they have a tail and they have a something else
they use different types of systems depending on the proccess that the cell needs done

one type of movement acrossed the membrane is osmosis osmosis is when the substance uses water to move across the membrane another processes is active transport active transport is the processes of moving acrossed the membrane by the membrane being selectivly permeable the last processes is difussion diffusion is when the cells  diffuse so that they can move across the selectivly permeable membrane
they get rid of nutrients they dont needthey use different cells to do certain jobs
the cell uses it organells and cell wall and membrane to controll what gos in and comes out
three processed used by cells to control the movement of subtances across the cell are called the cilia flagnelle and the something else
the ribosomes decide what enters and leaves the cell the nucleus lets the waste exit the cell membrane and the mitochondria decides at times what can enter
the endoplasmic reticulum helps proteins travel through the cell  transcription and translation also take place in the cell
one process is habitat locationsecond process is homeostasisthird process is geographical isolation

in diffusion the surface of the cell decised what substances go in and out of the cell in mitosis the things inside the cell are used to move and function in the cellin meiosis sustances pass throught the wall of the cell and do tings that help the cell do things
they control osmosis and diffusion this is the movement of water across the membrane  they also allow children to be made  they are copied form the parents and travel across the membranes they also attack sickness in the body especially at open wounds
copy copy over genetic informationcrossing over the cell then cross to the membranedivide the cell then divdes into 2 sections and replicates
endo plasmic rectualum the outter wasll of a cell
the use their cytoplasm to controll where things movethey use there cell walls to keep unwanted organisms outthey use tunnels to let the wanted organisms to get in
osmosis the absorbtion of substances into the cellfacillitated diffusinmitosis
the cell has osmosis which means the substances move through the membrane surface not across it also has diffusion which is how it moves things across the surface of the membrane it also has another thing but i cant remember it
there is the cell membrane the cell wall and the membrane bound organelles
osmosis transfers water and liquid across the cell membrane
carry
1 the cell membrane has tiny pores in them so the pores could block out certain substances that might not fit through 2 the cell could move to a certain location to get away from the particular substance being produced in its current area3 the cells pores have a gateway to them that could allow certain substances to get in and others to stay out
cell membrain cell wall potothenisis
there are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane one of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in with treh cell membrane moving around it therefore positioning it inside treh cell another way is that treh cell opens up when treh substance or substances come in contact and then closing after it reaches across treh cell membrane another way is that treh cell would move to it and then absorbs it in a way of speech
the dna cant leve the nuculeos so it has the rna come in the nuculeos and git the protean and leves the nucleos to transport the protean
the cell wall blocksproteins will carrythe transfer of chemical make up or dna
they use the flagellum to move
the cell membrane lets substances in an out of the cellthe mitochondria ships things that are need outthe golgi apperatus also removes unwanted things
endocytosis is the movement of substances into the cell exocytosis is the movement of substances out of the cell diffusion is the movement of substances from an area of high concentrain to an area of low concentration
the nuclear envelope which controls what goes through the cellthe cell membrane controls what leaves the cellthe vacuole which stores food and water for the cell
cell respirationcell divisoncytokinesis
diffusion is a high concentration to a low concentration osmosis is diffusion only it is with water facilitated diffusion is diffusion only with large molecules
diffusion is when the particles pass through the membrane osmosis is when water carries the particles in through the membrane facilated diffusion is when particles are attatched to something else that is going into the membrane

1 there is active transport to where the cell is allowed into the cell or not the active transport allows only certain type of organisms to enter or leave the cell2 diffusion is another way cells get in and out of the cells is where the cell depending on its size  will determine whether or not that it is able to move throughout the cell3 the other one is where the nuclear envolope sends a messeges and tells the membrane what to do from there
one proses is called cell movement that is where the cell is moved thrue the cell by the organells
the rough er golgi membrane in the mitichondria
the three process that are used to control the movement of substances cross the cell membrane is
one is the mitocondria which controls what goes in and out of the cell second is the vacole which is the stomach of the cell last is the membrane which is the control center of the cell
cells use three different methods to control movement of foreign substances one for example would be diffusion it controls the water that moves in and out of a cell another example would have to be that the cell wall uses methods to control what comes in and out they have many specialized glandsopenings that allow specific things to enter and leave the cell
trna transports the cell to the mrna which absorbs the cell which takes it to the rna which is the transformed into dna
ribosomes transport substancestrna read themrrna tells them where to go
1 flagella long whip like and helps the cell move the cell only has one                         2 silla little hair like and helps the cell move many are on the cells     3 i do not know
diffusion is the movement of water across the cell membranecell wall keeps things in and out of the cell membranethe selective membrane lets the good things in and keep the bad things out
one decription of a way the cell controls movement is by its cell wall the cell wall protects and sheilds the cell     another decription of a way the cell controls movement is by the nucleus the nucleus keeps the cell functioining     lastly another way the cell controls movement is by ribosomes
three processes a cell uses to move particles through the cell membrane are through the carrier portein pump protein and the tunnel protein
the cellia it has little tails that make a cell move the water vain that go to the membran of the cell and the memebran that controls the every thing to make the cell move
there are three different types of proteins used to transport  substances across the cell membrane  these three proteins are transport receptor and glycoproteins  transport proteins transport things directly through the cell membrane as long as they fit  receptor proteins check to see if the thing attemtping to pass through are good for the body or not and let them through accordingly  glycoproteins only open for certain substances to be passed through the cell membrane
protein synthesis and cell division
pores control the movementwhen potassuim goes back and forth across cellsand when wastes are extracted from cells
actice transportpassice transportfacilitative diffusion
the cell membrane allows the material to get into the cell and materail from the cell to move out the sugars go to the protein and forms the cells protective layer then the enzymes go through the gateway type of process which allows enzymes to switch from one side to the other of the cell membrane then the cell membrane lets material go out of the cell and inside of the cell
osmosis  water passing through the cell membranecell respiration  cell eating drinking and breathing through its membranecannot remember third go celtics
cells process things coming in and out of the call membrane calls also
mitochondia moves stuff lysosomes move things and chlorophyll moves items
the movement acrosss the cell membrane is controlled by the type of cell the membrane and the flagella
osmosis water moves through the cell membranediffusion water diffuses through the membraneabsorbition
diffusion allows materials to pass in and out of a selectively permiable membrane through the pores in the cell membraneosmosis allows water to pass through a cell membrane through the pores in the cell membranefacilitated diffusion the movement of matter through a non selectively permiable membrane
osmosisactive difffusionpassive diffusion
anaphase metaphase prophase
the have a cell wall which prevents things from entering the cell and it also provides support to the cell
3 processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are ion channels which use a channel protein to move things in and out of the cells diffusion which is moving a substance from a high concentration to low concentration and hypotonic diffusion which taking in substances
osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane diffusion is another movement of substances across the membrade of the cell bionary fusion is another process where the cell membrane opens up to let a substance in that is too big to go in the cell membrane alone
carrier protiens move them through the cells membrane by opening like a gate flagella whip substances across the surface of the cell pores open to allow small enough substances to pass through the membrane
miosis
they guide it
a cell membrane is whem the cell are attack the membrane for the cell to move thought the membrane and how it is the number one why for the cell membrane to be attack for the cell to get out
their is active transport passive transport and then their is gradient transport active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell passive transport is where subtances pass through the memebrane with out the cell using energy to bring subtances
here are three processes used by cells to control movement a dog and a cat and a human
the cell membrane is used to control the movement of substances across a cell the cell membrane may block out harmful substances and the cell membrane will also let substances needed for the process into the cell the cell membrane is very permable
the cell uses the cell wall and the cell membrane to help it move substances through the cell  these help regulate what gets into the cell and what doesnt  once inside the cell the nucleus will decide what is done with those substances
cells use diffusion to let substances permiate its membranecells use facilitaded diffusion or use energy to help the substance pass through its membranecells use passive diffusion or dont use energy to help the substance pass through its membrane
three types of movement that cells use to move substances acrossed the membrane are one is osomis osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane diffusion is also one during diffusion a substance moves from high to low concertration
the cells have three different processes one is that the cell helps control movement of things in the cell another one is that the cell has cytoplasm that holds all the things together in the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement  of a cell is mitchodria cyplast and cell wall
cells can transfer substances make more or give substances
diffusion is the process cells use to move liquid materials inside and out of the sell by passing through the cell membrane respiration is the process cells use to move needed to take in the materials needed to survive and output materials used by other organisms excretion is the process used by cells to remove waste products and unnecessary nutrients
one process is through absorbing the substance into the cell another process would be by certain parts of the membrane haveing different roles to fill by having a certain hole in their area this lets larger objects get through the membrane easily and effectively
flagellun cell membrane cell
one way would be that the plasma membrane controls what comes in and out of the cell another way would be from osmosis also a way would be through diffusion
reproduction is produsing mre offsprings
the cell membrane use the receptors of the cell to send out messages of needs to be done the processes are to find out what needs to be done fix it and make sure that what was sent out is what was received
there are several processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane three processes are exocytosis endocytosis and phagocytosis
the cell wall protectsthe cell from substances coming in or going out of the cell
selective permiability selects what substances get in and out of the cellactive transport which requires movement and creates  an opening for substances to movepassive transport doesnt require movement of cells to move substances
blood flow
cells have a selective membrane which only allow certain things to enter and leave the cell it controls for example how much water leaves and enters the cell cells also use proteins as means to transport things through the cell to other cells
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion osmosis and active transport  diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane  the water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration  active transport is the opposite of diffusion  in active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration
1 the cell wraps it items in fat
1 osmosis slow spreading out equally of substances in a cell2
the interphase anaphase and telaphase
osmosis the movement of water defusion the movement of objectsactive tranportation the movement of organeals
the three processes used be cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport photosynthesis and hyperactive transport
difffusion or the spontaneous movement of a substance from a high concentration to a low concentration zonefacilitated diffusion or when diffusion occurs through special protein channels located in the cell membraneactive transport meaning that the cell invests atp in order to transport substances in or out of the cell up the concentration gradient by special protein pumps
the three processes that the cells use to control movement across the cell membrane are the cell wall mitosis and osmosis
first thing would be there round small shape helps them flow all around the bodysecond thing would be the mebrane inside the cell it can give enrgy to help it move and livetherd thing is the function it has in the body only so that the body notice what it is and it allows it to get to where it needs to go
1 oxygen diffusion2homestasis3protein synthesis
there is a protien requires energy water can pass through plasma membrane easily
the cells can control the movement of substances across the membrane by slowing them down and blocking out certain substances they might allow certain substances to come in but others cannot
they use their flagellum to move aroundthey move their bodies to move like a snakethey use the hairlike structures on their bodies
organelle flagelton and the nucleius
they have cell walls so things dont go threw to the nucleus as easythey nucleus is in the center so it controls everything
there is active transport which helps with the flow of water molecules into the cellthere is passive transport which helps bring protiens into the cellthere protien transport which helps bring in enzymes into the cell
1how big the openings are in the membrane      2what type of cells are allowed threw the openings

crossing over mutations cellular respiration
the cytoplasm flagullum and the shape of the substances
cells can use their cell wall to control movement of substances by not letting the substances into the cell
well there is the process of the nucleus saying hey i need more of this and send it up to the brain  then the trna goes out and deleviers the message to where ever it needs to go  when the message gets to where it needs to be then that thing makes it and then it gets transfered to the brian since that is where it is need
the cell uses ribosomes to move substances across the cell membrane
to transfer rna
the mitocodriagogi apperatus nucleus
golgi apparatus
destroy it posin it change it
translation transcription and trna
active transport is one of the three in active transport the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane this energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell the next process is passive transport in passive transport the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell this is because the concentration is much higher within the cell the final process is osmosis which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing heat or friction
1 kreb cycle when they move carban and oxygen around to make atp2 calvin cycle when they use oxygen to make a little atp3 active transport that moves the cells around to make atp
cellular respiration it releases oxygen keeping the substances from movingphotosynthesis it uses atp to create glucosethe cell wall protects the substances from moving any further
osmosis which lets water in and out of the cell diffusion which lets small proteins in and outfacilated diffusion which lets larger proteins in and out
the cell uses cilla no move around to get food the cell also ueses things golgi apperates to move things out of the cell
the cell gets rid of wastethe cell lets some substences insidethe cell makes some substances
osmosis diffusion crossing over of moving particles
well the mitchondria which pretty much is the main power source of the cell it keeps everything in check all the cells have differnt jobs to do in the body the cell membrane makes sure that the stuff the cell needs it makes sure it gets it
cells occuring throughout in the cell memebrane
plasmembreane to movemovement to move around the cellplacement to place something in the cell
mitosis they seperate to make it easier to pass things through the cell they are selectively permeable which alows them to chose what gets in and out of the cell
control the brainmove where they need to becontrol the membrain
one
osmosis  movement of water across selectively permeable cell membranediffusion  molecules freely move across cell membrane until both sides have equilibruim transfer proteins move molecules out of the cell when there are too many
the cell membrane will only allow certain things to pass through the cell membrane is jelly like so if it bumps into another cel there is no damage the cell membrane doesnt allow carbon into it
endocytosis cell membrane envelopes material and is absorbed into the celldiffusion concentration gradient is higher outside the cell causing the material to naturally diffuse across the membranefacilitated diffusion carrier proteins help materials move with the concentration gradient through the cell membrane
exocytosis is one process in which cell control movement across the cell membranes in which it exits substances out of the cellendocytosis is the process in which the susbstances move from outside the cell into the cell membrane and inside the cellisotope is the process in which the substances come and go  equal in and  out the cell but in a balanced way
1pores2fighting3mutation
1 diffusion2 active transport3 passive transport
the three processes used by the cell to control the movement if the substances across the cell membrane are the brain of the cell the motion of the cell and the way that they take care of them selves

photosynthesis is the division of cells mytosis meiosis
interphase metaphase and anaphase
the cell controls the movement of substances around the membrane by controling it
the cell membrane will act like a body guard and say weather or not an object or organism can make its way into the cell  the cell may use asmosis to tranfer material across the cell  the nucleus is the brains of the cell and it will tell if something is supposed to be there or not
cells use diffusion and osmoisis to move substances across the cell membrane diffusion is substances moving from an area with more mass to an area with less mass osmoisis is the movement of water through the cell membrane a cell membrane also has pores that particles can enter and exit from
one process is diffussion diffusion is whenever substances diffuse over the cells membrane another process is the fission where the substances go through a hole in the membrane
one movement in the cell is the rna another thing that moves cells is energy  another is passive transportation
they grow legs and run away
the cell does through movements to control the cell membrane is the cell wall it control what enters and leaves they cellflegall helps the cell move
they can use their cilia flagella or they could not move at all
cells have semipermeable membranes which allow particles to pass through cell walls others have permeable membranes which allow particle to move freely through the cells walls and other cell walls are not permeable at all allowing nothing to pass through
the ribosomes produce the energy for the cellthe golgi appartatus gets rid of waste and the nucleus hold all the information and dna
1 in through cell wall2 out of nucleus3 out through cell wall
osmosis controlls how much water can be inside the cell the cell has a cell memberane that only lets certain things into and out of the cell there are tiny little holes in the memberane that can only fit certain sized things into the cell so if the thing that is trying to get into the cell is too big then it will not be able to get into the cell
cellular respiration ion channle lipid bilayer
the three types are diffusion facilitated diffusion and active transport diffusion doesnt use energy to move substances the movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium or is the equal the substance will move back and forth equallya specific type of diffusion is osmosis the diffusion of water facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane it uses no energy because it still diffusion it uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration this type of transportation does use energy because it goes against the flow it is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste
the cell is connected to the membrane and by chanelling the membrane it tells it to move protins also send messages to the cell to tell it to move the cell and cells are linked and communicating all the time
they processes by cells central movement they can move by a roddili spiralthey can process or control their movement by flagella
a cell controls the movement so it can contrarn the so it can get dan to the place it needs it
flaggelum is used to move also in mrna
1they use sodiumpotassium pumps to move sodium and potassium in and out    2they use vacules to ingulf food through phagocytosis3 they use markers to deside if the substance is ok to travel into the cell
the cells use the cell wall to limit movement across the cellalso uses energy
the cells travel to the rna and sends a message to the mrna

osmosis diffusion and active transport
osmosis
they use osmosis they use a barrier around them so nothing can cross
1 direction2 movement3 and reason
the cell membrane is the cell structure in which any subtance moves across because it is the outer part of the cell and allows anything to pass on top of itthe cytoplasm that is on the cell membrane is a very helpful factor to help things move across the membraneall cells have a special ability to move across the cell membrane they have a flagellum that is a taillike structure that enables the cell to move
flagella is one of the three processes
diffusion  movement of cellsosmosis  movment of cells using watercell division  dividing of cells
three processes used by cell to control the movment of substances across the cell membrance are the nuclus and ribsomes and zytoes

the mitochondria chloroplast and the eukaryotic cell
the cell moves across it by diffusion respiration and movement
cytoplasm keeps things where they are
flagella can move a protist around mitochondria moves throughout the membrane and the lysosomes hold in food for energy then when needed the food is let out
they use diffusion osmosis and water diffusion

three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are cell membrane cell wall and vascular system
1 nuclear membrane2 enyzme 3
cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane one major type of cellular movement is passive transport with passive transport the cell wont have to use any energy to move the substance the cell can use diffusion or osmosis if the cell is moving water the cell can also use active transport to move substances it can use endocytosis to bring substances into the cell or exocytosis to push substances out
one is osmosis where different parts of the cell come together to protect and control movement from the cell membrane  the second is transcription where it controls the rate and what crosses through the cell membrane the third is translation it helps create rna that can help later on to control what crosses the membrane
osmosis mitosis and meiosis
first of all cells have a semipermeable membrane that allows only what the cell wants to allow in  second cells use the cytoplasm in the cell to move and hold different substances and items that are in the cell  last of all some cells have a cell wall that doesnt allow anything in except for a few spots where the wall is discontinued
1 trna2 lysosomes3 other organelles
first the tranportation of materials the cell needs to survuve seconed the transportation of waste out of the cell and third the transportation of nutieants to the body and other cells that need it
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion miosis and movement
cells use cyotplasm for certain things to move through the human body cells also use blood to move certain proteins and cells through the body
cells use oasis mitosis and miosis  it helps water and other materials go from cell to cell
active transport diffusion passive transport
wall cells are in plants to keep the strucure of it
one of the processes used by cells would be the the nucleous to tell the cell what to do then there is the flagelum which is the tail the moves to help the crell move around the last one would be the cell membrain that holdeverytjing in and not floting out
osmosis active transport diffusion
cell respiration cell movement and cellular activation
cells can multiplycells can help organscells also move throughout the cell membrane in order to keep everything funtioning correctly

diffusion which is the processes of moving materals in and out of the cell osmosis which is the procsess of water moving in and out of the cell and fermentation which controls the proteins coming in and out of the cell
blood movement cells
the three processes used by a cell to control movement of substances across the membrane are
active transport is when what substances use to cross the cell passive transport is what the substances use to help control the cell
three processes to control the movement are diffusion osmosis and facultative diffusion osmosis is the spread of water through an area diffusion is when water is used in various parts of the organism and stored throughout the body facultative diffusion is when the nutrients are stored to be used for later
difusion helps move water based particels in and out of the cell osmosis  move non water based particels in ond out of the cell
the proteins only allow for specific organisms to pass through the cell membrane is made of material which only nonpolar organisms can pass through
diffusion is where the cell moves things acrost the membrain without using energy active trasport is a prosses that requires energy to move things acrost the cell
mitochondrian plasmids and the ribosomes
all the membranes are different from evrey other one
diffusion is one processes used by cells to cntrol movement across the cell membrane
diffusion when particles separate in the air
cells use tails to move others just slid acrossand they work together
osmosis
homeostacious
the cell membrane will only allow rna through the flag lets it know where to enter then it will only let waste out
diffusion
cell wall cell membrane nucleus
the first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low if they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides      the second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis this is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane this type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis     facilitated diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane this is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close once the substance has entered the membrane protein the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane letting the substance in
1division                                                                            2
1substances move through the organelles2trna transfers it across the cell3 transcription
active transport helps with the flow of water in the membrane protein transport helps bring enzymes into the cell the channel proteins v shaped move things in and outside of the cell also carrier proteins tube shaped move things in and outside of the cellpassive transport helps bring proteins into the cell
the cell uses threee processes by the names of mieosis mitosis and cell reproduction meosis is when the cell divides and turns into another cell aloowing them to increase in numbers mitosis is when the cell membrane forms around the nucleus to protect it  this only occurs in eukaryotic cells cell reprodustion is when cells multiply allowing more cell to be created and a person be healthier
substances go through the cell
endocytosis endocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to transport large substances into the cell exocytosis exocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to tranport large out of a cellion channels ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell are one the cell wall which is used to keep things out of it and another one is the mitochondria maximizes cellular respiration by and lysomes take unwanted proteins out of the cell
1 active transport  uses enery to move subtances through a carrier protien to the rest of the cell2 facilitated transport  does not use energy to move substances through a carrier protien3 passive transport  the suctances move right on through the membrane with using any energy
the cell membrane will open allowing and manuever nutrients into the cell the cell membrane will manuever waste out of the cell
flagellum i dont know
there are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodiumpotassium pump the sodiumpotassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell and sodium to leave a cell sodiumpotassium pumps only open one way at a time for example when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell cant move through endocytosis exocytosis and sodiumpotassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane
three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are growth synthesis and growth 2
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane are cytoplasm in the cellthe nucleoids in the cellthe nucleaus controls everything in the cell
three prosses that control the movement of a substance is the passive active and transport
osmosis allows water to move freely around inside and outside the membrane of the cell  diffusion allows wastes to exit the ceels throught selected pores in its membrane  the lipids and proteins aloow any nutrient to go through the surface of the cell
the cell wall or membrian lets the substance into the cell then the ribosions tak eover and start to break down the substance and finale mitocondrean destro and eat the substance and use it as food
osmosisexocytosis is where they take large objects out of a cell with vesiclesendocytosis is where the cell takes in objects
1 mitosis the cells seperate and move to opposite ends of the cell membrane which can somewhat guard the movements2 meosis the same process occurs as in mitosis except more cells will be produced gaining more control for the cells 3 reproduction the cells can reproduce many time then the cells can have full controll over the cell memebrane making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane
osmosis which is the diffusion of water through a semipermiable membrane is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membranecells also use facilitated diffusion in facilitated diffusion glucose molecules which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumpsactive transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane in normal diffusion water moves from high concentration to low concentration but with active transport the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration
1 selection the membrane selects what is going and is coming out
the flagellum is used for movement across the cell membraneproteins
1digestion 2reproduction 3breaking down materials
the cell membrane keeps the things from going in and out
controls what goes in and out allow substances to get inand removes any thing thats not suppose to be in there
three processes used by the cell are the mitochondria stopping substances the cell wall not letting substances into the cell and the nucleus regulaating the cells movement
the cell uses mitochondria on the cell membrane to move substances across also the cell membrane can control what substances goes in and out and it can block out certain substances lastly the cell could use flagella to help move the substances also
sperm and egs
mitosisosmosismeiosis
one process is when the ribosomes transport the genetic code across the er which can be smooth or rough
the cell wall serves as a wall to keep things from getting into the cell in order for things to move across the cell membrane they have to get in the cell walla substance may use their flagellium to move across the cell membrane
the cell can use the goolgi the move food and things around the  cell membrane also control what comes in and out of the cell
one way the cells controll movement of substances across the cell membrane is through it a second way is to go across it and the third way is to go out of it
osmosis meiosis mitosis
osmosis the substances absorb into the celldiffusion they diffuse threw out the membraneactive transport helps move on thing to another
tails are used to move cells aroundthey also use tiny hairs to swim around
the cell must know what is going across the memebrane friest so it knows if it has to keep it or get ride of it because its bad for the cell the next thing the cell should do is keep all organisms that they know they need to surive
diffusion the golgi and the rough endoplasmic reticulum
the 3 processes used by cells to control movement are osmosis diffusion and active transport
the cell membrane controls what the cell does and how it functionscellulair respiration is a process by which cells carry oxygen to the blood streamthe mitochondria is how the cells get energy
for cells to move some use the flagellum it is like a tail and moves so the cell can reach its destination other cells also scatter around until it find the right place last but not least alot of cells have tiny hairs that have a certain movement to get it where it needs to go
there is a endoplasmic reticulum that acts like a guide in the cell then there is flagella in the cell that helps control the movement there is also cytoplasm that helps the control
miosis mitosis and
osmosis diffusion of watermeiosis cell reproductionmitosis another type of cell reproduction

the three processed used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis meiosis and cellular respiration
the plasma on the out side of the membrane keeps certain things from getting in and or getting out
the move throught the blood stremthe use thir tails to move
selective permability
1the goglie bodies help by getting rid of stuff not needed in the cell 2 the cillia helps the cell move
if the cell was a plant cell it would have a cell wall that could have be used for the cells food in an animal cell it controls the amout of sugers wast and other stuf that makes the cell work equialibram helps the cell gain or lose water

osmosis is the process where water flows in and out of the cell membraneactive transport uses energy to move molecules throught he membrane of a cellpassive transport is a process where molecules move through the cell membrane without the use of energy
the endoplasmic reticulum carries things through the cell it is like a highway the cell moves water in and out of the cell in the process of trranspiration  it does this to maintain homeostasis the cell moves oxygen in and carbon dioxide of out of the cell through the process of cellular respiration  it also does this to maitian homeo stasis
they use there body movments
selective promobility is one way that the cells control the substances
cells control the movement of substamces across the cell membrane by not allowing any harmful substances through the membrane being simipermiabel by controling what can and cant go through the membrane and going throug exocytosis to get rid of any harmful waste inside the cell
movement reproduction and respiration movement to move reproduct to make more and respiration to help the body
transcriptiontranslationprotein synthesis
1 everything passes through the er2 vacuoles take care of the waste products3 rna carries information
the nuclues sends messages to the cell to tell things what to do and what is happening the ribosomes are little things that helps build energy and theres also the cytoplasm that runs through the cell membrane
mieosismitosis
the cell wall is oneit only lets certain substances enter the cellthe cytolasm is a substance that fills the cell with a jelly materialthe vacuoles moves throughout the cell getting rid of certain substances
the cell membrane blocks certain things from entering and leaving the cellcells membranes fight off any mircroorganisms that try to enter and arnt supposed tooif the cell membrane doesnt recognize it it wont let it in
the cell membrane can control what moves into and out of the cell mitosis is when the cell divides and and that can help move things across the cell membrance the cell need to grow and divide or else it would become to big and explode if it didnt control what moves into and out of it we would most likely die
the membrane surface in a cell is referred to as being semipermeable this means that only certain things are capable of entering the cell therefore the membrane would regulate what enters or leaves the cell with these particular processes happening the travel of substances across the cell membrane would be limited
they absorb the substance into the cell they surround the substance with the cell membrane or they keep the substance out of the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion facilitated diffusion and osmosis diffusion always substances to move across the cell by slowly being moved through the cell membrane facititated diffusion always larger objects to be moved across the cell membrane osmosis is where something is moved into the cell by shrinking it and then it regains its shape after being moved into the cell
the cell membrane checks to see if the substance is good or bad for the cell then the cell membrane lets the substance inside of the cell finally the substance is transported through the cell through the endoplasmic reticulum
miosisosmosisreproduction
three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion osmosis and endocytosis diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell  the materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy  osmosis is similar to diffusion but occurs with water  the water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water without using energy endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration into the cell through the membrane
osmosis is water coming in or leaving the celldiffusion is making equilibrium by moving across the membranepassive transport is where you move things into the cell from the outside
anaphase interphase and prophase
they might have a flagtum or whip like tail to move
the three processes are diffusion faciliated diffusion and osmosis
meioses cell division geting rid of waste
cells use different processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane one of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through this membrane is like a pasta strainer the strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in another way cells control movement is by atp atp is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement another way is by a cell wall cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell there are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane but these three are the most common
the three phases i know are metaphaseanaphase and telophase
the cell wal    the cell membrean
the use active transport wich requires energy to do sothey use cell respiration wich allows material to go in and out of the cell
sillianucliotides
reproduction digestionneucleus
one is active transport which takes energy to pass through the cell membrane
they can move across water they eat the other fish the can swim
cells first recognize what is going to be comming through the membrane by sending a singnal to the nucleus so it then cna decide whethere or not whatever wants to enter can then the golgi bodies transport whatever it is through the cell
three processes used by the cell to control movement of sudstances would be citoplasma nucius and mitocondrean
three processes are that the cell has a cell wall and is connected to other cells another is that it chooses what to enter it and it acts like a barrier for other things
telephase gives the information to the nucleusanaphaseinterphase
they use the cytoplasm to move substances to their right place
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mrna which gives instructions to a cell trna which transfers stuff to a cell
equilibrilum
1passed to a cell2goes through something3gets to cell membrane
lipidsprotines and carbohydrates
1 osmosiscontrols the amount of water in a cell2 vacolesare organelles that help control excessive water and substances being moved around the cell membrane3 cells go through photosynthesis substances such as oxygen are controlled
the substances that move across the cell membrane are dna protiens and mrna
movement energy and mutation
they could have a cell wall  they have guard calls and ribosomes
mrnatrnarna
1 they could build up ane enzyme to help protect the cell2 they could get rid of material that is in the way3 they could create an easier passageway
the cytoplasm moves stuff across the membrane
they use channel proteins to move stuff in and out of the cellthey also use receptor proteins to move stuff in and out
protein channel moves larger substances across the cell
absorb food
the nucleus
the use of a flagellum  protist uses a flagellum to move
cells are selectively permeable the regulate the waste inside of the cell and ribosomes regulate movement in cells
cross pollinationdistribution of energy the cell wall lets bad things out and traps the good things in
they have layers which regulate what can enter and exit the cell membrane they have a screenlike function that detects weather or not a substance is sizable to enter the membrane
they have cytoplasm which holds all the organelles and substances in the membrane  they have a cell membrane which keeps organelles and substances inside the cell the endoplasmic reticulum also moves the substances around
they divideseparatereproduce
1 see if the organism is inffected2 move the organism to the cell membrane3 check the organism4move the oranism out of the cell
active transport helps get things through the membrane
osmisis one using energy one not using energy
the first procees used to control movement of substances across the cell membrane would be trascription which takes protein and turns it into mrna translation takes mrna and decodes it for the cell to read and use osmosis is another process used by cells osmosis makes the fluid in a cell try and reach equalibrium
one type of movement control is passive transportation
eye spot flagellum and contracule vacule
one would be reproducton
there are three processes that i know of that are used by cells and they are passive and active passive means that the substance is able to pass right through active is when it has to go through a process to go through the cell memebrane diffusion is another one substances diffuse to go through the cell membrane
through regeritationthrough blood flow through urination
diffusion sugar is absorbed into the membrane and travels down the gradient levelfaciliated diffusion requires energy to move down the gradientactive transport particles are held in a pocket then are brought to the membrane and are released out of the cell
cytoplasm vacuole ribosomes
carryoutthe cells take the substance across the membranemiosiscell transformation moves the informationmitosis second part moves the rest of the cell in its transformation
cells use osmosispassive transport and also diffusion to control the movemnet of substances across the cell membrane
1 they move in a slow motion to ger across the member2 they do not come in contact with one another3 they are constantly moving
cell division cellular respiration cell wall
diffusion which allows materials to pass in and out osmosis through which water passes through the membrane and active transport in which specialized processes transport materials past the membrane
they let substances in  and out through the membrane  all the organs in the cell have a suspecific job to do to get what the cell needs
cell membranes let go of waste eat and engulf food and can block bad stuff from getting in
they are transferedthey carry the substances
cells use different organels inside the cell to move substances across it three processes of moving substances would be using the mitocondria to move waste from the cell the cell wall also helps filter and move waste in and out of the cell the cell nucleus controls what goes in and out of the cell as well thats a few ways cells use movement
they control the movement across the cell mambrane by taking control of each individual part of the cell
diffusionrespirationomnosis
cells use vacules to allow water in and out of the cellcells use osmosis to allow the movent of water acrossed the cell or into the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be that they 1 the cell cycle 2 reproduction
meiosis is used throughout the cell membrane to control and develop more cells mrna and rna are used as messengers to carry the information to the needed destination lastly the information is received and it has ended
trna mrna rrna
three processes that control the movement of substances across the cells membrain are equalibrium the consentration gradiant and cell division the consentration gradiant is when the partical move from higher consentration to lower consentration if the cells consentration gradient is to high it can brust or if it is to small it will shring so it has to be normal
repiration
the cell membrane protects the cell
pores in the membrane allow substances in and out of the cellgolgi body helps transport substances in and out of cellmrna moves dna sequences from place to place in and outside of the cell
active transporttransports the portiensosmosistransfers thingsdiffusiongets rid of things
the cell membrane controls what goes in and out of the cell the nuclues is the brain of the cell and it controls what goes on inside the cell the cell wall is barrier to sources outside of the cell and protects the cell
they use ribosomes to carry stuff around the cellthe nuclieus is the brain that helps controll the cellthe cell is small enough to move stuff across it
the cells are movement  of substances
floatno movementwalk
they use the pump function which pumps out solutes so it wont become overfilled with too much water they use osmosis which is the movement of water against the natural flow they have transport proteins which allow things to come through the cell
trnasends a message to the nucleus  translation gets waste material out
1osmosiswater passing through the cell membrane and does not require energy2 active diffusiondiffuses large particles through the cell membrane and requires energy3 passive diffusiondiffuses small particles through the cell membrane and does not require energy
they use transport proteins to move across sugars across the membranethey use messenger rna to send codons to the amino acid sequencethey use rna to help stabilize the cell
rnacytoplasmcell membrane they all go through the process of movement of substances in  a cell
they use a system and it gets rid of the stuff that the cell doesnt need it gets food and stuff like that for the cell to survive and it helps the cell reproduce
interphase which is the longest phase in the cell
the three are slime filagine and micro organisums
trna transports proteins to the nucleusmrna carries genetic information
cellular respirationmeiosismitosis
the way the cells move around
movement in the membrane
dna meosis   rna and protein synthesis 
centreles fluids and proteins
there are three different types of processes a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane the first type of movement is called active transport which is when the cell is physically doing something the second type of movement is called passive transport which is when the cell itself if inactive and the person is doing the work the third type of movement is osmosis which is the diffusion of water
energybloodother
they use the flagellum to move therefore it could help move things across the membrane also the muscles like with blood flow and finally the heart because it pumps blood and oxygen all over the body
three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis diffusion and active transport osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane it requires no energy so it is called anerobic diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration this process uses energy or atp because it goes against the concentration gradient
endocytosis is used to let large mollecules into cells exocytosis is used to get them out of the cells
three processes used to control cell movement are
mitosos meisosis are two ways that cells control the movement across the cell membrane because they are the cycles where new cells are formed
cillia flagella and
digestionrespirationinversion
on the cell membrane there are little holes that are selectivley premable which allows only certian things to cross and not cross into the cell
one way you can transfer substances through a cell is by the use of water or otherwise known as osmosis a second way you could transfer substances is by transfering enzymes through the cell membrane a third way substances get transfered through the cell membrane is using mrna to transfer proteins through the cell
1 flagella2 plasma membrane3 mitochondria
cell wallblocks unwanted material from getting incytoplasmhelps regulate rna
osmosses difussion and the membraine
when a cell needs energy or food the plasma membrane lets the food inside of the cell where it is processed by mitochondria on the cell membrane there is a series of locking nodules that prevent unwanted substances from entering the cell also things like cilia and flaggellum aid in cell movement and could also possibly aid in the movement of substances
mitosis moving cells
the three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are mitosis meiosis and passive passive is when substances can get through easily meiosis is also the process how cells divide as mitosis is too
the nucleus helps control the movement of substances across a cell membrane by telling the substance where to gothe cell wall also helps guide it through keeping the nucleus from getting stuck or trapped in something  because the cell wall is  there to protect it and keep unneeded things out
1 osmosis the differation of water across a membrane2 active permeability the ability of a membrane to control what flows in and out via special organelles this is done with carrier proteins that carry the materials against the grain3 freeflow permeability permeability in which the materials naturally flow into or out of without the help of carrier proteins
flaglummoves cellcillia help cell stick to surfaces
reproductionresprationnucleus
cells use several diffrent processes some examples are how the cells use the nucleus to manuver and plan the movements that allow the substances to travel across the cell wall some of the cells use their ribosomes to manuverthem then they could also use their endoplasmic reticulum or their er to make this process possible this is only a few posible ways that cells could control the movement of substances across the cell membrane

division the cells move upon division as well as reproducingentering the cell membrane allows certain things to go in and come out then theyll move on to the next thinglockandkey the cell allows a ligant to connect and bring glucose in the cell
the three processes used by the cells to control the movement are through protein chemicals lysomes throughout hte cell and through the blood
osmois which is the movement of water through a cell membranediffusion the brackage of tissues along the cel membranehomostatis which is the internal balance
the cell membrane uses diffusion and osmosis
1 osmosis the movement of water in and out of cells2 difussion the movement of particles on and out of cells3 though proteins
the three things used by cells are cellular resperation
1 free pass or moving freely through the membrane2 diffusion or the movement of water from high pressure area to low pressure are through the membreane3 proteins or the movement of proteins through special small tubes in a cells membrane
diffusion evens out substances so they reach equilibrum which is when they are evenly spread throughout a spaceosmosis is the diffusion of waterthe cell membrane is constructed so that certian substances can fit in through it and others cant
they control the movement by telling things where to go
one is there protein that helps it movetwo is all the cells inside of itthree is all the things inside it
the cell membrane has 3 processes that it has1 it protects the cell 2 it moves the cell in any way3 it can bring food in or out
the genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus when they are switched to mrna also known as messenger rna that sends a message to the organelles stating that the genetic code needs a specific substance the third process  is trna or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle the whole process then repeats itself
diffusion if a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium it will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite this is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesnt require any energyfacilitated diffusion if the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane then protein pumps help these carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy this is also a type of passive transportosmosis osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water if concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium if the concentration is lower outside the cell then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium
selctionthe membrane choosess what substancess can come inside the cell i dont knowi dont know
it is that if one can do with out it will not go no were if the movement of the substance it will move all around the world if you
cells use endocytosis exocytosis and osmosis to move between membranes     in endocytosis material is encased and becomes part of a cell in exocytosis the cell encases things inside of itself and sends them outin osmosis water is difused and material travels through the membrane
facilitated diffusion allows only certain molecules through membrane and is not going against concentration gradientosmosis the diffusion of water across a membraneprotein channels integral and peripheral proteins carry substances into and through membrane into the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of subtances across the cell membrane are enzymes can move them
osmosis is the moving of water across the membraneendocytosis is things happening in the cellexocytosis is things happening outside the cell
gel in the cells can help transport substances around the cell membrane
they have the whip like structurecells to control the movement and to gather the food gather up and move as a team to protect each other
cell membrane allows certain materials to move around the cells
osmosis active transport and passive transport  active transport moves substancces freely across the cell membrane osmosis is where plants slowly absorb substnces and passive transport moves substances across the cell membrane slowly
one way of movement is the use of flagellum witch is a long tail like structure the moves behind the cellthe second is cilia witch are like tiny hair like structers that are all over a cell witch give it mo bilty
photosynthesis is the process in which an organism collects enegry from sunlighthomeostasis is the process in which an organism stores and collects enegryanother process in which an organism produces its own enegry
cells breaking down feeding the cells and letting the cells grow
the three substances that control the movement across the call membranethe call wallclorplastmitochondrion
osmosisactive transportpassive transport
as one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane cells use selective permeability selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldnt cells also use passive transport which requires no energy from the cell itself to do the same thing finally cells use active transport which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy two types of active transport are endocytosis the process of letting materials into the cell and exocytosis the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell
there are different kinds of processes that cells use in this case in humans such as1 the white blood cells control how much blood is lost and  they are in charge of healing the spot were it is cut2 the red blood cells controll the blood coming from the heart to throughout the body3 the brain cells can control brain functions and how much blood is taken from the heart and aloud into the brain
the three processes that help a cell control the substance movements over its membrane could be diffusion the movement of any particles through the membrane or equilibrium which is the outer concentration being equal to the one inside and the process in which the cell produces energy which is transfered out of the cell
celluar respiration
the cell membrane is a thicklayered wall that can sometimes prevent what goes in and out of the cell  it also detects what is suppose to get into the cell
the cell membrane sends out messages to other parts of the bodymovement sends vibrations over the cell membrane causing it to function in different ways
1 the cell membrane blocks cells from moving around2 a process called cellular respiration3 a process called cell diffusion
osmosis diffusion endocytosis controls what comes into the cell
active transport passive transport and protein channels
the cytoplasm helps to hold all of the organells and helps things to move the nucleus determines if the substance can enter the cellif the substance can enter the cell the cytoplasm allows it to enter
the nucleus controls everythingthe mitochondria tells wat enters and leaves the cell
the cells need enzymes to live that help them make tissues then make organells like the heart lungs and mussels
the way the cell membrane is designedit lets so much water in it
osomises the balancing of water inside and outside of a cell or necleausi dont remember the other two
cell mebranes are semipermeable they only allow certain things to enter in and out of the membraneproteins can be on the mebrane to guide things into the cell through active transportdiffusion allows items to go from a high concentration area to a low concentration area through the membrane
acctive transport diffusion nonactive transport
most cells have a cell wall to controll what goes in and out of the cell membrane red blood cells carry oxygen around the blood stream white blood cells fight off diseases
they can diffuse and seperate
proteins control movementnucleus controls the cellsdna makes proteins
the cell membrane
photosynthesis cellular respiration and the phosphorus cycle
nuclear membrane always allows co2 and oxygen to enter and exit but does not allow solid objects through that do not fit through the protein channelpassive transport water travels from greater to lesser with no energy being used osmosisactive transport water travels from lesser to greater by the use of the cells enegy
transportatin when protien is giving infomation to other cellinfomation when a cell is told to do somthingthe cell does it
if the object is small enough it can fit right through the cell membrane but if it is a larger object then it has to wait to go through the holes that open and close
cells conrol movement by useing flagellen and enzymes to encounter the product of movement
osmossis is the diffusion of water diffussion is moving objects through the membrane
active transportmovement of molecules from an area of hugh concentration to an area of low concentrationpassive transport is two process in one it used simple diffusion and filacated diffusion
1 osmosis is the emovement of water throught the cell membrane2 diffusion is when more water ends up on one side of the cell membrane3osteoporosis
1resperation is one way it takes substances across the cell2 food gathering also is another way when it gathers the food3 cell selection is another way they select what they want
the cell nucleus controls what goes in to the cell and comes out of it
the nucleus holds all the nutrients
active transport uses energy and goes against the gradient diffusion moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area osmosis also moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area
1it controls the blood going through your veins2it filters the waist products3it helps the blood count
passive passive movement is where an organism or substance can get through the membraneactive active movement is where the thing has to go through the channel protein to enter the cellosmosis water can pass easily through the membrane
moves slow becase of the enyzyms
cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell its like a security guard in the white house the nucleus reads the information and decides if it should leave or enter the cell the cell wall protects what enters and leaves the cell also
the three processes used by cells are they
they would have a moving processes
mutation diversity and homeostastis
three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport passive transport and a semipermable membrane  active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy  passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy  a semipermable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in
photosynthesisosmosiswater diffusion
trnamitochondria
reproduction
the cell membrane is the reproducion because this cell es movemen
passive transport moves substances without assistance across a membrane it goes from high concentration to lower ones active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient vesicles are pouches that the cell uses to transport large particles it suronds the object and pinches it off
active transporttransport that uses energy in transporting objests across the membranediffusiondiffusion of objects across a permeable membraneosmosismovment of water across a membrane
one process used by the cell to control movement accross the cell membrane is through energy the cell uses its energy to control the movement across its membrane another way is by endocytosis endocytosis helps bring things into the cell lastly there is exocytosis exocytosis is when things are being removed from the cell
one process would be cell growth and metabolism  because to move you need to have the right metabolism so you have the energy to even move in the first place     a second process could be protein synthesis  because you obviously need all the protein you can get to keep you moving throughout the days of hard work      a third process is the creation of cells  this is a big part of cell movement you cant just have one cell and expect it to do everything like move create energyetc
osmosis diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane cellular respiration diffusion of oygen in the cell
the cell membrance have immune system to know what is coming in to your body the atttact force that the immune system let out and how we do thing to our body
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are when the cell membrane uses proteins to allow substances through the membrane when small particles enter through the cell membrane and when particles too large to enter the membrane through proteins use enzymes to make the particles smaller
diffusionosmosistransfusion
endocytosis controls what is brought into the cell through the cell membraneexocytosis controls what is put out of the cell through the cell membranesoddium potassium pump contols how much sodium is left inside the cell and how much of the extra is put out of the cell it also decides how much potassium is left outside the cell and how much of it is put inside the cell
flagellem helps them move cili help them move and moving side to side or something like a motion of a snake
cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane      type one is passive transport this occurs when the cell dosent use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane     type two is active transport this occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane     type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you
the three processes include trna mrna and rrna
the cell membrane is controlloed by the nucleous and it goes through processes called meioses reproduction
rna vacoules  proteinsthey each move things across the cell
cell to cell contact
dna  mrna  trna
facultative diffusion particles moving through the protein channels from hig to low concentrationdiffusion something moving through a cell membrane from high to low concentrationosmosis water moving through a cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration
passive transport is what lets everything enter and leave the cell active transport is the movement of the cell an the nucleus is what controls everything
the cell has has a cell membrane top control the movement a cell also contains proteins which determine what does and does not enter the cell and finally the nucleus being the brain of the cell also controls the movement across the cell membrane
the cell membrane is around the the cell to protech it from every viosas from coming in the cell also gives the cell food to eat
osmosis
cells have cell walls they block things from getting in and leaving they protect them
one they could move all around the cell membrane and end up in nucleustwo they could pop out of the cell membrane and be left outside of the cell membranethree they could just stay in the cell membrane
1 prophase 2 anaphase3 metaphase
endoabsorbing allows substances to enter a cell through the layer of proteins in the cell membranes
1interphase2telopahse3metaophase4anaphase
cell wallvacuole
the cell transfer that energy to the golgi appartus an then it is taken by the lysomes to cell membrane where it is disposed of
osmosis  diffusion of water through the cell membraneactive transport  cell uses activation energy to surround and engulf the objectpassive transport  cell uses no energy and lets the object pass through the cell membrane with a special protein
first the protien comes up to the opening to pass through then it uses passive transport or transport protiens to open the cell membrane and allow the protien to pass through
1  cells is what your body has in it so you can live2  cells cary anything to where ever it goes3
telophaseanophase
there are many ways a cell controls the movement if substances across the cell membrane  one of them would be by only letting things go from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration to maintain homeostasis  another way is when a receptor protein is triggered to make a channel move things in or out of the cell a third thing is when a pump is told by the nueclus to work
enzynes break down protein builds up and everything is sent to the nucleous
cells will either allow or reject substances into the cell through its cell membrane  once a substance is inside of the cell it moves through the cell  when it leaves the cell it leaves through respiration
the cell moves the to another placethe membrane controls where the cells go
cells use selective permiability to let things in and out of the cell that are smaller and cells use transport proteins to move larger objects
they use diffusion to bring things in and out of the body they use fission to move things around in the body
the cell uses its cell membrane to monitor what goes in and out of a cell  one processes lets substances enter the cell and one process releases substances from then cell  they can control the movement through diffusion which means that particles are spread apart equally inside and outside of the cell also the cell uses osmosis which controls the movement of water
cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane cells can also use diffusion active transport requires the cells energy and exports things out of the membrane
the cells move by the flow of cells cells do their certain jobs and cells protect the membrane
there are thre different movements for substances in a cell  one movement of substance is when the cell is swelling and is too full and to move it it uses a method to push the substance to another cell  another movement is when there is less substance in a cell causing it to shrink and it uses a method to let substances enter  when the cell is making substance leave it is pushing against the normal flow making it harder and using  more energy but bringing more substance in for a cell uses little to no energy at all for a cell  the third method is when two cells are equlvalent in substance to each other and does not swell or shrink but stays constant
the three processes are prophase metaphase and anaphase
anaphase prophasetelophase
the cells use the mitochondria to move things across the cell membrane  they also use thier golgi bodies and endoplasmic reticulum
one way is when cells go and they start to divid and split a part to make new cells
cell devisioons and cell reproductions
tansmitting copying
sugar cells tubicles and charbohydrates
they have a cell membrane to control what comes in and outthey try to capture foodthey remove things they dont need
anaphase telophase prosphase
itmblocks substances from entering or leaving the cell membrane
the cell necluous sends information to the other cells to move the whole organism
the first process used by cells to control the movement of substances acrossed the cell membrane are ion channels they let only ions pass through the lipid bilayer and move along the cell the second process that is used are carrier proteins they help carry the proteins acrossed the cell the third way used is enzymes they help move the substances across the cell so they can pass through the cell membrane
cell wall it helps keep the substance in the membrane
passive transport active transport and diffusionpassive transport is things leaving and entering the cell without using any energyactive transport is using energy to move things into or out of the celldiffusion is when an area of higher concentration moves that substance that it is concentrated in to an area with a lower concentration
when the something wants to get through there is a signal sent and then a protein channel will open up and the item will get throughsome of the items that want to get through will be able to just slide through the phophilipidsothers can go through by the other proteins that will open up to let others in
the cell may send signals to the membrane and it will go the cell may also have helped by giving it dna the cell may have communicated with other cells in the organism
1 nucleus is the boss tells the cell what to do2 vacuole cleans everything up3 mitochondria produces energy4 mitosis makes new cells5 meosis makes new sex cells
one is the ribosomestwo is the microtidsthree is the microtons
interphase is the biging of the cell cycle where the chromatids duplicate anaphase the second is the stage where the nucleus dissapears prophase is where the sister chromatids line up in the middle of the cell
flagellumosmosis
one process is through the use of cyclins another way is through the cytoplasm lastly is by use of carrier protiens
they use passive transport active transport and possecive transport
reproductionflagellanucleus
a cell uses diffusion osmosis and active transport to move substances across th e cell wall
cells have a cell wall which controls what goes in and out of the cell
cell division the movement of cells away from each other cell wall where the cell movement takes place and moves across the membranecells use atp to produce energy for the movement of cells
diffusion liquid slowly spreads solid through liquid until its spread out evenly ex powdered chocolate in chocolate milk
hyper hypo osmosis
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are dna movement respiration and food gathering
the membran when it go to the nuclus when the cell needs rna
cells have many different substances that need moving across the membrane one process would be electron transport chain etc the electron transport chain or etc carries neutrons across the cell membrane another process would be active transport active transport is used in prokayreotes and eukaryotes it carries waste out and carries proteins in one last thing that cells use is diffusion diffusion carries everything the cells need across the cell membrane and balances the waste products
cell membranes are selectively permeable this means that the phosphid bilayer which makes up the membrane will allow certain substances to enter and leave the cell while keeping other substances at bay
diffusionactive transportpassive transport
telophase prophaseanaphase
nucliuscellwall
active transport    osmosisdiffusion
facilitated diffusion from high to low concentatrationosmosis from low to high concentrationpermeable mambrain allows the substances to pass in ot out of the cell
cell wall nucleus and the cell membrane help control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
protein gets to the cell it helps the muscles move
the cell membrane is selectively permiable and lets some supstances in but not others  in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell  osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell
the cell is like a fillter on both sides one side lets water and oxygen in and the other side try to kept jerms bactrea and other bad things out
osmosis is the difussion from one membrane to anotheractive transport is the active use of atp to transport materials
cytoplasm
1 cells have a flagella that helps them move2 cells have cilla that help them move3 cells are forced to mve
they slide because its slippery its really cramped in there because every thing is so close then they are molded into place and they stay there untill there job is complete
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mrna trna and rna
they use osmosis to go through the cell membrane using watercellular respiration feeds the substance through with the help of the mitochondrion protien synthesis goes through the membrane after the ribosomes produce them
seperate they grow apartreproduce the multiply     conjoin the from together
osmosis movement of water through the cell mambranediffusion materials entering the cell though the membraneexocytosis releasing of waste though the membrane
protein syntheis evolution and evolving
the cell wall has evolved over time in organisms to control movement of substances both in and out of cells  this includes not allowing in germs or harmful bacteria as well as putting them out and allowing in things needed for cell function  also the lysosome in a cell removes unwanted or dead proteins from a cell  the cell membrane is a third regulatory structure of the cell used much like the cell wall
the three processes used by cells are diffusion osmosis and isotonicosmosis is the movement of water from high to low othrough a barrier to level the isotonic levels diffusio is the movement of water from low to high to even out the levels of water
they move wastes through the cell  they use cytoplasm to move stuff through cells  they ahve holes in the cell membrane or cell wall to regulate what goes in and out
the processes that control the movement of a substance across the cell membrane are the movement and the resperation these help tell what is going on with the cell membrance and what kind of interactions it might come to
they have movements that help the cell produce enought energy to movethe cells must have an energy source that will allow them to move and have a normal cell growthwhile things are going past the cell membrane they have to watch for certain thigs that will allow the mto keep them safe
they use the flagella they divide and multipy
active transport passive transport osmosis
1 macroo molecules like proteins help substances move across the cell membrane2 lipids also help the substances move across the cell membrane
they all connect to each other
the cell crosses over the membrane
translation transcription and protein synthesis
obmostist difigion
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane include the flagella cell wall and cytoplasm     the flagella is a tail like attachment of a cell that allows the cell to move around         the cell wall protects the cell and allows only specific particles in and out of it          the cytoplasm is picky and only allows certain materials to pass through it as well
osmosis diffusion and equilibrium
1 the cells have to divide so they dont get to big if they get to big then the process will take longer or not go all the way through2when the cells go through the process miosis and mitois they make more cells3 the more cells there are the healthier the membrane is
flagellum
against the flow movement that takes physical energy to move the substanceswith the flow this requires no energy to to move across the surface
meiosismitosis the cell divides into twoviscosity where water flows on the substance
diffusionis the movement of somthing froma higher concentration to a lower concentrationosmosisis the movement of water from higher concentrations to lower concentrations through a membranesodium pottasium pump the use of energy to transfer sodium and pottasium ions from lower concentrations to higher concentrations
photosynthesis active transport
the cell membrane tries to equal up the movement of substances from side to side first the subtances flow freely through the membrane then when the cell has gotten enough substances the membrane sends substances out of the cell
cells use the cell membrain to move and some cells use there flugelam to sem and use it to swim
transporting reproducing and protecting they have to transport food all around the cell and different functions the cells have to reproduce to make more cells to live the cell wall protects the inside of the cell so nothing gets out
cell wallprotects by keeping the bad stuff out
reproduction
they use the cell wall to keep bad things out and good things in
one way is that they cross thhe cerrebellum to get acrossthe second way is that it passes through the spineand idk a third one
flagella helps the cell move cilla which also helps the cell move slime on the cell wall helps the cell move
defensecontrol blood
the cell can use the ion channel to get ions in and out the cell can also use the sodium potassium pump to move sodium in and potassium out then the last thing they can use is an enzyme the enzymes can cause the bigger ions that can not fit though the ion channel help them move across the cell membrain so they can come in and help the cell function properly
selective permiability it only allows certain things to move in and out of the cellhomeostasis it regulates the water balance in the cells so the cell can have an isotonic solution
the cells verifies the substances first second it opnes the wall to the accepted substance once the substance is through it closes the whole and waits for another substance to come by
it removes waste through the body separates good and bad materials lastly it fights against bad things that enter the cells
they move with flagellas and silla
the cell has certain proteins that match up with certain substances and then lets them into the celldiffusion is when the cell lets a higher concentration of water move to a lower concentration of waterosmosis is when a higher concentration of substances move to a lower concentration of substances
they use protiens to move substances
one use would be to remove wastes another use would be to recieve proteins or other necessities finally it can be used to keep out harmful substances
the nucleus controls all the cells functions the membrane controls what goes in and out of the cellthen i guess that the mitochondrian control the food intake
the golgi body releases substances uneeded and send out of the membrane the nucleus tells some substances where to go in the cell because that is like the brain of the cell and also through the mitochondria which is the powerhouse of the cell it tells some substances how to help the cell
the cell membrane has a semi premiable membrane that only lets certain things go in and out of the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is flagella which helps the cell get throught the membrane the nucleus that is the control center and the cell wall to protect the cell from any unwanted cells or anything unwanted

endocytosis exocytosis and cellular respiration are the three processs used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membraneendocytosis is when the substance moving across the cell membrane is brought into the cellexocytosis is when the substance is brought out of the cell
1 the cell membrane blocks whatever is trying to come in until it knows that it is safe to enter the cell without doing harm2 it helps block any unwanted subsances from passing into the cell if they got passed the cell wall3 it can control what leaves the cell if it is not supposed to leave then the cell membrane or cell wall will keep it from leaving if it is supposed to leave it will let it pass through
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell inlcudes carrying proteins to differents parts of the cell carrying genetic information and many other jobs and processes as well
it is the nucleus
osmosis which is the process of moving substances using wateractive transport which is where the cells move substances across themselves and passive transport which is where the substances just pass through
osmosisselectively permeable and diffussion
the cellular respiration process controls the water flow throughout a cell membrane the mrna transports messages throughout the cell and the trna produces proteins
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances are the cellular tissue this controls what goes in and out of the cell  then lysosomes that control what waste leaves the cell  followed by ribosomes that make proteins
active transport allows substances to move across the cell membrance from low to high concentration active transport uses energyosomis allows substances to move across the cell membrance without using energy therefore moving from a high to low concentrationdiffusion allows substances to move across the cell membrane by diffusing them across the cell
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the following1 osmosis2 meiosis3 mitosis
1 diffusion 23
osmosis difusion and phospholipid difusion are three processes by which a substance can move across the cell membrane osmosis is the dirusion of a substance through a selectively permeable membrane usually a substance such as water difusion is the difusion of other semismall chemicals or atoms moving across the membrane phospholipid difusion is the difusion of larger chemicals or atoms across a membrane with the use of a protien
endocytosis the movement of large amounts of materials into the cell with the use of energyexocytosis the movement of large amounts of materials out of the cell with the use of energymaterials also move down across the concentration gradient from high density to low density without the use of energy in a cell

osmosis movement by water
gelate genome ganglian
diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane  substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration  active transport is also used  atp is important in taking the substances across the membrane  atp allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient  protein carriers also control movement of substances  protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell  all of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane
the cell process controls what enters and leaves tthe cell membrane it helps control the movement and helpoi t function better
1osmosis lets certain things pass through water2 diffusion pushes things out of the cell3 also by being selectively permeable and only letting certain things enter the cell
facilitated diffusion is a way that substances move from one form of concentration to another form of consintration diffusion it takes substances from an area of high concentration to low consintraion osmosis deals with the water bieng moved
well the cell have to move though the membrane to the chain of reaction
the cells divide 23 chromosomes for a male and 46 chromosomes for a female mitosis and meiosis take place in the function of a cell and enzymes help proteins to be made diploid is all 46 chromosomes haploid is half and that is only 23
miosis mitosis and interphase
interphase anaphase telophase
the concentration gradient moves things throught the cell pushing them although exocytosis uses its own energy to push things such as waste out of the cell
osmosis the diffusion of materials through water particlesactive transport moves materials by using energypassive transport moves materials without using energy
transcription
cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane a cells membrane is selectively permeable cells also use passive and active transport passive transport requires no energy some form of passive transport include osmosis diffusion and facilitated diffusion active transport unike passive reguires energy to move things through the cell membrane
cells use the organelles to help move things they often have many different ways to move things they also use the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum
mitochondria  stores and releases energynucleus  contains all the information needed for the cell to functionrespiration  take in nutrients and releases wastes
cell wallallows things to move in and out of the cellcell membraneprotects the nucleusmotochondriait duplicates
a chain is the process used by cells to move something across the cell the chain passes it from one to another and so on another way is when the phosphates that have two tails and a head keep things out of the cell this makes the substances bounce back enzymes speed up the process

the size of the holes in the membrane the flow of cytoplasm the size of the substance trying to move through the organism
translation transcription
lipids allow water to pass out of the cell but not into itoxygen is allowed to pass through the cell membrane but not other gases
transportation is where the cell transports proteins and sugars transcription is where the cell rads what kind of protein or sugar its dealing with transformation is when they transform into bigger cells
active transport  it is used by the cell membrane to transfer items throughout the cells  the cell membrane decides if the items can pass through the cell or not  distribution the cell membrane will also use distribution to decide what items go to each part of the cell and how much will be sent to the organelles  these items could be things like water or other fluidsseperation the cell membrane can decide at any time what to seperate in a cell or out of the cell  it can split up ribosomes or keep fluids from entering the cell  the cell membrane is the main protector of the cell
the cells can be carried through th blood stream
to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane the cell uses various different structures and processes the monitor this such as the golgi apparatus

meiosis mitosis photosynthesis
pmat helps regulate the cells
1 diffusion  substances diffuse into the cell by moving from a place of high concentration to a low concentrated area2 the movement of substances from a low concentration to a high concentration have to use energy in the cell from the mitochondria3 the cell expells wastes from the cell membrane such as broken down parts of foreign materials by breaking them up by the ribosomes so they can be transferred through the membrane and expelled as quick as possible

the 3 processes cells use to controll movement would be the physoplic biolayer which knows what goes in and out of the cell then phosphates send the message about the movement and then the orgenelles inside move from one place to another
the cell membrane only allows certain materials intop the cell by guarding the wall
1 photosynthesis     2 cell respiration     3 mitosis
endocytosis which is part of active transport where the cell uses energy to pull items through the selectively permeable membraneexocytosis part of active transport the cell uses energy to push items out of the celldiffusion part of passive transport the cell does not use energy to gain the items it wants but lets the items move through the selectively permeable membrane
the cell movements are
prokaryotes ukaroyotes ribosomes
they move in litle gorps and eat batrea and can reporduce asexually
the cell membrane is a jelly like substance
meiosis mitosis and oserosis
the cell membrane keeps in nutrients and things that are vital for the cell to live  it also pushes stuff out such as waste that is not necessary or could be harmful to the cell  lastly the cell membrane acts as a protector to protect the cell from anything that could possibly harm or damage it
one process is active transport which is transport with the aid of transport proteins transport proteins help to get the substances to move through the plasma membrane another process is passive transport which is not very differet from active transport except this transport does not use the aid of transport proteins the substances move without thema third process is exocytosis or endocytosisexocytosis is the secreting or expelling of unwanted materials or wastesendocytosis is the surrounding and engulfing of materials

a cell uses the plasma to hold all of the organelles in place
some cells use flagelam for movement
the cell wall processes the movement in and out of the cell
the substance go through the membrane
different parts of the cell control the movement of substances across the cell membrane  the nucleus carries out genetic information such as dna to the rest of the cell  the mitochondrian transport energy throughout the cell  the cytoplasm allows this movement to take place throughout the cell as well
cells are the basic unit of all living things cells have numerous functions such as fighting off infections when they enter out body they also transport information all over our body they let the rest of our bodies know what theyre suppose to do cells also keep us living and breathing
they use movement
cells carry information to other cells cells push out unwanted or unnecessary materials from the bodycells created other cells
everything that leavess or enters the cell goes through pore membranesphotosynthesis helps give nutrients to plants by absorbing light and carbon dioxide and makes sugar for the plant
diffusion allows the flow to be controled osmosis lets water in while the surface area decreases
the cell membrain only let certain stuff in to the nucleus

cells use diffusion to get materials through the cell membrane they also use osmosis to get water in and out of the cell some also use facilitated diffusion which uses energy to move things
cell divitioncell reproductioncell movement
there are certain cell organelles that controll what goes in and out of the cell also substances are moved in and out of the cell by diffusion another way is cells are able to controll how much of sometimes goes in or out of the cell
cells are the primary block in life and are responsible for for the many complex things that we do  cells make tissue that make organs that make organ systems 
diffusion meioses
they use flagelates pseudopods or cilia
cells have a cell membrane that controls the movement of substances that come in and out of the cell also the surface area plays a roll in controlling the movement of substances aswell along with the cell membrane and the surface around the volume of the cell also has a part in controlling the movement of substances if the surface area of a cell is bigger than the volume of a cell it will make it difficult for things to move across the cell it is the same as if the volume is larger than the surface area
prophase anaphase telophase
there is a process called osmosis to move substances in and out of cells cells also have proteins that move substances around the membrane lastly cells use channel proteins which channel energy

protien synthesis moves the protien around the cellthe cell membrane doesnt let certain things in or out of the cellamio acids
meiosis mitosis
they move the cellsthey keep them were the need to be
one process the cell uses to move substances across the membrane is through the nucleus the nucleus of a cell contains genetic material called dna which tells the cell which processes to do this process includes movement across the cell  secondly the cell membrane in general is a regulator of what can and cannot enter and exit the cell  last of all in the process of transfering dna to other parts of the cell mrna moves across the cell to ribosomes in order for the dna to be processed and used for a specific cause this example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane
the cytoplasm helps regulate what comes in and outthe cell wall controls what leaves and comes inribosomes carry proteins throughout the cell
the cell membrane desides what can go into the cell and what cant
osmosis diffusion and equilibrium
the nucleus tells where each individual needs to go
cells can use osmosis which is the diffusion of water across a cell membranecells can use facilitated diffusion which is the movement of particales across a membranecells can use passive or active transport active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein this uses energy  passive transport does not use channel proteins nor does it use energy
they use one process where it just glides across the cellone process is used to carry it overand one process is used to slide it across the cell transcription translation and transversion
the cellular membrane stops unwanted materials from getting into the cell the nucleus decides what it wants inside of the cellthe cytoplasm slows untwanted materials so they can be killed

the tree processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are blood flow going to the cells oxygen flow and nutrients flow
one process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis osmosis is moving water across a membrane there is hypertonic osmosis which is moving water out hypotonic which is moving water in and isotonic which is equal water moving in and out another process is using a protein channel the protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids another process if diffusion which is moving particles from high concentration to low concentration
flagella is a long tail cilia little hair like things
sodium potassium pumpchannelsvacuoles
the nucleas helps it
difutionactive transportelectron transport
cells use chloroplasts to absorb nutrients and it is used as an organizer for transporting substances through out the cell cells also use the mitochondria to move substances the mitochondria is like the cells organizer it balances out the substances and sends them where they need to go
one way the cell controls the movement across the membrane is by knowing where to go aniother way is by swimming to where it needs to go and the last way i moves is by just moving there
cells can use the process of osmosis which has water pass through its barrier a second process is diffusion lastly a third process is facilitated diffusion
photosynthesisflagellum
passive transportwhere no energy is needed for the transportation of things in or out of the cellactive transportwhere energy is required for the transportation of things in or out of the cellendocytosisthe process where the cell surrounds sumthing and brings it into the cell because it is to big to travel through one of the channels

cell wall allows certain things to enter and exit the cellthe light and dark reactionsphotosynthesis
they use translation transcription and replication
when a substance tries to move into a cell the cell mebrane is selective in what it alows the cell membrane is selectively permeable meaning it only allows what it wants into and out of the cell also substances try to connect with different protiens on the cell membrane if they are not the right substances and protiens they will not be allowed through the barrier
osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell active transport is when energy is used to move the substances across the cell membranepassive transport is when energy is not used to move the substances across the cell membrane

osmosis when water is diffused across a membrane from more concentrated to less concentrateddiffusion materials that are crossed over from the membraneactive transport
some cells have membrane bound organelles that seperate the different types of organelles
diffusion     substances like nutrients can move across the cell membrane through diffusion which allows them through little poresosmosis     substances mainly water moves through the cell through osmosis through little pores alsoactive transport     active transport allows larger substances to move through the cell membrane when they cant pass through the pores in active transport energy helps move substances through the actual membrane
active transport is when the movement is used with the need of energypasive transport is when the movement is used without energythe sodium potassium pump is a type of movement that requires energy
osmosis is when water moves across the membraneactive transport is when energy is needed to move the substance across the membranepassive transport is when no energy is neededfor bigger particals a protein is usedthe cell can also surround a partical and absorbe it it is the oppisite for removing a partical
the cell membrane mitochondria and ribosomes
telephase which separates the two membranesanaphase and interphase
to cross the cell membrane proteins help molecules across lypid heads on the outer layer and on the inner layer help to secure the cell membrane phosphate heads help to secure the membrane as well to make sure nothing comes out or in that isnt suppose to
a concentration gradient is the movement from a bound structure into another so therefor this would be one way cells control movement another way is organelles organelles all have different purposes of being in the cell some may perform the task on controling what comes in and out of a cell another way is the lysosomes because they are the digesters in the cell so this would export substances that are not needed
tails for movement such as flagella propel them slimy like substances that help glide and also thin shaped tails that help frequent movement
they use their bodys tails and the use their surrounds to help them
the cell membrane has several ways to let things in and out of the cell the cell membrane is made of up phospate heads and lipid tails these are next to each other creating a solid block for the cell things that let things in and out of the cell are a mitchochondra these lets things transport in and out of the cell some things are so microscopic that they can go through the cell wall and back without being noticed some have to be checked for safety by the cell membrane to make sure everything inside of the cell is save even though these methods are used some things are very small and can fit through the cell membrane and go into the cell without even  being noticed this is where different things come in and help out the cell

1 the password or the handshake method this shows what can come in and what cant come in during the cell cycle process2 the cell membrane is what seperates the good and the bad so anything trying to enter through the cell wall is what is meant to be kept out 3 when something tries to get into the cell membrane the cells regulate the flow of all substances keeping anything that has to stay out out
cells make protein channels that allow certain things to move across  the cell membrane they allow substances to move in and out of the cell they also have the cytoplasm which can control how things move around the inside of the cell lastly things diffuse in the cell where particles come in and out because there is low concertration in one area and that is where they want to move so it isnt as crowded this causes thing to constantly move across the cell
ther are many differnet types of cells nerve cells it can tell when you are nervous and you could be nervous about something else brian cells you have them to think things through and you need them
the substances will first be checked and sorted according to bad and good then the cell membrane will allow it to pass through and will seperate from there by then the substances will be put to work to form more cell membranes

one of the three processes is diffusionanother one of the processes is facilitated diffusionthe final one is osmosisin diffusion particles move through th holes in the cell membranein facilitated diffusion an organelle helps particles that are to large to fit through the holes get in or outin osmosis the cell membrane forms a bubble around the particle and either pulls it in or pushes it out
three types of movement a cell may use to get substances across the cell membrane are facilitated diffusion in which channels help substances get across the membrane some cells use their psuedopods to absorb substances and others use diffusion in which the substance goes from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure
cytoplasm plasma throughout the cell which organelles can move lysosomes carry proteins from mitochondria to nuclues
cell wall stops things from entering  things that are too large cannot enter the cell
osmosis is the movement of water out of the cell membrane diffusion is the movement of substances into the cell through the cell membrane some cells have special vacuole sacs that are released out through the cell membrane the sacs contain the cells waste in it
first they go through miosis and do it that waysecond they go through mitosis and do it that waythird they build a cell wall to protect it

the cell can use osmosis to help regulate the amount of water going in and out of the cell next the cell can send foreign substances out of the cell such as bacteria then there are some parts of the membrane where certain things will only fit such as food
3 process used by cells to control the movement of cells are      1 they use parts of the body     2 they fly really fast     3 theyre like superman
endocytosis  moving into a cell exocytosis  moving out of a cell diffusion  using wtaer to transer
the cell membrane is used to control what enters and leaves the cellthe cell wall is used to keep things out of the cell that arent supposed to be in therethe nucleus controls the whole cell and it sends signals to the cell wall or membrane to keep things out
one way is that the cell uses movement is it uses its flagellum
cells use transport proteins to move substances acrosss the plasma membrane the substance moves through the protein and the plasma membrane     cells use diffusion to let some substances move through the plasma membrane     cells use active transport to transport substances through the plasma membrane
flagellas use theyre whiplike structure at the ventral side of theyre body to manover through the cell
substances can enter a cell by going through the phosolipid bilayer which is made of lipids if a substance is large it will go through a channel protein the channel proteins have receptor cells that allow a certain substance to enter
to control the movement of the substances the ribosomes golgi apparatus and lysosomes control it
three processes used by cells to control movement of substances is circulation the amount and space the cells are continualy rotated by the heart pumping blood so they can move things in and out of where they are supposed to be second red blood cells carry oxygen and some waste out of the body the cell has to know how much it can handle so it wont implode last the space cells must control how many there are of them so they will not run out of space to travel if they run out of space the cells will not be able to carry out its normal functions of carrying out waste carrying oxygen or bring in nuturients needed for the body to maintain homeostatsis

lock and key only proteins that can fit into the lock are able to get into the cellthey have protector protiens that only allow certain substances in one of them glycoprotein has a protector like a bouncer that blocks some of substances from entering and another one receptor protein only lets in ionsand transfer proteins are ones that if they are small enough they can get through they also have substances inside the cell that fight off the bad substances that come in
the cell uses a golgi apparatus to ship and move proteins across the cell ribosomes carry proteinsthe cell uses a endoplasmic reticulum to move the substances throughout the cell
prophase metaphase and anaphase
cytoplasm provides a liquid enviornment to make the transportation of substance in and out of the cell easiercell membrane has small holes in it like pores that limits different substances from entering the cellnucleus controls the instructions for each part of the cellso it gives the cell membrane basic instructions for what may come in and go out of the cell
one process that the cell membrane does is mitoisis this is when the cell starts to make a copy of itself another is when miosis this is when the cells nucleus parts into 2 and starts to divide the final one is cell division this is when the cell divides and now there are 2 cells
1 cells use fiber like hairs to touch the substances and pass them along2 substances can pass straight through them to get to an organ3 substances can combine to the outer membrane of a cell
osmosis water on the surface continues to move into and out of the cell at a stable rateexocytosis things from inside the cell exit the cell through the cell membraneendocytosis things from outside of the cell move into the cell through the cell membrane
figila a whip like structure cilia and virgialina
endocytosis is a process where things are engulfed and brung into the cell exocytosis is a prossed where things are taked out of the cell active movement moved things around the cell using energy
the plasma membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell the cell wall surrounds the cell and the er controls what goes on in the cell
they use active transport to control the intake and outake of water and sugars
cells have many different parts that help them control substances across the cell membrane like transport proteins decide what goes in
the cells use energy and they also use active transport
diffusion osmosis and absorption
cytoplasm helps slow the movement
prophase anaphase and telophase
anaphase where the cells are joinedtelophasewhere the 2 sister cells joinprophasewhere the cells slit apart
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are  diffusion equillibrium and transfusiondiffusion is the net movement of particles across the membrane  equillibrium is when the cell is in equal in all parts  transfusion is when everything is moving across the cell
1cells contain the nucelus which controls how the cell functions 2controls have the cell moves                                                3conrtols how the cell gets food
metaphaseinterphasetelophase
facilitated diffusion is a process used to get materials inside of the cell
1 transit rna and dna 2 reactants3 cells protein
the golgi body helps move substances across the cell membrane along with the endoplasmic retuclum and the proteins
1 trna transports rna strands across the cell to help it get to the dna strands2 golgi apparatus sorts and stransports proteins for the cells use3 other organelles
cells use osmosis to carry water from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membranecells use diffusion to carry materials such as carbon dioxide from a high concentration to a low concentrationcells use facilitated diffusion to carry bigger materials such as glucose across the cell membrane
the cell membrane controls the movement of matter in and out of the nucleus throughactive transport there is less matter outside of the cell and more is addedpassive transport there is less matter inside the cell and more is addedequilibriumwhere the inside of the cell and the inside are equal
osmosis diffusion and moiesis
there are three main types of movement but i personly dont know them
of these three processes one is using pores on the membrane itself to transfer proteins and other things another way cells move substances throught its membrane is osmosis by how some items can simply pass through the membrane without using the pores such as water
polar  nonpolar tails transport proteinnonpolar tails repel water
1 they use the blood system2 mrna3
the cell membrane keeps them in there the cytoplasm helps because its what they are in and the organelles themself
cells use miosis which is when the cell divides they also use osmosis which fights off bacteria and viruses another proccess they use is meiosis
active transport uses energy to move things across the membrane
there are several proesses used to stop the movement of substances across the cell surface the first process used is the process of liquidation this uses the water on top of the cells movement to act as a barrier to stop things getting into the cell second is the cell wall this also blocks out large substances from getting into the cell and damaging it lastly is defences on the inside of the cell that capture and expel bad substances from the cell
nucleous nucleolous and cell wall
1 photosynthesis helps food generate within a cell2 mrna helps cell3 evolution helps cell
cell wall  controls what enters and leaves the cellosmosis  is the diffusion across a semipermeable membramediffusion 
cells have a slectivly permiable membrane that blocks some unwanted substances and lets the good in they also have a cell membrane that protects the cells organelles from substances
they diffuse liquids from inside to the outside they use sugars to trasport things around and they have organelles that can transport things around the cell
three processes used by the cells to control the movement of substances across the cell mebrane is called flagelum ribosome and golgiapperatus
there is mitisis and other ways that stuff if passed along
the ribosomes transport them through the cytoplasm
the cell opens its self up digests the materal it has taken in and shots the waste material out of the other end
translationtranscriptionmutation
cells control movement of substances across the cell membrane by having gates that decide weather the substance is wanted or not and lets it in if its wanted or blocks it out if its unwanted the cells
one way of moving sustances is osmosis osmosis is the movement of water through a semiperiable membrane osmosis takes no effort and disposes of excess water and keeps homeostasis another form of moving substances is passive diffusion which is making the enviornment inside and outside the cell equal this takes no effort and can move more than just water but other soultions as well lastly another way to move a substance is facilitated diffusion which is moving a substaince against the concentraition gradient this method of moving substances takes effort and is diposed of through a special protein
the cell membrane is what controules the body it tells the body what to do and what to say
one is the nucleus to send messages to different things to tell them where to go two is the nucluic envolope to let certian things in and out three is certian stops or codes the oranalle catches on to to tell it were to stop
translationusing water to move across a cell

three processed used by cells are fagella which helps the organism move throughout the membrane the fagella helps the organism patroll the cell in case a disease or something came into it
the cell wall protects the cell from things getting in or out that are bad or could harm the cell in plantsthe cell membrane also keeps things from entering or exiting the cell in animals the nucleus also controls everything the cell does
cells use the cell membrane the nucliotides and the cytoplasm

cells may use vacoules passive transtport and active transport
one process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be that there is a cell membrane which is semipermeable semipermeable means that only certain things can get into the cell this type of membrane controls the movement of substances across the cell because certain things cannot get into and then move around in the cell another process used by cells would be information transfer where organelles in the cell transport dna and rna throughout the cells system a third process used by cells is when the lysosome come around and sort of clean up dead organells and recycle them this affects the cell because then certain organelles are dead and can no longer help the cell or move around in it

the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are crossing over cleavage and cell division
respiartion mobement of oxygen into the celltranspiration movement of moisture into and out of the cellcytokinesis movement of materials through the cell membrane
endocytosis is when the cells membrane wraps around a substance outside of the cell and part of the membrane disolves letting the substance inside the cell exocytosis is when a substance inside a cell gets wrapped inside the cells membrane part of the membrane disolves letting the substance out of the cell
they multiply
to control the movement across the cell membrane cells can use a variety of functions to regulate subsatnces across the membrane  they can use enzymes which act like catalyst they can also use functions of some cells to control where substances are put in the membrane
cell wall it protects them from going out of the cell

osmosis diffusion and facilitated diffusion are the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane in osmosis it is the movement from higher concentration to lower concentration across a membrane the soutes are being dissolved in to the solvent and can readily do so on their own with this there are three types of solutions hypotonic hypertonic and isotonic in facilitated diffusion it is movement from higher to lower concntration across the membrane as well with tings that can not readily pass through on their own these then use the help of thing such as sodium potassium pumps and ion channels in diffusion it is also the movement from higher to lower concentration these things do not need assitance passing through and can readily do this own their own unitl they reach equilibrium in which all things are balanced and even
they control the energy flow
the cell membrane controls what comes into the cell and what comes out the cell also breaks things down and the ribosomes helps control the cell membrane
osmosis move water through a cell membranemitosis moves materials needed to servivemrna sends messages to the nucleus
miosismitosis cell respiration
endocytosis is when something moves into the cell exocytosis is when something moves out of the cell and mitosis when the cell seperates and divides
it goes in it comes out our it stayes in
the use of ribosomesthe endoplasmic reticulum pathway can help move substancesthe golgi apparatice can also help move substances
the cell slowly pushes things to get out of the cell against the membrane on the inner area  then the thing that needs to get out is forced between the membrane then it is pushed out
passive
they have cytoplasm in which they use to move substances across the membrane
the three processes that control movement are er which carries
one of this processes is diffusion diffusion makes cells from a high consintration to a low consintration
the three process used by cells to control the movement of substance across the cell membranecell wall is one of the substances another one the substance are the nucleus the final substance is the cell membran
transporting proteins through the cell membrane and diffusion
blood flow could be a major part of this
one is using a flagellum to help movement
there are different proteins in a cell membrancethe nucleus is in the cell membraneeukaryotes is one of the movment substances that control the cell membrane
in order to control movement of substances cells use cell to cell contact hormonal signals and membrane proteins cell to cell is simply what it sounds like it is a process that results in the contact of two cells that allows substance movement in hormonal signals hormones transmit different signals that allow substances to move through the membrane the function of the membrane protein is to control what enters the cell and this allows substances to enter the cell and move through the membrane
transcription dna becomes rna in a celltranslation mrna leaves a celltranformation trma carries the information
three processes are diffusion osmosis and absorption
they can use obsorbtion of water their spindels or respiration
the flagumelle is a tail like whipe thats at the end of the cell  it moves around making the cell move  the chellie are hair like steams that move like paddles making the cell move
1 the cell membrane contains all of the organelles within the cell  it keeps everything in tact2 the liquidlike substance within the cell controls the movement of the organelles by keeping everything in place but allowing them to move about easily3 other organelles read what is coming in and going out of the cell  they determine whether the substance is harmful or not and act accordingly

cell can control what comes in by endocytitis and things that come out by exdocystis and metsis
three proceses used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell memberane are diffusion endocytosis and exocytosis duffusion is when the cell splits apart into more cells endocytosis is when the the the cell need the surrounding layer to form and when something has to reenter the cell for exocytisis the cell already has the surrounding layer for the substances to move across it the cell wont let anything else come in
each cell is composed of a membrane with many proteins that allows substances to move across through the portein another process is osmosis the eell must balance its inside and outside so it must move water and other substances across its membrane to make everythign equal the cell diffuses other substances through the membrane without using the proteins
cells use membrane pumps diffusion and osmosis to control movement across the cells membrane membrane pumps can help move the substances with or against their concentration gradiant to get them where they need to be diffusion helps control what substances move through the cell membrane by trying to reach equilibrium osmosis controls water movement across the cell membrane
1 osmosis when water goes from a high concentration to a low concentration 2 they go through diffusion 3 the cell membrane helps filter things from coming in and out
mitosis cell division and photosynthesis
1 flagella moves the cells across cell membranes2 unrigid body structures3 mrna

1 filters and protects
they use the faglleum to move around the cell membrane
the cell uses osmosis to slowly take in the nutrients that it needs cells also use diffusion
wings mitochandria flagelum
1 they use flagelm2 they move protiens3
cells control the movement of substances across their cell membrane by a selectively permeable membrane the membrane can either surround a substance and bring it into the cell or it can open up part of its cell membrane
three processe that are used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane would be1 the cell wall2 the mitochondia3 the cytoplasm
walks across the cell sliding across the cell and runs across the cell
active transportpassive transportprotein chanels
the cell will leave and reenter the membrane
the lysosome gets rid of unwanted particles in the cellthe nucleus controls the cellthe cell membrane is in control of what leaves and enters the cell
one way is that they carry them transfer themand mutate them
cells make proteins to keep substances off the cell membrane they create integral and peripheral proteins with the help of ribosomes vesicles transport things to and from the membrane by traveling through the cell lysosomes can transport bad substances from the membrane and flush them out of the cell
one thing controlled by the cell is the golgi apparatus it controlls what happens to the cells if the go in or out also it controls what comes in such as germs they try to block those as much as possible
the fat moves throught the cell wall and the same for everything else
selective permiability
one type of process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is facilitated diffusion this method requires the use of energy to get larger molecules that cannot regularly diffuse across the cell membrane another method used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis osmosis is the regular diffusion of water or other small particles across the cell membrane without the use of energy cells i dont believe can control the movement of substances here laslty is diffusion diffusion is the movement of particles again that are still small enough as if it was osmosis but it moves differently these particles move from lowconcentrated areas to highconcentrated areas of particles
osmosishomeiostasis
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the krebs cycle calvin cylce and short cycle
1 waste is dispelled through the cell membrane to eliminate it from the cell2 water is absorbed and transfered througout the cell when it is needed3 food is transfered throughout the cell to supply vital nutrients to the cells organelles
one type of process a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane is facilitated diffusion which is a type of passive transport another example is osmosis this too is a type of passive transport a third example of a process in which a substance is moved across the cell membrane is the sodiumpotassium pump  the sodiumpotassium pump transfers 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions into the cell  the sodiumpotassium pump is an example of active transport  one other example is diffusion which is a type of passive transport
diffusionosmosisproteen chanals
1 passive diffusion big partacles are pushed through marker proteins to get into the cell2 active diffussion particles that need to leave and go the opposite way the cell requires energy3 osmosis particles that freely move back and forth the membrane to reach equalibrium
active transport is where the cell moves substances across the membrane with the help of the cells energypassive transport is where the cell moves substances across the membrane without using any of the cells energyfacilitated diffusion is where the substance inside the cell is too large or unable to pass through the membrane on its own  therefore transport proteins help the substance pass through the membrane
through the blood stream to make it easier
diffusionstopping rolling
passive
the cell membrane is semipermialbe so it will only allow certain things into or out of the cell
there arew parts that only let water though also the membraine can choose  to leave things in or make them leave the membrain blocksa unwamted things like waste
there is osmosis which is the movement of water through semipermiable cell membrane there is passive transport which is the movement of things through the cell membrane without the use of energy lastly there is active transport which is the movement of things through the cell membrane with the use of energy
the three processes by cells include transfusion that helps move across to cells intechange which cells help the substances during their feature to be able to move across the membrane diffusion which helps the substances to move across the membrane faster and without interruption
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are messenger rna transfer rna and ribosomal rna mrna is the rna that uses messenges that are sent from one part of the body to the cell membrane in order to tell the membrane what it is that is needed to be done in the body trna is the rna that is used to transfer greatly needed data to the cell membrane however ribosomal rna is used to transfer the needed amount of ribosomes to the cell membrane for more protection for the cell
osmosis the duffusion of particles across a permeable mambrane
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be the chloroplast ribosomes and mitochondria chloroplast controls the movement of substances because it is the only thing besides the ribosomes that float freely in the cell the mitochondria controls everything in the cell it is the brain of the cell it can make anything move anywhere it wants to
sodiumpotassium pump sloped gradient and vesicles
one process widened up the protein channels letting bigger proteins get in and out of the cell protein channels help  proteins get across the cell quicker and easier another process helps proteins get into the cell telling them where to go
they use energy to push the organic nutrients to different parts of the cellthe cell membrane controls what moves in amd out of a celllysosomal properties such as exporting and importing nutreints to and from the cell membrane
one process is diffusion this is when substances move across the membrane from high concentration to low concentration another process is osmosis this is when water moves across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentrationthe third process is
osmosis active diffusion and something else that i cant remember
one process is called diffusion which is when liquid matter slowly phases through a membrane another process is cellular respiration which is when the cell is in need of oxygen and the last is called protein sythesis which is when the cell creates atp
cells control their movement by recieving infomation from the nuclei

diffusion is used to move substances to an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration  diffusion does not require energy because it goes along with the gradient  osmosis is used to move water molecules to an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration  osmosis does not require energy because it goes along with the gradient  active transport is used to move substances to an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration  active trasport requires energy because it goes against the gradient
the mitochondrian move the waste in and out of the cell  the mrna information to the cell  the trna makes the information

communication cell divisionreproduction
one process is diffusion  diffusion allows materials to flow from where there are higher concentrations of that substance to where there are lower concentrations of that same substanceanother process is active transport  it allows a cell to control exactly which materials enter or leave the cell but it also expends energyanother process is the use of protein channels  these allow only one specific type of molecule to enter of leave through that  channel  these distributed across the cell membrane allow the cell to control what enters or leaves
they can use a flangelum
cellular respiration photosynthesis cellular reproduction
the cell wall stops the other cells from moving in and out of the membrane it makes sure no hurt full cells can get in
the process used by the cell is by staying hard and not letting anything through that it is not suppose to
cells use osmosis  this is the diffusion of water from higher concentration to lower concentration passive transport is used also  this is where chemicals and particals pass through the cell membrane without using energyactive transport is the last one that is used  this is where larger particles are moved in and out of the cell through the membrane  this process uses energy
1cells allow different things to enter and leave the cell membrane2
the three processes used by a cell to control movement are flagellum cilia and pores on the outsides of the cell
they use osmosis cytoplasm and nucleus to control this
i dont know their organelles control the movement
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is cell division mitosis and meiosis cell division basically includes the other two processes mitosis and meiosis both are processes in which divide the cell in half or into four different cells they move all the substances within that cell to each other cell evenly
one of the tree processes that cells use to control the movement of substances acroos the cell membrane are
cell regulators
the cell uses flagella to move and moves ad stuff
cells use osmosis which is a simple diffusion used with water and no energy is needed facilitated diffusion which also requires no energy cells also use active transport when energy is needed to move against the concentration gradient
one is osmosis were water is able to move in and out of the celltwo oxygen defusion
one process used by cells to control the movement are the pores they let things in and out another process is

the cells help to keep movement in the brain and they keep the body clean
they use flagella to move themselves around they use something sticky to stay on one thing or another and to pull themselfs from place to place they use other organisms to stay on and they move when the organism moves
osmois diffusiondiffision
diffusion osmois and something else
osmosis lets water go into and out of cell the cell wall is selective on what substances it lets in the cell
mrna transfers different objects across it it will move proteins around mrna also sends of the nucleuss message through the cell membrane to different parts of the cell in between the 2 lipid layers there is a transport object that helps move things in and out of the cell
cells use osmosisuses energy to get materials across wateractive transport when a cell uses energy to move materials across the membranepassive transport when the cell dosent use energy to move objects across the membrane
cells can use osmosis to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane osmosis is when water difuses through a barrier to the other side of it diffusion also can be used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane diffusion is when a substance moves from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration transcription can be used as well to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane transcription is when a protein is translated and then moved across the cell membrane
active transportosmosis
1 some cells have a flagllum that can make them move around
the cell is surrounded inside by the cytoplasm that holds all of the organelles together the second way is to travel through all the organelles one at a time the final way is when the substance is entering or leaving the cell through the plasma membrane
the first type of movement that the cell membrane uses to control the movement of substances is passive transport this means that the substance being transported will be on the higher side of the concentration gradient and be pushed across the membrane so that both sides will be at a state of equilibrium the second type is active transport this means the substance will be pushed against the membrane from being in a less dense to more dense side this takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzymethe third type is osmosis the cell will have to take in water to maintain its functions work properly and the substances may be in the water that the cell takes in allowing the substance to cross the cell membrane
cells have a selectively permeanble membrane meaning that they only let certain things into them  this happens in two ways osmosis and diffusion  osmosis is the crossing of water through the cell membrane and diffusion is the crossing of other things  one way that a cell allows things into it is active transport  when a cell has to use active transport it has to do something to let the object or liquid into the cell  it has to use channel proteins to allow it in  another way that cells let things cross through the membrane is through passive transport  passive transport is more layed back and happens easier than active transport
i dont think that that we even did this but ill try ummm one is the nucleous the second would be traspertation the third one would be cell wall
cells move by using their bodys shape to move they are either spiral shaped rod shaped or flat spiral cells spin around rods roll around and flat cells hitch rides on moving substances
cells use processes of all sorts they have a process which they let things in and out of the cell and they have processes of making cells

meiosisrespirationcell reproduction
first of all cells have a selectively permeable membrane  that means that they control what enters and exits  they also have active and passive transports where substances can also move across the cell membrane  one last type of process is osmsois or the act of moving water across a cell membrane  each of the previously listed processes preform the same job and that is controlling the movement of any kinds of substances across the cells membrane
cells use meiosis diffusion and mitosis control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
carrying out of the cellmaking sure the things entering the cell are good for the cellthe blood moving the materials across the cell
osmosis controls the water movement across the cell membrane the cell membrane allows for substances that the cell needs in and gets rid of the waste and unwanted material
the action of a cell is controlled by the shape of it so with that being said one of the ways would be that the shape if the cell will help it move throughout the cell membrane another way would be that this cell is like a train it has many stops but they all go to the same destination within the cell things go throughout many different places to get where they need to be where theyre actually traveling to

one of the processes used is cell reprouduction cell reproduction is when the cell is reproducing the same kind of dna or plant another process is  cell walls the cell wallsa are used to help control the movement  the third of the procexsses are the cell membrane the cell membrane is used to stop the flow of how the  cells move
tail speedand movement
the process of substances moving from cell to cell is called osmosis this is when substances move from the outside of a cell to the inside of the cell another process included in cell substance movement is called diffusion the process of diffusion takes place when the percentage of a substance is higher on the outside of the cell than on the inside
cell membrane controles what enters and leaves a cell the golgi apparatis makes the ribosomes thatand the nucleus codes all the protiens
diffusion  the flow of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration using no energyfacilitated diffusion  the flow of particles from an area of low concentration to an area of higher concentration using energyosmosis  the diffusion of water using no energy
osmosis is used to diffuse molecules across the cells permiable membrane also use protein carriers to determine what can move across the membrane
respirationcellular comunication
the cells use dynamic equlimbrium to let cells in and outthey scan each substance and see if its good or bad or harmful or usefulland the white blood cells make sure that no harmfull substances try to get in
respiration helps the cell move from one part of the cell to another part of the cellfermitilization helps the cell move threw the breaking down of organizim to be used threw the whole part of the cellreproduction effects the cell by reproducing the part of the cell threw the whole thing it makes new organism that produce more
catalysts are used enzymes are also used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
flagella cell membranecell walls
mitosis meosis cellular respiration
one type of process used by cells is diffusionanother is active transportanother way of moving substances is by the giogli apparatus
three processes used by cells to control the movement of subtances across the cell membrane would be cell transport respiration and osmosis
diffusion is when an object diffuses over the membrane
cells have a membrane that allows only certain things to pass through the membrane only allows small things to pass it cant pass through if its too big
the first process is cell diffussion when a cell links on to anotherthe secound process is when the cell that are two small or two big cant not enterthe third process is when the equalizes the level of starch in the cell
respiration translation and transcription are three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
1 pushing them2 telling them3 making them
photosythesis meiosis netaphase
since a cells membrane is semipermiable there are multiple ways for substances to enter the cell the first is osmosis osmosis allows water to enter or leave the cell depending on the need the second is diffusion diffusion takes all substances other than water across the membrane moving from area of high concentration to areas of low concentration the third way is through facilitated diffusion the cell pulls substances across the membrane that would otherwise be to large
cell wall
osmosisdiffusionmitosis
diffusion is part of the movement of substances across the cell membrane
cellsenergy
the cells have to go through three processes to get to the cell membrane  the first process is cell reproduction the cell must reproduce itself  the second process is cell transportation so it can travel to the membrane finally the third process is cell diffusion the cell has to diffuse itself to finally reach the membrane
cells divide and multiple in meiosis and mitosis replicating thier genetics and the new cells do the job they are specialized for and those cells divide and reproduce to keep the body going and keep repeating the process of cellular division and replication so that these new cells can keep performing these jobs and keep the body and its functions going
they choose what enters the body

golgi apparatusmoves and transports thingsindoplasmic reticulumcarries thingslysosomemoves things to the right stop
flagellum is one process that cells use for movement they also use ribsomes to move one other process is er
it uses osmosis which defined is the process of transfering water across a cell membrane facilated diffusion is when substances are moved from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration there is also diffusion that is when substances are moved from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
cells use proteins to allow substances in and out of a semipermeable membrane physical tubes may be constructed to allow certain materials through finally certain substances are permentantly allowed entrance by certain ways into the cell
cells divede and become two the cells separate
mutation crossing over independent reproduction
ribosomes is a process to make proteincytoplasm is the gel inside of a cellvacuoles are the processes in the cell that stores things
diffusion is when materials move from a high concentration to a low consentration  facilitated diffusioj is when materials move from a low consentrated area to a high consentrated area  active transport is when the cell uses its substances to move other substances across the cell membrane
by having there cell membrane which covers their nucleusmany cells may have their flagellumand helps them move around
osmosis
one is the flangella eaither one or many to help it propel its selfanother is a holdfast this keeps it from moving so it can stay in one place for example some types of alge another type is connecting to eachother in the case of some green alge it flotes at the water surface slowly moving with the tide the more that is connected the more food they get because they can take in more
one process that controls the movement of the cell is water air and earth
osmosis the movement of water through a permeable membrane based on the concentration gradient water will move from higher concentration to lower concentrationfacilitated diffussion like osmosis but uses channel proteins to help guide in and out of the cell based on concentration gradientactive transport uses atp concentration gradient does not dictate which way the substance can go
a fox runs after there food snakes us there tongus to eat there pray  and a bird gets worms to feed to here babeys every day
the cell uses organelles to move substasnces across the cell membrane like chloroplast ribosomes and vacules
homeostasis
it carry energy
the cells use carrier proteins to transfer things across the membrane they use endocytosis to move a substance that is to big in they also use exocytosis to move cells out that are too large
1 active transport energy is used by proteins to move something across the cell membrane2 passive transport no enery is required a protein is inserted into the cell membrane and substances pass through it3 endosymbiosis the cell membrane engulfs a substance and brings it into the cell
one processs is called transcription in tramscription the trna acts as a taxi and picks up material needed for the other parts of rnaanother process is diffusion this controls what moves through the membrane
1 they use many different types of substances2 they
flagella and cilia
mitosismeoisiscell cycle
cell respiration
one process is called dna replication and it takes dna and it clones it taking it through the body to special protiens throughout the body and cloneing it another process is called mitosis and that is the creation of new cells another one is meiosis which is the creation of new sex cells
there is only one way to use movement to control cell membrane 
cells may use their membrane cytoplasm and tail to think and move the way they want
flagellumis a whippeed like srusture
osmosis diffusion transduction
the substances slow stuff down
ceilia helps move cells acrossed the cell membreane
diffusionmitosisosmosis
theres is one like a highway called mitocondriaanother which are the ribosomesanother which is the messenger
photosynthesis osmoises  diffusion
methaphase prophase cytophase
the three processes include flagellum which is a whiplike structure that moves the cell around the others i cant remember
cell division  cell mutation  cell replication
diffusion does not use energy this move molecues from a high concentration to a low concentrationactive transport helps move molecules across the membrane using energy
endocytosis moves large substances into the cell using vesicles exocytosis moves large substances out of the cell using vesicles the sodiumpotassium pump uses an ion channel to keep the right balance of sodium and potassium in the cell it does this by sending potassuim into the cell and soduim out of the cell
one process is that the cell may have protein channels that only let a certain amount of substances in to the cell at any given time another process is that a substances will use diffusion and spread the substances over the membrane and only let certain one in one other process is that the can use diffusion to only let certain ones is because particles will want to go from a smaller space to a larger space not the other way around
the cells use the cytoplasm to carrie food and proteins to different parts of the cell the cell also makes organells that like mrna to go around the cell to make more protiens and also atp that goes to ribissomes to make proteins
mutation
cells control the blood flowcells help clean out and unclog places that are cloggedcells help make the immune system stronger so the person can get healthier quicker from being sick
cell wall chloraplast nucleus
binary fissionreproduction
they have a cell wall that allows them do decide what organisims my enter teh cell and whick ones do not
cells use osmosis to move water across a permeable membrane
each cell has a lipid bilayer which allows water in because it is polar and other subtances it keeps out another example is the cell wall of a plant cell which gives the call structure but also gives protction a cell will also go through osmosis which is the process of bringing in water to the cell quickly if nessicary a cell can use active transport to bring in nutrients that it normally would not use but at the time it needs
they move aros from one cell to another
by the flagellen and some use air to move around and there are some that just float arouund
the cells move in a process called chromosome also cell divison prophase
active transport is used to move substtances across the membrane with the use of energy from low to highpassive transport is used without energy and moves from high to low concentrationossmosis and diffusion are used with the help of water
to protectkeep its shape reproduce
the vacuole regulates cell movementthe mitochondrion controls how the substances are placed  controlledthe endoplasmic reticulum effects whate happens to the substances when they are dealt with
diffusionthe movement of substances from higher to lower concentrationosmosisthe diffusion of water through a semipermiable membranepotassiumion pumppump that helps potassium cross the cell membrane
passive transport requires no energyto make substancesactive transport requires energy to make substancesosmosis moving water
in the cells cell membrane there are polar heads and nonpolar heads the polar head has a positive charge and the nonpolar head has a negative charge this allows water to flow through the cell
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are facilitated diffusion which uses proteins to allow water and larger molecules through the membrane by diffusion osmosis regular diffusion which uses the regulation of molecules on one side of the membrane be the same as on the other to keep water and small nonpolar molecules in the cell and sometimes to get them out and finally active transport by proteins is where a protein moves on the very outside of the cell membrane grabs the molecule and moves back through the phospholipid bilayer to bring the molecule inside the cell
flagellum cell membranecytoplasm
the processes used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the ribosome and the mitochondrion
reproduction is used by cells to make more and more of them
the cell wall the cell wall keeps all the cells orgionelles in place and blockes and other substtances from enteringthe messenger cells they carrie information to the cells nucleus
one process is used by willingly letting large substances pass through the membrane through holes in the membraneanother process is used by taking the substance into a barrier reading it then letting it pass throughanother process is unwilling to the cell but the substance forces itself inside the cell membrane
cellular communication cell reproduction
cells use simple diffusion to move substances across the membrane  simple diffusion involves substances such as water located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance  for example if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell and a lower concentration outside the cell then water will pass through the cells membrane and go outside the cell     cells also use facillitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane  facillitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration  this type of diffusion requires energy     cells also have special transporting proteins in their membranes that help move large substances into and out of the cell  these types of substances would be too large to pass through the cell membrane just through diffusion
one process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membreane would be active transport another is diffusion and the last one is osmosis in active transport you go from a place of low concentration to high concentration and for the other two you go from high concentrationt to low concentration
prophase interphase and telophase
diffusion is a type of passive transport where moleules move in and out of the cell through diffusion osmosis is the movement o of water in and out of the cell in order to reach equilibrium or two isotonic solutions endocytosis is the oving of food etc into the cell for energy
the cell have to move through to carry out through the membrane
diffusionwhen the concentration of water in the cell is less than the surrounding area and water flows into the cellosmosis
one process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is called photosynthesis another is called homeostasis
sed messages to your brainso i hat case u will do what our rain tells you
the cells use the lysomes cell membranes and the cell wall if you are a plant cell  they also use their fluids or plasmas to move things around the cell  the cell membrane allows things to go in and out of the cell  the lysomes help send important things to other parts of the cell  the cell wall is used much like the cell membrane but for plants
they might use there flagella
the cell controls what enters and leaves the cell the flagellen contols when it will move and the golgi body controls what liquid enters the cell
the nucleuslysosmesglogibodies
they have a cell membrane which allows the cell to keep unwanted organisms out of the cell it also has some small openings which can only be passed through by specialized organisms finally it has structures that act as gateways and require an activation energy toll to pass through the cell membrane
they all wrap around the substance and transfer it together
going from and out of the membrane is going in to the membrane with proteint
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the ribosomes the nucleus and the proteins
plant cells use respiration to turn atp into food energy animal cells use mitosis to reproduce body celss gametes use miosis to divide and reproduce
cells are moved across the membrane by cell specialization
translationtransformationrespiration
multiplyingthere would be the multiplying of the cells reproducing more and more cells would be able to keep viruses through getting in the the cell membranethe cell wall would seperate each cell from touching each other
brainnervesnucleues
osmosis where water moves through a permeable membranediffusion where your trying to get water to be equal through out different spots of your body and cellsendocytosis and exocytosis where your taking material into the cell endocytosis and where you are taking material out of your cell exocytosis when needed
the first is dna the next is rna then cell membrane
they can control what goes in and out of the cell by using proteins that only allow certain things in they also use their phosphate bilayer to protect large things from going in the cell
1 having organelles      they have specific organelles that perform specific fuctions          to keep things organized and moving throughout the cell2 cell mrna      cell mrna performs many tasks leaving the nucleus with          messages that tell the rest of the cell what to do3cell respiration      cell respiration helps to get rid of harmful substances and            bring in important materials that the cell needs in order to            survive
crossing overmutation
one type is diffusion this is where the cell absorbs nutrients through the cell wall transcription is another transcription is where the cell allows water to pass through the cell
1 they have special receptors that only allow certain things to come into the cell 2 most cells contain a nucleus which is like a brain that controls what needs to be done the nucleus also controls the er which exports protiens so only the bad stuff gets transported out of the cell 3 cells have special enzymes that allow them to take in material that may be too big to fit into a receptor this allows them to take in important things that would not be allowed in otherwise
absorption is when a substance is absorbed through the cell membrane into the cytoplasmribosomes can carry substances through the cell membrancethe cell membrane can envelope substances by cellular respiration thus bringing them into the cell
1 the cell membrane lets things in and out2flagella3trna
the nucleus is one of the main parts in a cell
carries things in and out keeps things that arnt needed outcirculates
1prophase2metaphase3anaphase4telephase5interphase spends most of its life time in this phase till reproduction
protiens moving around make the cell to move and the cell to function properly chloroplast helps things move swiftly around the cell to help keep the flow of everything and water going in and out of the cell to keep the cell hydrated
three processes are anaphase metaphaseand prophase these processes each control the movement of substances in different ways they stop what comes in and out of the cell control what goes across the cell and help determine when to break down the things inside the cell

membrane membrane protein and through endocytosis
the three processes to control the movemnet is rrna mrna and trna
1  they use osmosis which is the movement of water around the membrane2  they use the flagella which act like oars to move the cell3  cells also use the cytoskeleton to control some of the movement
1 the cell membrane is semipermiable so it only allows certain substances into the cell2 there are protiens within the cell membrane which allows substances to enter or exit the cell
the cell alows things to come in and out the cell
the cell brings in nutreints through the cell membrane then the nutrients move across the golgi bodies and out the other side
energy is stored and than released when necessary to obtain and give off energy for movement
spores open up and force movement out of the membrane
the three processes used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cells are diffusion osmosis and something else osmosis is the diffusion of water from high to low
they send signalsthey control your body movementthey make sure your body is working properly
the cells control center the nucleus tells the cell where things need to go the vacule controls what enters and leaves the cell

movement across the cell membrane is controlled through 
osmosis diffusion of water across a cell membrane
the cell membrane uses diffusion osmosis and chemiosis to move substances across the cell membrane
interphasemetaphase prophase
sodiumpotassium pump ion channel and lipid bilayer
osmosis water is transfered through thte cell from less concentrated to more concentrated diffusion many substances are transfered to and from the cell through the cell membranesymbiosis
of these three processes one is using pores on the membrane itself to transfer protiens another way is through absorbing the substances threw the membrane into the cell the last way is that the membrane allows the substance to enter the cell
