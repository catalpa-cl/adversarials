i met mr leonard when i started middle school he was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving along from one classroom to the next move along people move along hed advise the shuffling crowd and everyone complied 
i distinguished myself from the masses by being one of a select few in the remedial reading program twice a week i left english class early for the learning center in the basement where i worked with a tutor on my first trip mr leonard confronted me in the stairwell 
hey my friend where do you think youre going he asked arms folded across his chest
learning center i muttered showing him my hall pass
why he asked from behind a hard stare
why i answered automatically i cant read 
his gaze softened fair enough on your way then work hard 
for the next few weeks that was the extent of our conversations hed meet me in the stairwell id show him my pass then one day he surprised me by asking what i did after school 
nothing i answered just some homework 
meet me in the gym 230 since this gave me a legitimate reason to delay my daily homework battles i agreed 
when i arrived the gym was crowded with kids warming up for intramurals mr leonard was seated in a corner watching he waved me over then pointed at the kids chasing basketballs none of this appeals to you he asked 
i shook my head when youre the last guy chosen for teams in gym class you dont seek out more of that treatment after school 
follow me he directed and obediently i followed we left the building and went to the track spread along the inside lane were hurdles mr leonard pointed at the closest one
know what that thing is called he asked 
a hurdle i answered
know what to do with it he questioned 
you jump it i replied
well he responded on your way then 
it never occurred to me to refuseperhaps id been conditioned by hearing those words every day i got into a slow jog and awkwardly hopped over each barrier for a whole lap
not a bad first effort commented mr leonard as i staggered in 
that was terrible i gasped
youll do better next time he responded bring sneakers and shorts tomorrow
right i panted 
mr leonard began walking back toward the school then turned and asked say whats your name
paul it didnt occur to me until later that this was an odd question for someone who had checked my hall pass twice a week 
and so it began monday through friday rain or shine i was out on the track with mr leonard shouting from the side open your stride pump your arms lean     now  i improved steadily until one day i found myself standing before the high school track coach 
howd you get so fast son he asked 
well ive been training i replied someones helping me
mr leonard grabowski 
i nodded 
the coach smiled and asked me to work out with the high school team then he scribbled on a scrap of paper and handed it me it was a url for a track and field website 
visit this site do a search for grabowski 
the next day i told mr leonard about my conversation with the coach and asked if he thought i should work out with the team 
absolutely he replied with a grin a little competition will only help 
i pulled the printout id downloaded the night before from my pocket why didnt you tell me about this 
he looked at me quizzically then smiled sadly at the image on the page
i looked good back then didnt i he chuckled 
i moved beside him and pointed to the photograph you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records 
i remember he said solemnly best race of my life 
well what happened after that i pressed
mr leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground his brow furrowed his voice cracked as he spoke
i was a good athlete he said softly but not a good student  we had no learning centers in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard  his voice trailed off 
but you went to college i said
things were different back then he replied the college scouts told me that my grades didnt matter that id have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read 
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him 
 cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training

the background information about mr leonard relates to paul because they both couldnt read very good and mr leonard wants paul to to do better in life then what he did it effects paul by making him want to try hard in track and school

as paul learns more about mr leonard he is able to see just how much alike the two of them really are an example would be paul cannot read and neither can mr leonard when he was in college mr leonard was a star hurdler as a freshman paul is starting out to have potential to be a great hurdler the last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are paul can  sympathsize with mr leonard because they are both not very good at something
the effect on paul about mr leonard was that it dont matter how smart you have to play sports but its best that you still care for your school
it shows that even if you cant read just like mr leonard it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldnt read that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field so it just showed paul that he shouldnt give up just because something gets hard in life
he relates to mr leonard so feels bad for him
he starts to realize that mr leonard is trying to teach him a life lesson on never giving up because he was a good athelete and ended up not being able to run because he couldnt read he then realized he needed to learn to read and try his best to achieve his own greatness
when paul recieved the background information on mr leonard he saw a connection between them that is why later in the story they decid to start training together and since they both struggle with reading they can be better friends in understand what they are going through
mr leonard isnt a good reader and so he tells paul he broke records in college but he couldnt read that good so it helped paul understand that it is good to learn how to read and over come obsticables
in knowing mr leonards background information paul feels like the two can relate now after mr leonard tells paul about his inability to read paul states the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me this statement supports the fact that paul feels empathy for mr leonard because the two of them have experienced the same struggle in school
the background information that the reader recieves about mr leonard is that he was a track star through high school and his freshman year in college but that he didnt know how to read his grades were terrible and he flunked out of college despite being an incredible runner it didnt help him academically one of the best runners in history who broke records had more in common with paul than he could have ever imagined paragraph 45 states the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeeling of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could for him paul realizes that mr leonard also cannot read but took his time out of his day to teach paul how to excel at something that he did know how to do and knew how to do it very well paul returns this favor to the best of his ability by trying to help mr leonard learn how to read paragraph 46 says cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward the school its time to start your training
the backrground information that paul finds out about mr leonard has a good effect on him  when he finds out that mr leonard was a good athlete but did not finish college it gave paul hope  he realized why mr leonard was so interested in helping him better himself  mr leonard helped paul excel and feel like he was worth something  so paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return  so he began teaching mr leonard how to read
he is excited because he will learn how to and be good at a sport
paul thinks that if he got to know mr leonard then maybe they would have something in common with him
the effect the backround information has on paul is it shows him a whole nother side to mr leonard it showed him that they were much more alike them he origanally thought the emotion in mr leonards words were all to familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him after he learns this about mr leonard he realizes he should do something for him in return cmon mr leonard i said walking back twoard school its time to sstart your training

he lost his scholarship and flunked outno ather schools wanted a runner who couldnt readhe wasnt a good studentand that he had no learning senters in his school
the backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind  this feeling was the way he felt when he was in fromt of other students and wasnt sure of an answer or couldnt read a passage  the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me supports the my opinion that paul knows how mr leonard feels  the effect of mr leonards background information made paul choose to help mr leonard in reading just as he had helped paul overcome the obstacle of jumpin hurdles  this is shown in this passage from the story this man had given his time to help me excel at something  suddenly i realized what i could do for him
the effection the data has on paul is a lot paul thinks it is amazing that mr leonard has done so much with his sports career

mr leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college he was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip paul became an amazing athlete  who cant read as well in paragraphs 410 he gets stopped by mr leonard and then trains more and improves during paragraphs 2226 paul and mrleonard both have poor reading skills but are great athletes
the information paul finds about mr leonard on the website is surprising to him  he found out that mr leonard also had and still does trouble reading  mr leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read       paul finds this to be surprising  he feels empowered to help mr leonard to learn how to read since mr leonard has helped him learn to jump hurdles and get pass obstacles like not being able to read very well or at all
it shows paul that mr leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that paul has in life  he emotionally talks about how he had gone to college on a track and field scholarship but flunked out because he couldnt read and that really affected paul because he knew that feeling all too well paul was having to go to a learning center to read so he knew exactly what mr leonard went through
at first paul felt a little big left out because in paragraph 35 he said why didnt you tell me about this after some of the story is revealed paul became curious and pressed on in paragraph 40 well what happened after that then finally in paragraph 46 when the full story is told paul felt bad for mrleonard because the two people are very alike
the backgound information that paul had gotten effect him because mrlenard couldnt read just like him so they both help out each other to learn something new
the effect of the background information had a great effect on paul paul might have felt as though he is being trained by one of the best hurdlers he knows of paul was also appauled by the information he wanted to know why mr leonard stopped doing track and why did he want to trained paul
paul is surprised by what he finds out about mr leonard he was kind of shocked and excited about the achivements that he had made
mr leonard was a very good track runner he broke lots of records while he ran the hurdles he was a poor reader and lost all his scholarships and flunked out of college he now works as a hall monitor paul is going to help mr leonard read and mr leonard is going to help paul run track
learning about mr leonards background information gives paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer paul empathizes with mr leonard because he understands the embarrassment mr leonard feels due to his inability to read since he himself has gone through the same experience paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort mr leonard has given to help him  he shows this thankfulness with his desire to help mr leonard learn how to read

he was a good athlete but he wasnt such a good student mrleonard relied on his friends to help him get by he related to him because he was embarrased when he got called to read aloud it doesnt really effect the back ground so much
mr leonard was ashamed although he did well in his athletics he wasnt a good student  and he wanted paul to know that you cant get by easy without knowing you work he wanted paul to focus on learning but at the wsame time become a better athlete mr leonard tell paul how and what he did and college and that was depend on others to help him get by
mr leonard try to be good person and he want to go to collage but mrleonard felt embarrassment

mr leonard couldnt read either and hes trying to say that everyone has obsticals they have to overcome in life reading is one of the things mr leonard needed to overcome but he didnt overcome it while he was in college thats why he flunked out no school wanted a runner that couldnt read so he never went back
when paul found out about mr leonards background it was all to familiar to paul paul said in the story that he knew the emotions in mr leonards words to well feelings of embarrassment when called to read aloud or when he didnt know an answer everyone else did know
i think that when paul gets the background information on mr leonard he is inspired to be just like him paul says you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records this shows that paul is enthused about the fact that the person who taught him to do this is a professional in his eyes

it shows that paul will have a good coach to teach him how to do the hurdles when mr leonard is telling him to pump his arms and lean paul will know that mr leonard will know what he is talking about
paul knew nothing about mr leonard before he started having conversations with him the most paul knew about him was that mr leonard was the hall monitor and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis when the coach gave paul the url and told him to do some research on mr leonard it had a great effect on him when he did it he realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a hurdle in his life and that he meant well mr leonard did this hoping that paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that paul could overcome it while he still had a chance and the ability to do so
the information made paul want to become a better athlete and reader feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knewline 4648 this shows how paul could relate to mr leonard after he told about his past

paul felt like him and mr leonard had stuff in common not knowing to read he felt like he had to try his best and fulfill mr leonards tasks because when mr leonard was in school he had the same problems as paul and didnt make it cause he couldnt read like he did so he was going to prove some people wrong and help paul out in hurdle
he was suprised that mr leonard was a track star in college and that even though he was a teacher he flunked ou of college
when paul learns that mr leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused  then it is clear why mr leonard took interest in paul and that is because he can relate to him  paul realizes this and connects them with a bond  this bond is that neither of them can read well and when paul sees this he decides to act instead of being told what to do
mrleonard had gone through the same thing as paul only he went throughhigh school then colege not knowing how to read then he finally flunked out of college and no other college wanted someone that couldnt read paul was trying to learn how to read and now he had a reasoon to keep going and not give up
paul was effected because he has a problem reading just like mr leonard which is why paul was going to the learning center at the begining of the story paul didnt want to not learn how to read
paul understood that working hard in school is still important even though it gets hard the background information also shows paul that he is almost like mr leonard because he is becoming better at track and has trouble reading
the background information about mr leonard has a good effect on paul it shows paul that he is not alone with his reading problem also that mr leonard was a great runner but without education mr leonard did not become sussccefull in life it shows paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him like at the end after learning mr leonards past and how he cant read paul offters to train him and help him read
paul learns that mr leonard was a poor reader just as paul is paul now feels like he can accomplish great things if he works hard at them then at the end he returns him a favor by helping mr leonard become a better reader
he feels lied to

paul seemed shocked that mr leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner but was shocked to find out that mr leonard never could read i feel like paul feels better knowing that mr leonard couldnt read either and that he wants to help mr leonard out by teaching him how to read better just like mr leonard did by helping him get on the track team i think paul found out at a good time because i feel like that if paul knew that from the beginning he would never actually try to learn to run with mr leonard
the information the coach provides paul with enlightens and motivates him to make a better future for himself and to make mr leonard proud even though he is a weak reader paul finds that he is good at hurdles something he and mr leonard have in common after mr leonard shares his story paul is motivated to become a better reader as well as to help mr leonard to do so as well
he is surprised that mr leonard flunked out of college he was suspicious so he decide to ask mr leonard when he did he found out that mr leonard couldnt read
its makes paul wonder why mr leonard quit running track and college and when he asked mr leonard why mr leonard said it was because he couldnt read that good also it helped paul realize what kind of person mr leonard use to be like a good athlete a good person but not the smartest
the background information helps paul understand why mr leonard wanted to teach him how to jump hurdles and let him pass in the hallway when going to the learning center paul also now understands why mr leonard didnt talk about his past and was so adamant to teaching paul how to jump hurdles

when paul finds out that mr leonard had been an excellent runner in track he is somewhat confused because as the story says mr leonard is now only a hall monitor he wonders what had happened that caused him to drop so low in the order of things after he talks to mr leonard though he realizes that it is just as important to have a good education as it is to be good at sports it inspires him to accel in all areas of his life not just sports or school

the information about mr leonard motivates the narrator and it also makes the narrator feel more connected with mr leonard knowing they went trough the same thing
the narrator is shocked at how good of an athlete he was and did not tell anybody then the narrator realized that mr leonard did not tell the whole story about how he could not read and was struggling in college

when paul found out about mrleonard background he was shocked to knew that he was a track star that went to college but flunked out of it because he wasnt able to read and their was no one to help him
the story is explaining that only very few talented people get choosen for the gift that they will receseive after they get there talented opucation done
when paul find out about mr leonard he is shocked yet he feels the same as mr leonard paul listens to mr leonard speak about his past and realizes that mr leonards words are all too familiar paul too understood what it felt like to be embarrased this inspires paul to help mr leonard with his obstacle

the background information on mrleonard surprises paul it also ver much encourages him to push and try even harderhe also felt the feeling that his coach felt back in his college days when he couldnt read paul goes and helps mrleonard as he help him
paul can relate to the information quite well the emotions he heard in mr leonards words was kind of what he felt like when he was called on on class to read aloud or when everyone knew an answer and he didnt both paul and mr leonard can relate to one another
paul understood mr leonards situation of not knowing how to read paul felt the realization that mr leonard helped him excel at something which made paul feel good about himself
after paul learns about mr leonards past he feels that he can better relate to mr leonard because they are both inable to read knowing that mr leonard had flunked out of college even though he was a major 400 meter sprinter really let paul understand the seriousness of working hard and learning to be all that you could be he learned that he had to be determined no matter how discouraging the lack of reading skills truly is
when paul reads background it starts to make sence to him why mr leonard wants him to jump hurdles
i really have know clue 
paul realized the mr leonard was a hurdler in collage and that he can help them get better at track
the background information about mr leonard that effect paul is that mr leonard had prombles too and he had help from tutors paul was get help from mr leonard when he need help
paul wanders why mr leonard didnt tell him and paul wants to know about his past when mr leonard tells him paul understands why mr leonard didnt tell him mr leonard didnt want paul to get any bad ideas in his head paul was familiar with the feeling mr leonard had
during the story when paul gets background infromation about mr leonard he gains a new respect for the teacher and becomes a closer friend  this can be seen in the text because in the last two paragraphs it is impied that paul would help mr leonard learn to read
that mr leonard grabowski and paul are alike in many ways  they were both wanted to be in track but they couldnt becuse they were not good enough so everybody thought so then mr leonard was the best 400 meter runner so that made paul want to be just like him
that mr leonard cant read just like paul paul looks up to him because mrleonard went threw what hes going threw right now that he had a hard time in college
he feels like he knew exactly where mr leonard was coming from he also didnt know how to read and was becoming a great athlete he is also empathetic towards mr leonard at the end of the story paul tells mr leonard its time to start your training indicating that he is going to help mr leonard learn to read
well paul is doing really poor in school and mr leonard was good at sports and bad at school to so he wants to make sure that paul has at least something that he is good at so he shows him about track
the effect that the background information has on paul is that it causes him to wonder why mr grabowski never continued his career as a runner he wanted to know more because he asks well what happened after that
the background information being good or bad gives paul the motivation to do as well as he could it also encourages him and is a great example of leadership being said is exactly what a leader should tell someone who they look to encourage or motivate
the effect that the background information has on paul is that he is amazed that mr leonard was a hurdle runner  in fact he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and borke many of records  after hearing this paul wanted to help train him with his reading
mrleonard told paul that he could go big with his runing careerif he worked har at it and had pual workout with the team
paul said that all of mr leonards words were all to familiar to him and he knows how he feels
there is a lot of effect of mr leonards background information one effect is that paul did not feel as bad about not being able to read because mr leonard was not very smart either once paul found out that mr leonard was a former college track star he knew he was in good hands paul knew that what mr leonard was teaching him was correct
at first paul is curious wondering why mr leonard was acting solemnly and then comes to realize why from mr leonards story as paul listens he feels familiar emotions coming from mr leonard emotions paul himself feels when he is in certain situations as mr leonard finishes paul indirectly offers to help mr leonard with learning to read better
he understands why he was helping him out with the hurdles it was like his obstacle in school when he didnt know how to read but his friends helped him out through school and the learning center for paul was like mr leonards friends but once he got to college his friends werent there to help him out anymore mr leonard wants paul to go onto college and make records and do what he wanted to do when he was in colloege but couldnt because he couldnt read and thats what made him drop out
paul is proud that the man who has been coaching him is a great athlete himself but wonders why he never ran after his freshman year he then wants to coach mr leonard in reading like mr leonard coached him in track
they bothe was good at track but neither of them was good readers and mr leonard didnt want to see paul drop or get kicked out of collegwe like he did
paul knew exactly how mr leonard felt about not knowing how to read paul felt the embarrassment he felt when he had read aloud infront of the class or having to answer questions he didnt know the answer too
mr leonards background effects paul because it realizes that he he is a lot like his self  mr leonard had reading problems when he was around pauls age and he was usually picked last for sports  that is when he found hurdles
it motivates him because they relate so much
this information gives paul a whole new view of mr leonard he sees a new man every time he looks at him because he never saw the track star in their schools hall monitor in the past now he sees something totally new a new insight to mr leonards ideology a new perspective from the man who got him started doing hurdles the narrators shock flows out of him when he asks mr leonard why he didnt tell him about his past then when mr leonard explains why he dropped out of school paul is bewildered but this gives him a new drive to do well in the learning center this also gives him the idea of getting mr leonard some help with the learning center the information about his past spurs all of the readers actions in the sequence of events that make up the falling action and resolution
paul was a nervous person and he wanted to make his teacher and coach happy if he runs through the hurdles to get past the obsticles not just on the track but also about life too he wanted get away from his fears so that he can move on with his personal life
he knows where leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either he then wants to help leonard because he had helped him with tracki found this out from the last two paragraphs of the story
at first paul only thinks of mr leonard as a hall monitor who checks his pass twice a week then mr leonard helps him seek an extracurricular activity he is interested in and paul doesnt quite understand why he is helping after talking to the track coach looks up mr leonard on the internet and talks to him about his past experience with track and learning he then understands what he is trying to do for him mr leonard was in the same position as paul and understand how he feels when it comes to school so he tries to find something that paul will succeed in to help him build his confidence after mr leonars helps him paul feels as if he should give back and help mr leonard in return
paul is concerned that mr leonard didnt tell paul about his track career before when he asks mr leonard about it he finds that mr leonard cant read either he sees that even though mr leonard cant read he still had a great accomplishement this gives paul hope that he can be good at something too
paul was shocked that he broke recordshe was supprised that mrleonard did thathe also learned that he went to colledge but didnt stay in
makes him feel like he knows the person better since they have all that information about him
mr leonard was a good athlete but not a good student not because he didnt try but because he couldnt read very well paul and mr leonard are similiar because they are both good at hurdles but they had trouble reading the college scouts told me that my grades didnt matter that id have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out he wanted paul to be a good reader so that if he gets a scholarship for hurdles than he wouldnt lose it because of his grades
it helps moviate him to become a better reader and to try to help someone less forturnate
paul was always the last one picked in gym he then background checked mrleonard and found that he was a track stathat inspired him to get fit and to enjoy gym even to strive to be the first picked in gym he also was wondering why mrleonard didnt tell him about his past tack star statis and soon after the confrontation mrleonard was inspired to re live his past as a track star
paul realized mr leonard was like him in many ways  he realized that although he couldnt read either mr leonard suceeded in a way  paul has the oppurtunity to do something mr leonard couldnt be a good athlete and learn to read  mr leonard didnt have learning centers paul realized how blessed he really was
mr leonard was just like paul at his age he could not read but then mr leonard does what his former coaches did for him and paul taught mr leonard how to read
the effect that background information mr leonard has on paul is that hes not very good at sports and is choosen last for teams mr leonard has also found out that paul is not a very strong reader and goes to the learning center to get help on that
when paul finds out about mr leonards past he is very thankful for the help on the track he now knows that even though he cannot read as welll as some others he is still very fast and can be one of the best thanks to mr leonards help
the background information that pauls recieves about mrleonard has an effect on paul because it lets him know he can do anything he put his mind to even if he has weak points
mrleonard  backround information affects paul because it show paul if you work hard you can reach you goals it also show how people can help other people mrleonard backround show his difficalty in reading just like paul paul even statesthe emotion in mrleonards words were all to familiar to me
after paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a great track star is surprised that mr leonard never told him about running in college  when mr leonard explains to paul that he could not read and flunked out of college paul knows how mr leonard felt because he could not read at the beginning of the story  after paul hears mr leonard tell him about his reading troubles he takes mr leonard to the learning center to help him for once learn how to accomplish something
he was kind of concerened why mr leonard never mentioned that he was a great runner that broke records
the background information about mr leonard are that mr leonard broke records when he was a freshmen in college that won the 4oo meter hurdles at the nationals he was not that good in school and only went to college cause he was a good athlete so he flunked out and didnt gradute they didnt have learning places back then
it affected paul because mrleonards story was almost the same as his and he could relate to the feelings of mr leonard like being called on to answer a question and not knowing it
after paul finds out the background information about mr leonard he realizes that he is in the same position as mr leonard  the teacher could not read when he was in high school either and did not get the best grades and he could not read  paul realizes that if he keeps working in the learning center and gets better at reading and when he gets really good at track he could be in the same place mr leonard was but farther  paul realizes that him and his coach could become very close because he is in the same position as mr leonard was when he was his age and the coach wants to help him achieve and go very far
mr leoanrds background taught paul a valuable lesson on doing well academically and in sports for example mr leonard words were familiar to paul and they were feelings of embarrassment
the effect the background information about mr leonard is encouraging to paul paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help mr leonard  at the end of the story he walks back to the school telling mr leonard that its time to start his training the background information of mr leonard encourages paul to help the hall monitor out
paul is a younger version of mr leonard when he was a high school student he saw that mr leonard achieved by training for the hurdles but he didnt have enough courage to learn to read he wanted to become something in life like mr leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important he also decided that mr leonard did him a favor so he will teach him how to read in return
mr leonards story has a powerful effect on paul  it helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles  many people have gone through what he is going through  they had a lot in common  paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability  paul is actually lucky  when mr leonard was in school they didnt have learning centers to help people read  paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received      paul looks at what he has been given and the time and effort mr leonard has put into him and decides that he should give something back  he takes mr leonard to the school for some training in reading
it makes him surprised and made him wonder why he wasnt still doing hurtles until he found out from mr leonard that he couldnt read the narrator was very impressed especially with him winning the 400 meter hurtles at the nationals and the fact that he broke records
when paul gets background information about mr leonard he was very surprized also he wondered what happend to him he understude him because paul also was not good in school
he finds out about his colledge track succes and wants to be like him
it has an effect on paul becuse it sounds just like him paul cant read very well at all he gets help which mr leonard did not really have the chnce to get help from teachers only students paul want to exel in school and track he wanted to over come his obsticals the hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and paul could over come them if he just trye paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school
it makes paul realize why mr leonard wanted him to meet him in the gym at 230 it explains why mr leonard cares anything at all about paul because he is a school hall monitor
paul is always getting picked last and so was leonard they both cant read so they are just alike and now they are both really good at jumping hurdles
the effect that the background information had on paul was shock  he was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star  paul was also confused  he wondered why mr leonard didnt tell him this  paul asked why didnt you tell me about this  paul couldnt believe it  that is why i think paul was both shocked and confused
when paul learns that mr leonards track career ended because of receiving poor grades paul felt sorry for him he knew mr leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him so paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping mr leonard in his struggles as well paul relates to mr leonard in the way that he knows what its like to be one of the ones who doesnt get good grades and being embarassed about the fact of not being able to read near as well as others paul immediately realizes all that mr leonard has helped him accomplish and he wants to help mr leonard accomplish something of his own
paul thinks he cna over come anything ads long as he can stick with it and practice at first paul was not a very good runner then mr lenord told him to bring sneakers and shorts the next day whne paul got serious about running and put his mind to running the he would do very good at running so if paul can practice and be good at running he will not be picked last any more for sports and will do good at his favorite sport
the background information that paul received about mr leonard helped him to realize why mr leonard had been helping him to excel at running paul felt a connection with mr leonard and wanted to do whatever he could to help mr leonard achieve his goals in return for mr leonard helping paul to learn how to run this is evident in the story in paragraph 45 where paul narrated this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him paul also said in paragraph 45 that the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to mefeelings of embarrassment paul was now able to empathize with mr leonard just as mr leonard empathized with him and an even stronger friendship between them was formed
when paul gets background information in mr leonard he sees that just like paul he struggled with reading and was also a runner  paul foreshadowed mr leonards story growing up through high school and college
paul was empithetic because he to knew how mr leonard was feeling i knew them wellfeelings of embaressment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt konw an answer everyone else knew
learning about mr leonards past helps paul in many ways when he realizes that mr leonard was a successfull hurdeler he feels proud and surprised that mr leonard would take the time to help paul succeed when paul discovers about mr leonards struggle to learn paul feels a connection with him he understands how mr lownard felt and after hearing his story he knows that he wants to do well in school before he didnt realize how much not being able to read could effect your future learning mr leonards background information helped paul be even more determined to succeed
the background information had a positive effect on paul it gave him the motivation to overcome the hurdles he was going througheven tho mrleonard wasnt the stongest student he was able to compete athleticlyit helped connect the two
the effect it has on paul is suprised he was working with somone who was really good at what he was teaching this kid paul was excited that he has someone to relate to and he might become sombody
the information that paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something when mr leonard asked paul about the learning center mr leonard let paul go after he told him he couldnt read now the information that paul got effected him by making him realize that since he cat read it doesnt mean that he cant be good at other things like sports because after paul gave the information printout to mr leonard mr leonard told him that since he couldnt read he had to quite track because he couldnt read and because of his grades in school and after he was told that paul realized that mr leonard was just like him in the sense that they both couldnt read and that since mr leonard helped him paul has to help mr leonard learn to read
after learing this background information paul realizes why mr leonard is just like him
paul would have almost the same background as him except pauls would be about high school
paul realizes that it is not just him that has problems anyone can over come the problems that one might have in life and still better themselves
the background information about mr leonard has an effect on paul that made him realize that he could help mr leonard in the same way he helped him at the end of the story he understood him more after and went on to help him
he relixes that he was a great at the hurdels soon paul relizes that mr leonard was a track and feild star back in collage and continues to let him coach to get ready to try out for the team as paul confronts mr leonard about his past at first he seems sadened by it i was a good athlete but not a good student we had no learning centers in our school i relied onfriends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard     but you went to collage paul said     things were different back then mr leonard replied the collage scouts told me that my grades didnt matter that id have tutors to help me but college work ia a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read     cmon mr leonard paul said walking back toward school its time to start your training
paul knows how mr leonard feels he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills this brings him closer to mr leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running
paul was surprised and when he confronted mr leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit he pressed for the answer by asking well what happened after that mr leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship causing him to flunk our of college paul felt he could relate to mr leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him telling him cmon mr leonard as they walked back towards the school its time to start your training so now they have both learned something from eachother one was how to work hard and become good at a sport and then teach one how to read better
paul is effected by mr leonards background information because mr leonard cant read just like paul and mr leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody
paul was worried about his reading dissabilities mr leonard was pushing paul to be good at track becuase mr leonard knew that paul would have a better chance then he ever would at succeeding in track and in studies
mr leonard used to be a good track star but ended up dropping out because he couldnt read when mr leonard finds out paul cant read he helps him get better at hurdles then since mr leonard helped paul get better at something paul helps mr leonard get better at something he was bad at
paul is effected by mr leonards beackground information because it is the same thing he is going through and paul feels empathetic towards mr leonard
the background information paul gets on mr leonard effents him because he finds out he is being taught by a former great this boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes paul want to achieve goals      when paul learns mr leonard flunked out it motivates him to try to get better as a student because without the grades he would never make it in college he also wants to return the favor by teaching mr leonard how to read
the background information has a effect because he didnt know that he was in track and it would have been easier for paul to say something to him if he knew about it
paul is used to obeying mr leonard he does not ussualy stop and talk to him and seems a little nervous around him
the background information changes pauls view on the mr leonard he knows now that he can help mr leonard read while mr leonard teaches him how to hurdle in a sort of compensation in pauls eyes paul feels more motivated at the end of the story because mr leonard is like him in so many ways that he feels he can achieve something like he had done in college
the information brought mr leonard and paul closer because paul felt like mr leonards feelings of embarrassment were familiar to himself
when paul finds out about mr leonards background information he feels that he can relate to him paul could tell that when mr leonard told him what happen to him in college he was embarassed just like he was when he was chosen to read something aloud and didnt know the answer he feels grateful that mr leonard had given up his time to help him excel at something then paul felt that he had to help him out
paul became very compassionate after getting information from mr leonard paul started to understand how mr leonard feeling about his life so paul decided to teach him how to read also paul got some motivations for himself by the story of mr leonard he found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle he still have to study very hard he still should finish his college and get his scholarship becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from mr leonards experience no college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read that made paul want to study harder than before
the information about mr leonard effects paul greatly paul now has to goals to strive for hurdles and reading mr leonards personal feats will push paul harder and further to reach his goals
paul found information on the website mr leonard asked him to look up he found out that mr leonard was a very good athlete in college leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at nationals but he couldnt continue on in college because his grades were poor leonard didnt want paul to be like him he wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time so he helped paul train and paul helped him how to read
the effect on the information that paul has received is remarkable information to him he finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle was actually a really good hurdler in school when paul takes back the information to ask mrleonard about the article paul comes with a grin on his face that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like mrleonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle
the effect of the background information that paul gets from mr leonard is paul now knows that he is not the only one with a hard time it helps paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish
the backround information about mr leonard excites paul because paul is likeing doing track every day and is ammazed by the success that mr leonard has had with track in college then the information about how mr leonard couldnt read inspires paul because paul is going through the same thing
paul starts to understand why mr leonard is helping him with track he also realizes why the first time at the track mr leonard did not know his name
the effect that the background information about mr leonard had on the reader is that mr leonard could not read and he was trying to help someone that was also in his postion so it shows that he is a kind man that cares about people and helps people if they need it  the effect that the background information has on paul is that he realizes that he can be successfull just like mr leonard even though he can not read
paul feels he can relate to mr leonard paul knows how if feels to not be able to read he knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud also he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew
the background information about mrleonard motivated paul and encourage him  of working harder there are many plots that can support the point among which one detail is predominant  as it is mentioned in the paragragh when paul heard the experience of mr leonard he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class mrleonards story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesnt study hard and give it up it will cause a great pity in his life   from what has been discussed above the background information of mr leonard had a positive influence on paul motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for mr leonard
the backgroung information affected paul by letting him know mr leonard cant read too  this shows paul that he can get better and not give up  it also build his relationship with mr leonard by going to the learning center together
paul is amazed he couldnt believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college
paul was surprised to find out that mr leonard had at one time run track this is evident in paragraph 35 line two when paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks why didnt you tell me about this paul also began to relate to mr leonard after mr leonard told him that he also couldnt read this fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when paul said i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew finally paul felt that he should be kind and help mr leonard learn to read just as mr leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles the final paragraph reads cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training
paul found out that mr leonard couldnt read like himself he also found out that mr leonard was a track star and that he couldnt go any further in track than he did because he couldnt read with finding that out paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and mr leonard could work on it together
the background information that paul discovers about mr leonard helps paul realize that mr leonard is trying to help paul in life because no one helped mr leonard instead of just letting paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him mr leonard steps up and gives paul what mr leonard himself never had
the background information that paul learns about mr leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help mr leonard it surprises paul because he asks mr leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star the information also encourages him because at the end of the reading paul decides to teach mr leonard how to read
he finds out that mr leonard is a poor reader and paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder
in the beginning of the story paul thinks mr leonard is just the hall montitor then after he gets the background information on mrleonard his viewpoint changes he realizes that mr leonard is just like him but mr leonard didnt have a learning center to help him read when he was in school this caused mr keonard to flunk out of college which is why he is helping paul also the background information makes paul emphatic towards mr leonard and will probably cause him to go to college and not flunk out for mr leonard
the background information influences paul it is because of the information that he wants to join the track team
after he found out so much information about mrleonards background it incouraged him to work even harder he started to believe in himself he new that he could accomplish anything as long as he put his mind to it not only did he believe in himself mrleonard believed in him too
paul feels the same mr leonard doesthe emotions in mr leonards words were all to familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew this man had to given the time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him     paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for mr leonard toocmon mr leonard i said walking back toward schoolits time to start your training paul is inspired to help out mr leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college he is eager to helpits one of the best things to do is help someone even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks
in this story the background information about mr leonard especially at the end is similar to the situation the narrator was in  for example at the end when mr leonard mentioned that he had failed out of college which was comparable to the situation the narrator was in because of his inability to read  realizing this mr leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did he can overcome the obstacles which were similar to the obstacles he had
the effect that paul had was consideration more than anything because mr leonard was just a  hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that when paul found out about mr leonard he wanted to find out why mr leonard gave up on his dream but he later found out that he flunked out of college paul found this out because he look up that url that the track coach gave him and he asked andpushed the answers to pauls questions so he tried to live his dream out on paul in a way
the information paul gets inspires him to keep up the good work paul also knows that he needs to keep up his tutoring in order to stay on the team
he was suprised to discover that he was so good at one point in time and he wanted to know what happened and why their werent any other stories
it makes paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems also they are both good hurdelers
in the baxkgroung ionformation it effects paul majorly because he thought that the teacher was great he did not know that he ran track or did any field activities until he recieved that website from a coach  he was kind of upset about it but he got up and encouraged his teacher to get back on the track
when mr leonard tells paul the college scouts told me that my grades didnt matter that id have tutors to help me but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work i lost mt scolarship and fluncked out no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read i feel that it opeed pauls eyes and made him think if himslf i belive that information made paul think of his future and how him and mr leonard arent that different also when paul says cmon mr leonard its time to start your training i feel paul and mr leonard are closer because mr leonard told paul thoes secret things about him
it has a very big effect on paul because mr leonard went to college to be on the track team and he flunked out because he was not a good student paul is also having a problem with his grades because he cannot read very well so he goes to the remedial reading program twice a week  and he looks up to mr leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did      mr leonard flunked out of college because the college scouts told him that there would be tutors at the college that could help him get his grades up but there werent any so he flunked  mr leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing
well paul dose not know how to read that good and when he gets on the url and when he asked mr leonard about it and he says he dose not know how to read paul knows how that feels and then he gose and showes him how to read
i believe that paul is changed even more by finding out about mr leonards college life it shows paul that even if youre bad at education you can still be great at other things it opens up a new world for paul is what im saying overall
the background information about mr leonard makes paul realize that eventhough  he might be terrible at reading he needs to keep practicing and overcome his fears just like he has done with the hurdles
paul learns that mrleonard was very good at track in college it effeects paul because paul is pretty much just like mrleonard he is good at track but not so good in school
the background that paul got of mrleonard effected him possitively now that paul knows just because you cant read doesnt mean you cant do anything you put your mind to
it tells him that if mr leonard can win at these huirdles and teach him how to do it he can teach mr leonard how to read
paul is in the same situation as mr leonard when mr leonard asked paul what his name is  he should of known it because he had check pauls pass for the past two weeks but mr leonard did not know it because he could not read
paul feels some what connect to mr leonard seeing how they both have reading disabilty and now they are both good at jumping hurdles mr leonard that since he didnt get proper help with his reading problem and paul was that paul could do better then him with reading and track
mr leonard helps paul find something that he can be good at and paul probably takes mr leonards kindness for granted he is certainly grateful for mr leonards kindness but fails to see mr leonards motives when paul learns about mr leonards background about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college it profoundly changes pauls view of mr leonard      according to paul this man had given his time to help me excel at something he realizes that mr leonard fully understands paul and that hes trying to give paul confidence to succeed mr leonards story also encourages paul to help mr leonard in return by helping him improve his reading skills
mr leonard is like paul a poor reader so he feels bad for him also he sees himself in him by taking him to the track he is good at track just like he was also he was a poor reader and thats why he flunked out of college
in the story the trach coach advises paul to look up background information on mr leonard  whe he does he discovers that mr leonard was just like him  they both had problems reading  therefore paul understood why mr leonard tried so hard to help him excel at something  paul also understood how mr leonard felt embarrassment and the longing to be like other kids it affects paul because now he knows that he can be good at whatever he puts his mind to all thanks to mr leonard
the background information on mr leonard is impowering for paul in specific ways paul had no idea about mr leonard because a track and feild star but he listened to him anyways when the coach gave him the url to look him up he was surpirsed when he confronted mr leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce he wondered what happened why he hadnt done it since he won the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman paul could really relate his story to mr leonard because he as well couldnt read unlike mr leonard he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read when mr leonard was done explaining his story he thought since he help him that he would help him learn how to read the background information help him connect with mr leonard on a whole new level
paul ask mr leonard why he kept such a proud accomplishment from him
the background information helps paul by relizing if you want ot become a good athlete you have to be an even better student to do what you like do to
at first paul probably felt confused and upset with mr leonard for not telling paul about his past but when mr leonard told him why he didnt tell paul paul understood why  they were both in the same situation somewhat
well this collage student said he want to be an athlete and win lot of matals
during the story gifts paul learns some interesting and shocking information about mr leonard paul finds out that mr leonard was a 400 meter champion and he questioned him what happened after once mr leonard reveals the information to paul he was shocked paul realized that he wasnt alone and he had someone who was like him someone who couldnt read knowing this paul was releaved and was glad to help mr leonard with his reading
it shows him that even though mr leonard cant read that he can still do other things just as well as other people it also shows him that he will need to try hard and never give up
he felt familiar with the emotions of embarrrassment that mr leonard felt paul was grateful that mr leonard had given his time to help him succeed at something he wanted to show respect and help mr leonard do something too he wanted to help him learn to read
during the story paul finds out that mr leonard was once a great 400 meter hurdler paul looks up to mr leonard because he had trouble reading as well this motivates paul to work hard during school and on the track
paul sees mrleonard is a role model and that paul wants to help him
when paul found out that mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdle he wonderd why mr leonard didnt tell him they when paul figured out that mr leonard flunked out of college paul knew felt his pain paul also has a hard time in school paul wanted to do something for mr leonard because he helped him with hurdles paul is going to help mr leonard read
the background information effects people because it showed that everybody is good at something in life
he feels that it was strange that mr leonard doesnt share with him his past acheivements when hes training him to run hurdles  so he is supprised that mr leonard is such a great hurdler and it prompts him to ask why he didnt continue that carreer  when paul finds out about mr leonard flunking out of college he felt sympathetic for him because he couldnt read either
paul seems more confident about himself that now he knows mr leonards background paul his happy that he knows somebody that also struggled in school just like him
paul found out that mr leonard was a track star in college and that he flunked out due to bad grades paul was suprised that someone that good was teaching to him to succeed like mrleonard did
when paul realizes that mr leonard struggled with the work required of him in high school and college he feels immediately sympathetic toward the hall monitor because of his similar situation in my opinion he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point and he realized at last why mr leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school as is usually the case with students and their teachers paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that mr leonard has had his own difficulties in life     however mr leonards story also has another effect on paul  it encourages him to work harder so he doesnt suffer the same fate after this paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes after being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesnt do so he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like mr leonard has     paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school which he took for granted in the past although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when mr leonard didnt have the same luxury
the background information makes paul look at his own life and see that he is struggling with same things that mrleonard delt with mr leonard was a track star ut he could not read he flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read at the end of the story paul wants to help mr leonard out by helping him read
the background information shown who mr leonard aws in the past paul seen this and was encouraged by this becasue he was like mr leonard this help him to practice runnung and he help mrleonard to practice reading
paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star and stoped because he couldnt read so paul teaches him to read because mr leonard tought him something
mr leonard got backgroung information o paul so he knew a little abut him this helped him do things better he practiced with him
he was a hall monitor and he mad sure people were always on tie for class no matter what and then it hit him he was training to be on the track team and he trained and trained and trained and he finally saw himself before thter track coach
it makes paul realize why he had him running on the track because mr leonard used to be a track star who also struggled with reading
in the begininng of the story mr leonard is the mentor and helps paul feel more involved in more activities than he already was  mr leonard also helps paul not feel like an outcast  mr leonard stays after school even longer to help paul unspokingly mr leonard has gone through the same trouble that paul is currently facing  paul then later finds that mr leonard faced the same trouble in high school     paul acts as if he is the mentor when he finds out about mr leoanrds situation in high school  pauls act of saying its time to start your training to mr leonard shows the value of a true relationship  paul is helping mr leonard after mr leonard helped him  one kind act to another is exactly what has happened without any of the background information none of this would have happened
once paul understands the background of coach it can reassure him that he has what it takes to overcome the obsticle he does not feel as isolated or alone he realizes that there are other individuals out there with the same problems and if they can overcome them he can too
the narrater paul is shocked beacause mr leanard was helping him and he never told him that he couldnt read either it drove him to try harder on reading and to help him  beacuse mr leanard never got the chance to get help with reading the emotions in mr leanards words were all to familier to me
paul was amazed by what he found out about mrleonard he found out that mrleonard was a freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records
the effect that mr leonards background information has on paul is he can relate to him paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports mr leonard cant read but was a very good athlete both of them are like one another and know how the other feels they both feel embarrassed because they cant read but like to do hurdles since paul discovered this information he wants to help mr leonard read just like mr leonard helped him learn how to do the hurdles
it effected paul in a positive way it gave paul a better understanding on why mr leonard was helping him
it shows that anyone can play a sport without have learning capablities also that paul could learn just about anything if he had practice
paul needs help and needs to work more harder on the way he exercises paul needs to be concentrated and very smart to try new things
he realizes that they are much a like they both have trouble reading it changes the way he looks at mr leonard
the background information paul received was shocking but inspirational he didnt know that mr leonard was going through the same thing as he was when he was in school so he tried to help paul earlier than when he was in school because he didnt have anyone to help him early in life
paul is confused and probably a little disappointed that mr leonard didnt tell him about his college days paul also understands when mr leonard tells him about his flunking out he says how the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to him
after paul got a background check on mr leonard it had really touched him mr leonard explained to him that he had flunked out so paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center
when reading the article the reader first sees mr leonard as a kind of mean guy that just likes to heard people along in the hallways at schoool because he is a hall monitor later on in the story when mr leonard takes paul under his wing to teach him how to be a good runner the reader learns that mrleonard used to be a very succesful track runner and used to be very well known the reader also learns that he flunked out of college and thats why he is no longer a runner      paul is a kid that cant read and mr leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner because he thinks it will help him out paul listens to mr leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well in the process of joining the high school track team paul learns that mr leonard used to be a very well known track star this confuses paul on why mr leonard didnt tell him this     when paul asks why he wasnt told he learns that mr leonard didnt tell him because he didnt want to brag about how good he used to be and that he was also embarrased because he had flunked out of school because he couldnt read          the fact the mr leonard took paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better and that mr leonard wanted to help paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean mr leonard is and paul sees that and is very greatful
the background information that the paul finds on mr leonard is very emotional for him because he dicoovers the reason that mr leonard is so motivated to help him paul has the same problem that mr leonard has with reading but the only difference is that paul gets help for his reading and mr leonard didnt so when he sees an apportunirty to help paul  he does and is return paul helps mr leonard in the end
he gets information that mr leonard was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals
mr leonards background informatioon gave paul incouragement to do better and push harder it also helped paul to realize that you have to work in school to make the grades that you want paul could relate to excatly how mr leonard felt when paul heard mr leonard tell his story he heard the emotion in his voice that was very familiar to him
during the story the reader gets background information about mrleonard the effects of that background information make paul realize that he needed to work hard for things that he wants in life this information also makes paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while hes at school an example with details would be the emotions in mrleonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew also mrleonards background information makes paul want to excel at something and paul wants to help out mrleonard
when paul finds this information it leads him to feel a connection with mr leonard paul knows that this man understands the feelings of embarrassment that paul has during school or when he is trying to read
when paul learns about mr leonard past it shows him that he can overcome his obstacles the way that mr leonard did  paul understands why mr leonard put so much effort into him also he should continue with his training so that he can get a schoolarship like mr leonard
i think that the background effected paul in a good and bad way paul understands and knows how mr leonard feels paul tells mr leonard to come on and that it is time to start his training
mr leonard was a good athlete but not a good student like paul mr leonard had the same problem as paul but didnt have learning centers in high school he had to use his friends for help but it was still too hard for him
in the story paul learns that mr leonard was very talented at hurdles and even broke records as a college freshman i think that this information paul learns has him a little confused on what happend to make mr leonard in the postion that he is today when mr leonard explains to him that he wasnt the strongest student and cant read very well it ties the whole story together and i think paul then realizes why mr leonard wants to train him in  the end of the story they kinda let us believe that paul is going to now help mr leonard with his reading
paul had no idea that mr leonard was such a famous track star he was in shock when he found out tht mr leonard had won so many trophys and that he won the 400 meter in hurddles
when paul learns the background information on mr leonard i think he felt like he had something in common with him both characters have learning disabilities and now both run track i think paul definitley felt like he had someone to look up to
that he didnt know that he was a track star when he went to collage and then mr leonard told him that he dropped out because he didnt know how to read its was the same thing for paul because he is good at hurdles but he is only in highschool but he also does not know how to read but he is getting help and can read a little bit and is going to teach mr leonard how to read to
after learning about mr leonards background i think paul starts to understand mr leonard better  he used to be a suspicious quiet man but now paul feels that he and mr leonard are alike in the fact that they both had trouble in school paul feels more comfortable knowing that mr leonard is like him and that he understands how paul feels
paul begins to feel empathetic for mr leonard because he knows what its like to fell embarrassed when he was called upon to read and couldnt or didnt know quite as much as the other kids i think he also realizes that there are others that have reading problems and can set those aside and work hard to achieve set goals
paul cant read just like mr leonard paul knew how mr leonard felt because he too could not read paul then started to train mr leonard too read because he helped paul with something paul wanted to return the favor
mr leonards story is one that matches pauls struggles with reading this information affected paul in a way that shows even the someone with a reading problem can be anything they want to be even a track star he is glad to know that someone else has had the struggles he has and can relate to his battles with homework and reading
the information paul receives helps him understand mr leonard
during the story the readers gets backround information about mr leonard the backround information effected paul because they both had things in common they both couldnt read well the response with details from the story include the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew
as the narorator paul get more information about mrleonard he starts to relize that mr leonard had the plan to introduse paul to track when he first meet him in the hallway also it motivates paul to do good in school as well as track and it makes it so he could conect better with mr leonard because the bolth have problems reading
paul is supriszed that mr leonard failed his collage classes and at the end he makes the effert to help mr leonard to read
the backround information that paul gets makes him want to try even more it inspiras him to want to go to school and get good grades succeed be confedent and learn how to read
mr leonard use to be a big track star he was amd excelent athlete but just like paul he struggled with learning and reading he kept the information about his past away from paul because he was extremely embarassed about him failing and flunking out of college          when paul found out about mr leonards accomplishments he was confused as to why he never said anything to him then mr leonard explained to him about how he was never a very good student but colleges didnt care because he was such a greath athlete when paul is told that he was a awful reader also he felt compelled to ivite mr leonard to his learning center
the information has a big effect on paul because he was wondering why mr leonard was wanting him to run track he finds out that mr lenord was a college star in hurdles and he could not read well eather so he wanted paul to have a life like he wanted to have
when paul found out that mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles he was surprised when he seen mr leonard the next day at practice he asked why he did not tell paul about his award and record breaking college life mr leonard responded with  things were different back then the college scouts told me that my grades didny matter that id have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder then high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no nother school wanted a runner who couldnt read so in the end paul had realized mr leonard had changed his life so it was time to change his paul took him to class and said cmon mr leonard its time to start your training
i think it gives paul some encourgement knowing that he was taught and trained by a national winner in track it alos opens up a few connections he as with mr leonard about being able to talk about track instead of just the learnign centermr leonard is a role model of paul
mr leonards background is being a track hurdler which paul wants to find a sport that he can do so his teacher helps him and coaches him they both have or had problems with reading and they both got help for it

the way the reader reads the story and gets background information on mr leonard is a way that you can also get background information on paul you can tell paul is more shy that some people by the story telling you that mr leonard is empathetic for him paul might be one to get discouraged a lot or easy because mr leonard describes how he keeps his track history to himself because he does not want to discourage paul
he is happy but also sad the mr leonard had to go through the same thing happy because hes not the only one that has to go through it sad because he knows what its like when mr leonard tells him why he had to quit hes sympathtic because he goes through the same thing he can now have someone that knows what it feels like to be called on and told to read and not know how
he felt connected to him because he knew how it felt to be embarrased about not being able to read well he wants to repay him for all the help mr leonard gave him

paul begins to wonder why mr leonard has never shared his past accomplishments with paul he confronts him one day after making the track team and asks why he hadnt shared the information before when paul learns that mr leonard flunked out of college because he was a poor reader paul takes the initiave and helps mr leonard like he helped paul

when paul gets background information about mr leonard paul feels empathetic for him the background information makes paul want to help mr leonard because he feels the same way the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew 
what paul had found out i think helped him to persue in his learning and to help him be good in the hurdles i think that paul started to think to realize that education is one of the highest things that you can get paul saw mr leonard as a great athlete who didnt have the good grades to finish the total package i think that paul will learn that you have to be smart and have an education and then the rest will come later
he finds out that mrleonard went to college for track not for grades because he couldnt read now paul is more comfortable
he is curious on what happened to mr leonard and wants to know more about him

paul was concerned about why mr leonard never told him about this mr leonard told his story and explained why he it made him sad and how he dropped out of college for poor grades and became a hall monitor paul related to how he felt being part of a select few not knowing how to read paul responds by offering mr leonard training
paul couldnt believe the details about mr leonards past and wonders why mr leonard never shared this with him mr leonard was a fantastic hurdler but not isnt very studious mr leonard couldnt read so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it this is similiar to pauls situation they both are good hurdlers they couldnt read and they felt embarrassed about it so once paul hears about how mr leonard cant read he wants to train him to read just like mr leonard trained paul to be a good hurdler
the effect it had on paul was that he didnt understand it thats why he says to mr leonard why didnt you tell me about this and mr leonard tells him about being a star athlete but not a good student and explains that he couldnt read just like pauland i think paul could relate to that and apply it to his own situation

mr leonard background informatiosn makes paul feel bad for him so she starts to help them and went from being one of his students to be his trianer
pual felt some sort of empathy because he knows what its like not being able to read well in the story paul knows what mr leonard went threw it said he knows the feelings of embarrassment when someone called on him to read aloud
it shows paul that no matter what you need to learn to do things your own self and that no matter how hard the obsticle is you put all your effort and practice and you will get better mr leonard didnt know how to read and he found out the hard way that you cant relay on anyone you will have to learn by yourself pual finds out about mr leonard and figures out that all he wants to do is to help pual to become better and learn  about hard times that he has had in the past and he does not want pual to have the same problem he did
ehen paul was reserching on mr leonard he found out the he to could not read paul and mr leonard have that diability to read and that is what braught them to being friends and why mr leonard brought him to the track to have him jump the hurdles it teaches paul to overcome the tough obsicals in life as mr leonard almost did

paul hears that mr leonard was a college track star but was kicked off the team due to his poor grades  paul wasnt disapointed in mr leonard because of his hard times but was inspired to help mr leonard like he had helped paul
the background information helps motivate paul into helping mr leonard read in the last paragraph it tells how paul is going to help him read
it makes paul feel like he can be just as good as mr leonard but he wants to try and get good grades and not rely on others to get by
that is not a very good reader so he went to the learning center to try to get help with his reading skills cause he really wanted to run track so he broght up his english class grade and he got torun track
i think it had a bad feeling on paul at first just for the fact that he didnt tell him but once he got to know him he may have thought there is a ligit reason to why he didnt tell him
the effect on paul about discovering the background information on mr leonard is empathy paul understands exactly how mr leonard feels embarrassed paul feels led that sinse his coach had taken such an interest in him and took time to help him overcome his obstacles that he should return the favor and help excel mr leonard with his disability
that paul is able to do much more with this kind of help he is one of the select few of the remedial program
as the story begins the reader learns mr leonard is simply a hall monitor doing his job no one really seems to take notice in him and school goes on in the same way it always does it isnt until paul gets stopped by mr leonard one day that we first get a glimpse of who this hall monitor is many foreshadowing events occur from this point forward the empathy in his eyes when he learns paul cant read the mysterious way he calls paul to the gym and then to the track and even the encouragement he gives to paul gives the reader many hints on who this character is as a person when the track coach gives paul some interesting information to look up about this said hall monitor that is when we really see who mr leonard was we learn how successful he was on the track but when asked about this we also learn how unsuccessful he was off the track paul is very shocked to hear mr leonard grabowski was an avid hurdle jumping track participent in his day but when he goes directly to the man behind all of it mr leonard he gets a more personal outlook on what it was truly like for him this gives paul a new appreciation for his education but also for mr leonard after realizing just who this hall monitor once was and in a way still is

when he finds out who mr leonard really is he feel like he should help him out by showing him how to read because mr leonard shows paul how to become faster in running and give good tips
the affect the background information has on paul is that paul had no clue that mr leonard ran track and was really good when paul found out he talked to mr leonard and ased him why he never told him and the reason was because mr leonard could not read eitherthis had a big affect on pauld because paul could not read either but was really great at track
the back round information he recieves about mrleonards reading problem makes paul want to help him after he has done so much for him
when paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star in colleg he then understands why he wants him to learn track because of the simularities they both have
the affect that the background information has on paul is paul might have been going down the same route as mrleonard by not knowing how to readsooner or later paul was going to get tired of trying to learn how to read and drop out mrleonard kinda saw his self in paul and didnt want the same thing to happen to paul that happened to him so he made him come to the gym so that he could motivate him
paul finds tha mrleonard was just like him he was good at sports but he wasnt a good student he relied on friends to help with his school work had a scholarship and flunked out mr leonard also couldnt read just like paul
the effect that it has on paul is that he wants to try harder and teach him how to read the end paul tells him cmon mr leonard its time to start your training shows that he wants to teach mr leonard something
when paul finds out that mr leonard cant read it motivates him to do better because that shows him that just because you cant do something doesnt mean youre not special in your own ways mr leonard teaches paul how to jump hurdles to help him become confident and enjoy life even though hes behind in learning how to read
it gives paul confidence because now he knows he is not the only one that is not able to read either at the beginning of the story he felt all alone and was tired of always being the last one chosen for a game when mr leonard came along and helped boost his confidence when he found out the things about mr leonard it made him want to do good for others that struggle and so therefore paul wanted to help mr leonard how to read
it has a big effect on him
paul was in school and couldnt read he never knew how to read he met a school coach began hurdling on mr leonards track became on the track team     paul thought that mr leonard went to college but he was wrong mr leonard flunked paul read mr grabowski website and finally figured out that he couldnt read either he was the same as pual
1 not a bad first effort 2 that was terrible3youll do better next time
the background information that paul got from the internet showed that mrleonard use to hurdle and that he went to college but the question was why he was there after that it turned out that mrleonard didnt learn how to read either
the informactin that pauls learns about mr leonard is very shocking and confused about him
paul was upset that mr leonard didnt tell him about how he won national in the 400 meter hurdles paul printed the information out and confronted him and asked him why he didnt tell him about his past
paul seem intrested in what had happened he was amazed that mr leonard had ran track and beat records after doing research on grabowski just like his coach had told him to do he was curious to why mr leonard had not ran anymore after that once paul had found out that mr leonard had gone through the same thing he was he knew how mr leonard had felt because he had the same feelings of embarrassment mr leonard could not read either so when he went to college he lost his scholarship and flunked out but no other school wanted a runner that could not read paul then decided to do something for mr leonard and tell him to start his training
when paul found out mr leonard was in track and had broken records he was suprised and wondered why he did not hear about it before when paul figured out that mr leonard could not read he felt sympathetic for him because he wasnt good at reading either
paul is suprised to see that mr leonard was a excellent runner but he also develops sympathy towards his teacher because he says in line 45  the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassement he almost draws closer to mr leonard because he realizes they both have something in common
in paragraph  24 mr leonard ask paul what was his name so paul though that the was rare and also in paragraph 27 pauls coach told him to go to a track and field website and he found about mr leonard mr leonard was a good athlete before but he and paul had something in commun he couldnt read thats why when paul told him that he was going to a program where they were going to teach him how to read he let him go because he wanted paul to be able to learn so leater in life he could be someone important
i think the background information about mr leonard will mtivate paul to do better he has sympathy for the man because paul has the same problem himself paul wants to help mr leonard because mr leonard helped him
the effect the background information had on paul was one of surprise paul had not known that mr leonard was track star in college when mr leonard was helping him with hurdles paul did not realize this not until the high school track coach had told him to a search on mr leonard
he realizes that he is just like mr leonard because they both can not read
in my understanding it seemed like he was all around surprized because mr leonard was a track star and the fact he had a reading problem for the kind and friendly training mr leonard did paul felt he should return the favor and help him to read
he cant read and that is mr leoard have in common with paul and that is a promblem for him
in the story paul gets information on his track coach mr leonard an found out that he was a track star in college mr leonard had been a very talented runner but unfortunatley could not make it through college because he couldnt read consequently getting quicked out this applies to paul beacause mr leonard and he have something in common this inspires paul to do the best he can and to help his coach as well
this background infermation that he has on paul is paul is a boy that cant read and always gets picked last so he doesnt try any sports out or anything and mr leonard is a guy that is the hall monitor and he had went to college to run track and he droped out these 2 effect each other by how they were when they were kids leonard is trying to teack paul that if he tryes something he will get it
when paul finds out about mr leonards past he is surprised paul had no idea that mr leonard had been a track star this information encouraged paul to strive in learning to read at the same time paul could relate to him paul himself has trouble with reading so he felt empathetic towards mr leonard
it effects the story because paul and mr leonard are the same in ways it says in the story that paul was getting good at hurtles he just had trouble with school so he would go to the learning center mr leonard was a star college track runner but he wasnt smart enoough and didnt have a learning center to go to
when paul found the information about him he was surprised he didnt know that mr leonard was that great of an athlete but when he told him he couldnt read he felt that he could help mr leonard read and he could be come a better athlete and do better in school
paul was woundering why he had left college to be a hall monitor paul read how he broke record at thge college and was the best then mr leonard told him that he kind of have the same thing as paul he couldnt read
paul finds out that mr leonard was a college hurdler and this makes him wonder what happend he later finds out that mr leonard is just like him he has trouble with reading and so he was flunked out of college
they make paul feel sympathetic for mr leonard because it says in the text that the emotions in mr leonards words were all to familiar  paul knows what its like to feel that way because he doesnt know how to read so he feels embarrassed
paul is suprised that he was a college athlete and woundered why he didnt tell him about it
he realizes that mr leonard is trying to help him because he does not want paul to fail in college like did paul relizes that mr leononard is helping him because mr lenonard was in the same position he was in at that age and didnt do anything to better himself and he wants better for paul
he can relate to him in the way that he cant read very well
during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard this background information has an interesting effect on paul because paul is unsure why anyone that good would be unknown  paul assumes that mr leonard would have told him about his time as a college freshman winnning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals breaking the previous record as stated in the text  then after learning the complete story for how mr leonard went to college still unable to read and flunked out loosing his scholarship paul then connects this information with how mr leonard asked his name when he read his pass twice a week every week and concludes that he still is unable to read and paul decides to start tutoring mr leonard to teach hi to be able to read since mrleonard had taught him to run and jump hurdles very well
the information he get is about mrlenonard winning a track meet when he was in high school
the background information paul finds on mr leonard has a effect on him beacuse he also can not read mr leonard is a great guy and to find out he has the same problem as him just makes it a little easier to understand where hes coming fromlike he flunked out of college but he was so good in sports it kinda shows paul that he can do anything as longs as you have a good education
paul learns that mr leonard use to be a record breaking member of a track team after researching him paul asks what happened and mr leonard explains that his studies werent the best and that he couldnt read paul felt the same way about hiself he to feels embarrassed because he cant read something as good as other people paul decides that mr leonard helped him excel at something and that it was time to return the favor by taking him to the learning center
mrleonard was suspicious about what the narrator was doing when paul told the teacher that he couldnt read the teacher helped him out to be successful when he gets to high school
finding out that mr leonard couldnt read made paul want to help him learn just like mr leonard had helped paul become good at jumping hurdles in track
when paul discovers mr leonards past track excellence he becomes inquisitive then empithetic  pauls natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting mr leonard about the startling information he discovered online  his continued curiosity is demonstrated through his continual questioning and prying such as in but you went to college and i pressed paul later becomes empethetic when he offers to train mr leonard how to read and when paul states  the emotions in mr leonards voice were all to familiar to paul  when paul confronts mr leonard his natural curiosity turns to empathy
paul felt bad for mr leonard and he is teaching him how to read since mr leonard taught him how to hurdle
when paul learns about who mr leonard was that inspires paul paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well paul learns that mr leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years mr leonard accomplish much by setting national records and being one of the best runner this is told when the article says you were a college freshmen who won the 400 eter hurdles at nationals you broke records line 3839 this proves to paul that even though he is unable to read well he is still able to be the best at something else i his life     mr leonard also encourages paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read mr leonards says i lost my scholarship and flunnked out line 47 this statement is important to paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesnt learn to read so this encourages paul to work hard and learn how to read
the effects that mr leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself he felt the embarrisment when he was called apone to read or when he did not know an awnser every one else new it all reminded him of mr leanard who was a track star that flunked out of college because he could not read     paul then deliberates that because leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read
mr leonard going to the learning center
paul learns that mr leonard was a trackstar in college paul soon realized that mr leonard was a superb athlete but was not the best student mr leonard tells paul he flunked out of college knowing this paul is now motivated to take his grades seriously
the background information that paul receives about mr leonard motivates him in two ways it motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that mr leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help mr leonard to learn how to read better he helps him to read better because of the help mr leonard provided him in the hurdles this is in a way his repayment to mr leonard and it will also help him appreciate school more the background information helped the paul understand more about mr leonard while at the same time it helped the reader understand the motives behind what mr leonard did
when paul goes to the track coach the coach tells paul to look up the name grabowski  paul follows directions and finds out about mr leonards past  the website tells paul that mr leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college  when paul asks mr leonard about this mr leonard comences to tell paul that he was a fantastic runner but a less than average student  paul takes this information as an encouragement  it encourages him to excel in both school and sports  mr leonards past also encourages paul to help mr leonard by helping him learn how to read
mr leonard was a good athlete when he was younger but he couldnt read he was just not a good student much like what paul seems to be like since he cannot read so when mr leonard sees him in the hallway over and over again going to his study tables he notices that paul seems like a motivated kid that wants to do well so then mr leonard thinks that he should ask paul to start hurdling and if he works hard in that just like he does in school then maybe he can go off to college for hurdling but if he gets good grades he wont flunk out and that will make mr leonard forget about his past a little
the information concerning mr leonard gave paul motivation i believe this is because paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading after discovering that mr leonard could not read paul immediately wanted to help him as mr leonard had helped paul with the hurdles paul saw that not being able to read had damaged mr leonards life and he felt the need to help mr leonard paul shows this by saying cmon mr leonard its time to start your training also seeing their similarities motivated paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles this is the effect which mr leonards background information had on paul
paul is surprised that mr leonard went to collage and won nantionls when he was a freshman in collage he also was curious of why he quit
the information that paul finds about mr leonard is that he couldnt read in school either but he broke records paul was shocked that mr leonard didnt tell him about how good of an athlete he was paul was also shocked to the discovery that mr leonard couldnt read either paul knew that mr leonard was probably embrassed because he couldnt read and paul knew how it felt
paul might thought that he did not know what he was doing
he didnt know that mr leonard was a track runner and it pushed him to do better
mr leonard has helped paul building his skill as a hurdler and paul decides to help mr leonard learn how to read
after learning about mr leonards past he relizes why he is being helped by mr leonard because in high school mr leonard was a poor reader too paul decides he wants to help mr leonard to repay him for all that mr leonard has done for him by helping train to be good at something
mr leondard has done well so he trys to teach someone he can pass down too
after paul learns of mr leonards past he is curious and surprised paul learned of his achievements and wondered why he didnt continue to do track after he won the nationals it was hard for paul to understand why so much talent went to waste until he found out that mr leonard wasnt able to read paul felt closer to mr leonard because they had the same emotions
the background informations effect on paul is that it inspires him he sees how even though mr leonard couldnt read that he still excelled past people in something else paul looks up to mr leonard and paul wants to return the favor and help mr leonard
mr leonard is a hall moniter which makes paul think that he is just another teacher or adult that nobody wants to talk to  he kept students in line and out of trouble
he starts workimg out with the track team
the background information that paul gets makes him see that he was not the only one that couldnt read he is touched by the fact that mr leonard took his time to coach him into being better he wants to do something nice for mr leonard just like he did for him
when paul gets information about mr leonard about his pass it helps to motivate him to shoot for his dreams even if he does failed atleast he try to do it
background information can actualy help paul as to whether or not something has happened to the other person or not in the past and give information about a persons past
he understands how he feels because he has the same problemsbut he is getting help and is getting better
paul feels petrayed becuase he should have told him at the begginning that he was a star 
this information on mrleonard makes paul wonder why mrleonard didnt finish college it also made paul wonder why mrleonard had the job that he had because he was a track star and he broke records  how this information and what mrleonard told him all sounded so fimiliar to him because he was treated the same way how he couldnt read and was teased because he didnt know the answer to a question that evryone else knew
paul confronts mrleonard about the information he has discovered and talks about how come mrleonard didnt tell him about him breaking track recordshe also asks what happened to him breaking records and mrleonard told him he flunked out of college
paul was pretty shocked when he learns more about mr leonard he is also very suspicious because mr leonard never shared this with him knowing this helped motivate paul in track and learning to read
paul was a poor reader  knowing that mr leonard had flunked out of college just because he was a bad learner made him realize that they had something in common  mr leonard worked with paul to get better at track  mr leonard told paul to keep trying and work hard  paul hearing this knows now that you have to keep working hard and keep trying to succeed  paul knows that mr leonard should keep trying with his grade and in time he will get better
near the end of the story paul reads that mr leonard has had problems with reading although he was a great track hurdler that had a big effect on paul because paul has the same problem which is that he cant read he goes to the remedial reading program so he can learn to read the coach knew that so he had paul do the hurdles so he could show paul that even though you cant read you can still do well in other areas but you should still try your hardest cause life is hard when you cant read well
it made him think about his reading problem and that he needs to keep it up and hell get better which motivated him to help mr leonard to learn to read
the words that mr leonard said were all too familiar to paul he felt embarrassment when he got called on in class to read out loud
the effect that mr leonards background has on paul is really powerful paul realizes that this teacher isnt just some other annoying teacher mr leonard was in the exact same boat as paul was in and gave him advice on how to overcome it and encouragement to let paul know he could do it depsite being unable to read very well
when paul finds out about mr leonards past paul feels like he can relate to this paul says after learning how mr leonard funked out of college because he could not read the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment 45 this describes the situation paul is going through right now and it provides a stronger connection between the two characters
the background of mr leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change he is dissapointed that he dropped out of college and was force to quit track these are lessons to the narrator because he is young enough to take a stand for himself  and outline his life by knowing what he needs to know if he keeps working on his english struggles he will become better and better it is a lesson to make school a priority of track it also shows the narrator that if he works really hard at something and gives it 100 percent he can accomplish anything
the coach for the track team tells paul to look up grabowski on the website when he got home when he did this he relizes that the man who had been teaching him to hurdle was once a record breaking great athlete when paul confronts him about this grabowskibegins telling paul about his past and how he had actually lost his scholarship and flunked out of college because he could not read thats when paul learns that he couldnt read either then paul decides to help his trainer train learn to read
mr leonard use to be a runner as well
it reminds him of hisself from being good at track but not academically good atleast in reading
mr leonard went through similar expirences as paul like he relied on friends to help me get by
he felt bad for leonard becasue he was a good rinner but a bad reader and lost his scolership and droped out of college
when paul learns that mr leonard was a star track and field athlete in college he becomes confused as to why mr leonard kept it from him mr leonard then went on to explain that he had difficulty reading and flunked out of college paul felt empathetic because he had the same problem with school realizing that mr leonard had helped paul excel at something paul decided to start training mr leonard how to read
he seems surprised by it
it makes him feel better about himself it makes him want to put forth effort and get things acompleshed
that he knows if he puts his mind to it he could do anything because once he saw that mr leonard use to run track and he didnt know how to read then he knew that he could get really good at reading because look mr leonard is a teacher and he use not beable to read
paul learns that mr leonard was a track star in college which seems to inspire him he wanted to know about his experience and as mr leonard told him about it paul began to realize that he and mr leonard were pretty similar mr leonard taught paul how to run and do hurdles and paul wanted to help teach mr leonard something
the effects it has on paul is he is angery because mr leonard was a really good 400 meter hurdles  now he is at a high school teaching paul how to run track
it shows why mr leonard became friends with paul and taught him how to run track and it made paul want to do good at track and learn how to reead
paul realizes that the learning center will only help him and that he doesnt want to lose his dreams like mr leonard did because he cant read  mr leaonard tol dhim that nobody wants a track star that cant read and when paul realizes this he knows that he has to try to make what he wants in life happen
paul was surprised when he found out that mr leonard couldnt read either  paul would have never know unless the coach had gave him that website  it made paul want to try harder to learn to read so he could give something back to mr leonard 
the background information that paul learned about mr leonard motivated him  it showed paul that he could succed in something other than reading just as mr leonard did  just like the confidence paul showed when talking to mr leonard after he found out about mr leonards past
paul is surprised by the fact that mr leonard flunked out of college but as he is listening to him speak about his failures he realizes that he feels the same about his grades paul recognizes that this man had given his time to help me excel at something and decides to help mr leonard with schooling because he was never good at it
he can relate to him
whern paul realized mr leonard had the same problems as him it created a bond between themand they could understand where eachother was coming from
mr leonard was a major track star in college but they found out that he could not read so he lost his scholarship and he flucked out of college they did not wanted a kid that could not read mr leonard did not wanted paul to be like him so he told him all about his pass so he could get his grades up and go to college
after paul was informed about mr leonards backround he seems to get closer to mr leonard because they had a lot more in common then he had thought both mr leonard and paul had trouble with reading which caused mr leonard to want to help paul
the background on mr leonard inspired paul to succeed in track because of the expectations he had on him paul didnt want to let him behind because all the motivation he had encouraged him with and the reputation behind mr leonard
paul was surprised that mr leonard was a track star in college paul is also excited about his newly found knowledge of mr leonard he felt like he knew what mr leonard felt the embarrassment shows they are a lot alike
it made him feel sorry for mr leonard since he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college
to standy on top of things
the nararator becomes more accepting of his mentor and coach he feels that he has good support under his feet as he takes the path of the sport you can tell from the way the narrator speaks to mr leonard after he finds out about mr leonards past
though just a lowly hall monitor mr leonard used to be an extreamly successful track star when paul discovers this he wonders what went wrong in his life to pull him away from a life of success into being a hall monitor mr leonard then tells about how he couldnt read just like paul it affects paul in two ways first it makes him realize why mr leonard wanted him to start running because he saw himself in paul second it made paul realize that they had alot in common as well and made him want to persevere
mr leonard wants this boy to graduate college but he dont trust him
at the beginning of the story paul is having trouble in school reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports the hall monitor mr leonard decides to help paul by coaching him in hurdling paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds his coach was a freshman at college when he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records the problem was mr leonard had dropped out of college because he was failing he couldnt read very well either just like paul school was too difficult for him and he had to give up what he loved because no other college would accept him paul was moved by this and decided to get mr leonard a tutor so he could reapply to a college and live his dream
the background information helps paul because we now know that he has a former highschool track runner that broke records as a hurdler to help him be better as a hurdler than just a hall monitor
the effects that the background information had on paul were that he realized that just because youre bad at one thing doesnt mean that youre bad at every thing you do  this is because he learns that leonard also had problems reading but could win nationals as a freshman in the 400 meter hurdles
the effect the background background information about mr leonard has on paul is he can empathsize with mr leonard      paul struggled reading and then mr leonard helped him with hurdles and track when paul learned that mr leonard had flunked out of college even after being a big track star the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me paul related to mr leonards failure of college and  the fact he couldnt read because paul also struggled in it      the effect it had on paul was the he was familiar with the feeling it is foreshadowed in the last sentence that since mr leonard gave his time up to help paul excel at hurdles he was going to help mr leonard at reading
paul is overwhelmed that mr leonard has set and broken records at college he was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades
i believe it gave paul a sense of respect for mr leonard and courage to continue what he is doing since mr leonard went through the same problems as paul did and still went to college i believe paul gained respect since the hurdle mr leonard went over must have been difficult he also must have gained courage since if one person could do it he can do it as well
he is a  good people he  is smart he is a inteligent and hava a talentenyng and  he wanr mark the diferent adn the other people
paul is surprised on what he has learned about mr lenards back ground and he ask him what happend to him
mr leonard didnt want to tell paul about him being a track star in college becuase maybe he was ashamed that he had flunked out and didnt want him to know that he had trouble in school sometimes too
finding out mr leonard went to college but flunked out allowed paul to think about his future in their talk about college paul realized they have alot in common for example i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassement when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew
the effect of paul about the background information about mr leonard is that paul and mr leonard is almost alike because mr leonard and paul cant read and they both have run track in high school paul is willing to hepl mrleonaard with his problem
it made paul realize that mr leonard is very similar to himself it also gave paul the courage to contine in his track training paul felt very connected and concerned with mr leonard
mr leonard used to be a track star in college and he also doesnt know how to read so the influence that that had on paul is that even though you cant read that doesnt degrate you from doing other things in life
when mr leonards past is revealed it says the two of them on an even field  paul can now relate to mr leonard and understand that he is not alone  this information allows paul to respect his coach even more now
i think paul is a great guy
when paul knows about the background information about mr leonard he identifies him self on what he says because mr leonard couldnt read like paul but what was different is that the schools before didnt have anything to help students then what mr leonard is trying to do is to show that he is aforcanet for having a learning center that can help many students know then what they had then
he could feel what mr leonard was feeling and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something just as he helped paul so he was going to teach him how to read
the background information helps paul realize why mrleonard is so interested in hurdling but then leads him to wonder why it is that mr leonard is trying to help him learn to jump hurdles rather that anyone else
the background information has a significant effect on paul  when paul first learns from his coach that mr leonard was a star athlete he goes and asked about what happened  mr leonard told paul that he could not read and fluncked out of college which paul himself could relate to  in the end they both bettered the other and a way
when paul finds out about mr leonards past he is shocked at first mrleonard used to be a very successful track athlete however he didnt have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship     i think paul relates to what mr leonard went through so well is because paul was basically going through the same thing he had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class but he was extremely embarrassed he was afraid that he wouldnt be able to do anything since he believed that he wasnt that smart      mr leonard explains that he didnt have the resources when he was a child that paul has now all mr leonard had was friends to help him and unfortunately that didnt help his grades get better he wants paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read      paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing he relates to mr leonard and in the end that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read
when paul gets the back ground informtion about mr leonaredhe feels better because he knows now that not only does he stuggle but mr leonared did as well     this helps paul look past the reasons he has to go to the learning center and lets him focus on the things that he wants to do in sports and now paul can focus on being a better player all around in every sport he is in or trys
the background infortmation effects paul because it makes him want to work harder also it makes paul have empathy for mr leonard for example at the end when he says cmon  mr leonard its time to start your training paul wants to help mr leonard get back into track because he can tell mr leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger
it turns out that mrleonard had trouble reading just as paul did he flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for he taught paul how to run track well and when paul looked up mrleonards information he found that he was just like him it made paul feel closer to mrleonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track
the information it like how paul is struggling to read and that m leonard was going throught the same thing and that if he helped paul then paul would help him read and overcome the embarrasment of not being able to read well
he finds out the mr leonard doesnt know much about sports soo he tries to help him as much as he can
the effect on the backround information on paul seemed like they  made them very similair in a way  mr leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read there is a connection between them     when they first met mr leonard knew his own past and found out that paul could not read mr leonard wanted paul to be like him in a way just be better     the backround information that paul found out made him realize that they are the same and that mr leonard just wanted to help paul with his future and not be a hall monitor but to be somthing more succesful
paul can relate to mr leonard as being someone who could not read the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
paul is shocked that mr leonard didnt mention the fact that he was a college track star paul had no idea that his new coach was even a runner mr leonard didnt tell paul because he was embarrassed that he flunked out but in the end it showed paul why mr leonard wanted to help him
the effect of the background information on mr leonard is good and bad information some good news is that he is a good track coach but the bad is he fluncked out of school
the backround information that paul finds out about mr leonard effects him in a positive way because it makes paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time mr leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college because no school wanted a runner who could not read paul goes on to say that he knows mr leonards feelings of embarassment all to well happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class
the story has an effect on paul because he got the website url from the high school track coach and paul went and looked at the website and seen some information he didnt know about mr leonard and wondered why he never told paul and then paul and mr leonard talk about it after paul showed him the page he printed off and then paul realized what he could do for mr leonard after hearing the story
mr leonard was a hall monitor that was is job so paul is the main charatcer mr leonard wants to get him in to sports also paul wa in college
it inspires paul to let mr leonard help him keep becoming a better athlete
conversations about how i cant read
both paul and mr leonard are poor readers paul feels hes not good at sports mr leonard used to be a great hurdler so he teaches paul how to be a good hurdler when paul finds out that mr leonard is a poor reader also he brings mr leonard to the learning center to help him
i feel that the background information that paul discovered about mr leonard gave paul motivation  paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until mr leonard helped paul to achieve jumping hurdles  even though paul was good at jumping hurdles he felt as though he wasnt good enough  when paul found out that mr leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that mr leonard flunked out it make paul want to try harder in multiple things  he wanted to try to get better at hurdles but he also wanted to finally learn how to read so that he didnt end up like mr leonard  paul even decided that since mr leonard helped him achieve something he was going to help mr leonard learn how to read
mr leonard had a background on paul they both got alond very well mr leonard teach paul how to play sports and teach him how to do his work
when paul gets the background on mrleonard he is filled with quetions of understanding then he find out mr leonard was exactly like him but leonard wasnt able to get help with his schooling and ended up flunking out of school and loosing everything he had except his records and paul in the end went and helped leonard how to read
the background information you get in this article really helps you understand the story better it tells you why mr leonard asked the kid for his name at the track because he couldnt read it on his pass him flunking out of college also helped you understand that he wasnt very smart or else he would have graduated from college mr leonard likes helping paul in his track because it is something he loves and he also wants to help paul get better in something so he isnt always last for everything and it would boost pauls confidence
during the story paul does not know much about mr leonard paul only finds out about him when he talks to the schools track coach the track coach had told him to visit a website so paul did and found out about mr leonard paul was surprised that mr leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened after paul found out that mr leonard could not read he took it upon himself to repay mr leonard for what he had done for him
paul is encouraged after training and learning that mr leonard also could not read he was encouraged to teach mr leonard to read while paul himself was being coached mr leonard knew what paul was going through which is a reason he had paul start hurdleing in the first place and when paul found out that mr leonard had been in the same boat that paul was in it made him look at life in a new way
mr leonard was a tough stick to the rules kind of man and this made paul obey him paul would never question mr leonard or make rude comments because mr leonard was too stern in the story it said that mr leonard would stand in the hallways and say move along people move along this shows that he was in charge and always followed the rules also paul had known mr leonard since he started middle school
he was disturbed that mr leonard didnt tell him that he was a star athlete in track and was wondering why he didnt tell him     mr leonard told him to look the coach and he did but he looked up mr leonard as well and thats how he learned that he was in college track
he fineds out that mrleonard it really not what he thinks he is
paul finds out about mrleonards past and is surprised when paul asks what happened after that he is surprised to find out that mr leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out all because he had a difficult time reading this enourages paul to work hard and makes him want to help mr leonard the way mr leonard helped him
some of the background information the paul get about mr leonard is shocking to paul seeing this information paul has a whole new look on mr leonard because he knows that mr leonard would do anything to go back to track
paul feels a connection to mr leonard he states that in paragraph 45 sentence 1 they share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph 46
the background information about mr leonard shows paul that he was a former star athlete this also affects him later when he is told that he dropped out due to his lack of reading skills
paul feels motivated to work harder at track because he has good grades and he can read which is something mr leonard never had paul also is sympathetic for mr leonard and he tells mr leonard its time for his training as they walk back to the school paul is implying he is going to teach mr leonard how to read
that he has trouble with reading and he goes to the distance learning lab everyday he has talents that he doesnt know he had
paul is not able to read and he is one of a select few in the remedial reading program twice a week he left english class early for the learning center in the basement where he worked with a tutor
the effects the background information had on paul paul could relate to how mr leonard had felt he was happy that mrleonard had given up his time to help him excel because he nows what it was like not being able to read
mr leonards background is very familiar to paul mr leonard had feelings of embarrassment when paul was called upon to read aloud when paul didnt know an answer everyone else knew mr leonard is more closer to another teachers because he has same experience as paul      that is effected pauls feeling
the details we receive from reading the story show the reader several things about mr leonard  the first point which is given to us shows us that mrleonard is a strict man  however we also read that mrleonard has a softer side to him which he does not show when he works as a hall monitor  however as the story progresses we continue to show that mrleonard cares about what happens to paul  at the end of the story we see the reason why mr leonard cares about paul  mrleonard does not want what happened to him also happen to paul as mrleonard flunked out of college because he could not read just like paul
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard is shocking paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever as we come to find out in paragraph 38 it also gives paul a way to help mr leonard becuase paul finds out that mr leonard has troubles reading too paul starts training mr leonard after he finds out all the information paragraph 46 this brings the two closer together as friends since paul can relate to mr leonard paragraph 45
he finds out mrleonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm
mr leonard couldnt read either and he couldnt get very far in his life so the narrator has to try harder to accomplish his goals
the effects on paul was that he didnt know that mr leonard was like that in collage
paul can kinda find himself in mrleonard and wants to find more out about him
he want on doing what
when paul learns about mr leonards past he starts to feel as if he will also be able to go on and have some great achievements in his life he never thought that he would be able to go to college but the story of mr leonard shows him that anything is possible if you try your best at everything you do
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard gives insight into mr leeonards life paul sees why mr leonard sympathized with him since they both have a similar problem
he felt very embarraresed about this situation because the college that he went to turned out to be a disaster he was very ashamed and did not want to tell anyone that his scholarship got taken away alone them telling him that his grades did not matter and also he found out that he needed to be tutored
the effect that paul has when he finds the background information on mrleonard is that he is shocked excited he also felt closer and more relatable
i think paul is shocked too find out that mr leonard broke records he asked questions about it and seemed very interested
as paul learns of mr leonards past he is a bit moved he realizes though he is becoming good at hurdles he needs to learn to read so he doesnt become like mr leonard he also realizes then that education comes before athletics paul can relate to all of this because he is in that current situation in 45 it says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew paul then decides that mr leonard has done him a favor and has helped him reach a goal to excel at something this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him line 48 paul realizes that he needs to excel in academics now and help mr leonard in the process
when paul discovers that mr leonard can not read very well he probably feels a lot more relaxed  he knew he didnt have to prove anything to him  mr leonard understood where paul was coming from  it gave him comfort but paul still wanted to make mr leonard proud
the background information surprised paul but also made him curious as to why he did not continue to break records when paul found out mr leonard also could not read paul knew the embarrassment mr leonard felt so he wanted to help him learn to read
it has a really deep effect on paul because he is starting to become a track star and he doesnt want to go down the same path as mr leonard paul also helps mr leonard out with his reading at the end of the passage
the background information has more so of a good effect on paul from finding out that mr leonard was a track star and couldnt read probably made paul feel as if he can do almost anything it also probably made paul want to read because mr leonard said no other college wanted a runner who couldnt read so hopefully that put some type of effort into paul
paul gets to know mr lwonard better throughout the story i feel like they had a lot in common so they got along well together they both didnt know how to read and they both could jump hurdles i think that paul felt like he wasnt an outcast any more becuase he found someone that was like him in so many ways i think he found a friend that day
paul cant read and so do to that its hard for him to do his work so he has bad grades and cant make any school sprots team but mrleonard could help him
mrleonards background information has alot of impact on paul mainly because paul is facing the same problem mr leonard explains to him that he can be a good athlete but school is important to through the teachers past paul has started to open his eyes
mr leonard was a great track athelet when he was in college there was one problem he also couldnt read he had broken many records in his college years he had got kicked out of college becuase he couldnt read mr leonard had lost all of his scholarships and flucked out paul was thinking about that could be him he was trying to keep this all away from paul so that he wouldnt start to think that he could also be kicked from school becuase nobody wants a runner who cant read
paul knows what its like to not be able to read so he feels empathy for mr leonard and decides to help him
the information makes paul realize that mr leonard needed help with schoolwork to he found out he was a good hurdeler but couldnt do college work and wanted to help him
the fact that mr leonard dropped out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldnt read really effects paul because he to cannot read very well
he ws shocked at first because he didnt think that mrleonard couldve ben a track star but then he is more understanding as he finds out that he couldnt read he is also inspired to help mrleonard with reading because he had helped paul with getting into track and wanted to help him back
the background information about mr leonard makes paul somewhat confused at first because he does not know why he would hide his past of being a track star after mr leonard tells paul the whole story paul is empathetic with mr leonards situation because he is in a similar situation and decides to help him with his past
paul feels like he is in mr leonards shoes when he was younger in the story paul statesthe emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me this gave paul motivation to achieve something for not only himself but mr leonard who was not able to achieve much in school
paul is very thankful towards mr leonard for helping him get faster paul says in the passage its time to start your training this is a way that paul can help mr leonard on his reading and to repay him for what he done for him the background information helps paul realize that not everyone is the same and that he isnt the only person that cant read mr leonard gave paul some confidence
when paul figures out that mr leonard was a great athlete in high school and in college but did poorly academicly it encouraged him to try his best paul found out that mr leonard was one of the best hurdlers but when he lost his scholarship because he couldnt read no other school wanted him even though he was one of the best this showed paul that even though you could be one of the best at a sport it doesnt matter if you dont have the grades
the effect that the background information about mr leonard had on paul was great for paul and mr leonard  paul realized that he could do something he never thought of doing with the help of mr leonard  paul wanted to help mr leonard just like mr leonard helped him
the background information makes paul relate more to mr leonard paul had felt the embarassment that mr leonard had felt such as when paul was asked to come up to the front of the class to read paul realised that his life was a flashback for mr leonard and his difficult school life
when mr leonard hands paul the url and paul looks him up he realizes something important mr leonard and paul had something in common they both struggled with reading mr leonard saw an opportunity to help paul achieve his goals and he took that opportunity     obviously when mr leonard looked at paul he saw himself as a child he remembered what it was like to be in his position so paul was blessed to have someone like him to help paul realizes that just because he is chosen last for teams and he is unable to read doesnt mean he is unable to do other important things mr leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help paul so he could achieve his dreams
that mr leonard want to college and run track and field and that he should coach it
when paul finds out that mr leonard was a runner also he is very surprised paul first wants to know why mr leonard did not tell him about it why didnt you tell me about this paul knows exactly what mr leonard went through because he is going through the same thing paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he cant read the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me paul feels bad for mr leonard and wants to help him
after mr leonard helps paul become a great runner he went and talked to the rack coach he soon found out that mr leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it the effect of learning mr leonard was a great runner was that he really knew what he was doing and taught paul very well paul also learned that without education its hard to keep your dreams alive if mr leonard would have known to read he could have made even more records to beat
while training with mr leonard paul learns more about him and his past paul learns that mr leonard is not just a hall monitor in fact mr leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship paul also learns that mr leonard wasnt the best student and eventually flunked ou tof college because of his grades      as mr leonard is telling paul about his past paul understands the feelings of embarassment and was empathetic towards mr leonard paul is in a similar situation as mr leonard however paul recieves helps from the schools reading center paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr leonard like mr leonard helped him
he learns that paul is a good kid that can pick things up quick so he help him by learning one thing so that he can learn how to read better
when paul recieves information about mr leonard he is surprised that mr leonard never mentioned it to him he was somewhat in awe of mr leonard for his achievements and even more so for his will to help people like him
it suprises paul and makes him want to work harder and makes him sympathetic  in the last paragraph paul wants mr leonard to start training  paul also is a little confused on how mr leonard didnt make it as a runner  in paragraph 43 paul mentions that mr leonard went to colleage
the effect that background information has on paul is it made him want to help mr leonard learn to read and for him to never give up after paul found out about mr leonard he remembered how embarrassed he always feels because he cannot read paul feels like he relates to mr leonard in that way because they both have obstacles they need to overcome paul now understands and wants to help mr leonard learn to read also mr leonards background has taught paul to never give up learning because he can overcome it and become successful
the background effects paul because paul had no idea he was learning from a champion they both shared something and helped eachother all the way through
the background information presented about mr leonard is effective in the fact that paul can realize his own true potential      in the story paul not only learns about mr leonards past as a track star but also about his stuggles with learning this information motivates paul because he realizes that he has more opprotunities than mr leonard ever did and that even though mr leonard was a good athlete his school work was more important grades really do matter      this information also helps paul realize that mr leonard and him share a connection through this connection they can both help each other out
the background information the reader gets effected paul by motivating him he felt as if everyone has a strong point and that everyone deserves help in something no matter what it is also it makes him feel like everything gets better with practice
the effect that background information about mr leonard was a shock to him mr leonard never did think that paul would do research about him from his past from the story it says he looked at me quizzically then smiled sadly at the image on the page mr leonard was very speechless because what paul showed him brought back a big memory of mr leonard
the backround information had a big effect on paul  paul felt more comfortable an he understood mr leonard more after he found out the information
paul was suprized at what mr leonard has acomplished in college even though he flunked out
he was a good track runner in his day
pau obey leonard so that is why he listenings to him alot and look up to leonard
he learns that mr leanard was a great track runner for his college that he even broke records paul feels more conected to mr leonard because he too cant read
both mr leonard and paul were not very good students in school mrleonard was amazying in track but since he did not get good grades in class he lost he scholarship and flunked out of school paul is not very good in class either when mrleonard helps him learn how to jump hurtles good he had him go out for the boy track them in a way they are exactly the same
when paul is told to look up mr leonard he finds out that he was a track star and was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals  paul also finds out that mr leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldnt read  paul sees that hes not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read  mr leonard is very supportive and paul is no longer embarrased about his situation
the background effects paul by slowly showing him that he is being taught by one of the greats and he can over come his objectives
paul finds out that mr leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals yet he had to drop out because of his lack of intellegence this helps paul to connect more to his coach and want to work hard for mr leonard and have mr leonard work hard for him
the information that paul finds out about mr leonard is the he used to be an amazing college athlete who broke many records he found this out by typing in the url that the track coach had given him when he saw what a great athlete mr leonard was he confronted him about it when he questioned mr leonard about his athletic career he also found out that mr leonard flunked out of college because he struggled in school mainly because he could not read thats when eveythign clicked for paul he understood why mr leonard was excited about paul going to the learning center why he wanted to help him run hurdles why he asked him his name and paul knew how he could help mr leonard in return just like mr leonard had helped paul jump his hurdles he was going to return the favor
paul discovers that mr leonard had once ran track at a college level  mr leonard raced his way to several records then but paul didnt know why mr leonard had quit paul is motivated by mr leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports
paul seems to be compassionate with mr leonard in the story as he finds out mr leonard could not read either mr leonard explained how he had to rely on his friends for homework help and paul immediately felt empathy towards him
paul is surprised to learn that mr leonard was a star in college in hurdling and that he had won 400 titlesit makes paul compare himself to leonard since they were having the same kind of problems in lifeit makes paul want to struggle hard and believe he can achieve much in life despite the fact that he was not good academically
because mr leonards words were all too familiar to the narriator
the background information on mr leonard is very important because it explains why mr leonard is trying to make sure paul can get better at being aan athelete
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to paul the feelings of embarrassment when paul was called upon to read aloud or when  he didnt know an answer everyone else knew
when paul found out mr leonard was a track star and a good athlete in college but lost his scholarship because he was not a good student paul started to relate to mr leornard he felt like they had the same flaws and problems mr leonard helped paul excel in track and jumping hurdles and paul felt as if it was only fair if he helped mr leonard to read because paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed to read aloud in front of people
he feels sorry for paul for having struggles with reading because my leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read he did not want paul to go through the same expierience he did with being so talented but the difficulties with reading held him back from being able to do what he was good at
paul gets on the computer and finds out htat mr leonard has many track records from when he went to school and wonders why he is a hall monitor and why mr leonard didnt tell him about his records
paul is stunned on how good mr leonard did on his track and feild team but is also wondering why he gave it up
at first paul just sees mr leonard as the hall monitor in his school then when the track coach tells him to search the hall monitor on a track and feild website he finds out that mr leonard was a running star when he was young and also by asking mr leonard he finds out that he cannot read just like paul it gives paul a whole new perspective on mr leonard because he then understands that the reason mr leonard is helping him is that he was just like paul at that age and he can relate to him
the background information had a negative effect on paul paul saw that he was an amazing track runner but now hes just a hall monitor what happened to his big chance in a good carer so it kinda gave paul a loss in hope for sucess
paul finds out that mr leonard was a great athlete in college and that he had broken many track records while winning nationals so paul then knew that he had been coached by a great athlete he then finds out that mr leonard wasnt such a good student and that he flunked out of college this reminded him of himself he was good at running but not too good at school after finding that out he wants to help mr leonard how to read just like mr leonard taught him how to do hurdles
the background information that paul finds about mr leonard make him feel closer to him as a person he understands his feelings and he understands his past because he has been through things similar to what mr leonard has experienced
the highschool trach coach handed paul a url for the internet to visit  paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to mr leonard  the url happened to be about mr leonards past  he happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman but then he flunked out of college  this forms a unique bond between paul and mr leonard because they both struggle with school and reading  at the end paul says its time to start your trainingparagraph 46  this shows that paul is grateful for mr leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel  in return paul is willing to teach mr leonard how to read
he found out that mr lenoard is not doing well in some things he did not go to college thinking that he would flunk it so that is the reason why
the coach gives paul a website to go to on the website he finds out about mrleonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles the next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off he simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read this inspired paul knowing that mr leonard took the time out of his day to help him thats why paul is hepling him learn to read
the first information that paul learns about mr leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving the effect of this information is that when mr leonard coaches paul in track paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when mr leonard tells him to do something later paul learns that mr leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader pauls learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and mr leonard are not all that different paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to mr leonard pauls newfound knowledge of mrleonards background evokes this generosity
paul realizes that mr leonard is a lot like him  they both cant read but are willing to try and get better at anything  at the end of the story paul tells mr leonard its time to start your training
mrleonard was a track star back in his daypaul whats to be goood at something in his life like mr leonard
i think that paul can really do what he want if he just set his mind to it and he can be anything he want but i alsothink he can be a runer
when paul reads background information on mr leonard he is shocked to see that he had won the 400 meter hurdles and broke records he wondered why mr leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place
the effect is embarrassment and and sadness here are details from the story the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew
paul relizes that he is not alone and has a coach who delt with the same things as he currently is paul is suprised when he first finds out and then when mr leonard tells him more of the story he understands why he is helping him
when paul recieves the informaton on mr leonard he feels as if he is in the same boat as him paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before in the story paul is confused when mr leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes but after he finds out that he cant read he wants to start training mr leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for paul during the track season
paul learned beckground information about mr leonard that was revelant to his own life paul learned that mr leonard was a great hurdler but was awful at reading paul also learned that mr leonard failed out of college for not being able to read paul knows that he is not very good at reading and being in this remedial program will help him learn to read better and maybe one day he will go to college for hurdles but not fail out
it makes paul curious you can tell this because he asks mr leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him another reason you can tell it makes him curious is because paul asks other questions about mrleonards past like what happened
it makes paul ask why mr leonard did not tell him this
paul feels bad for mr leonard because he has the same problems as him at the end of the story paul says to mr leonard indirectly that he was going to help him learn how to read
paul sees that mr leonard was an amazing athlete but his athletic career was takin away from him because of his grades mr leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college paul is intrigued to hear this and it makes him want to do better as a student and as an athlete
before paul knew of mr leonards disability he had just thought of him as some one who didnt know what they were talking about that mr leonard didnt really understand who paul was and didnt understnd pauls disabilities            after reading the passage paul realized that mr leonard had full empathy for him and uunderstood paul to the fullest mr leonard then had a bigger empact on paul because now paul sees what he can becomeand what he has to do to become whatver it is that he wants
i believe that the information that he learns about mr leonard makes him have a very close connection with him he realizes that his life is a lot like mr leonards life but that he has a chance to change his future
the effect the background information has on paul is that he will probly work harder on his reading so he wouldnt end up like mr leonard and loose his scholarship
because he wamted to learn evreything that was going on with him to get a better feel
because things where different in college and evrything
when mrleonard staredmiddle school he new mrpaul as a hall monitor whoes job it was to keep students movieung along form on class to another mrleonard cant reade ether
paul finds reading hard so does mr leonard when paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star but couldnt read this reminded him that he couldnt read if mr leonard could read but can be a track star then paul can work on his reading and become a track star mr leonards history shows pail what he can become
it gives paul modivation to excel in the hurdles and also to help mr leonard in areas he struggled with to  the background information also gives paul a feeling of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or when he didnt know an answer everyone else knew  he then realizes that mr leonard is helping him to excel in something to make him feel important
when paul got background information on mr leonard that effected paul to feel like he isnt the only one that has a reading problem at school and couldnt read that well and it also made him feel just like mr leonard because he was always pick lasted for a team so he also started training and got really good at sports so he wasnt chosed last anymore
when paul finds out the background information about mr leonard paul seems more interested in him paul asks questions about his past and why he didnt go further with his talent when mr leonard tells paul about his past it shows a connection between the two and shows paul that he can be successful in life
paul is very shocked by what he sees on the internet about mr leonard it also encourages paul to good in track and in school now because he has seen what happened to mr leonard by not being able to read
the background information on mr leonard effects paul by helping paul recognize that mr leonard never learned well and he needed learning centers mr leonard was a good athlete but he was never an exceptional learner through this paul gained the need to help mr leonard learn
the effects it has on paul are sad he didnt know that mr leonard failed college mr leonard felt ashamed which made paul want to do good
mrleonard and paul both had something in common they had a hard time reading when paul ran into mrleonard in the hallway he asked for his pass and asked were he was going paul told mrleonard he was going to learn to read because he couldnt mrleonard eased up and let him go through as if he knew what he was talking about now mrleonard is their track couch and paul is very good now just like mrleonard was
he is shocked and cant believe he was in college for hurdles also he didnt know why he didnt tell him before why didnt you tell me about this before
that mr leonard was a collage track super star and he broke records it had a negative and a postive effect on paul it put him down that the man who had been helping him had not told him that he was a track star but it also helped him when he confronted mr leonard about it
when mr leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him because he was a good coach to him paul felt the same when mr leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track
it makes paul seem more able to read by using an adult who has trouble reading as another example it also makes paul feel less inferior to mr leonard at the end of the story paul makes a statement that begins the idea that paul then helps mr leonard with reading
it show paul that people aare like him so there is more than a select few it can be paul being just like mr leonard so if he becomes a better reader he can go on to college and do great things
i believe that the background information paul receives effects paul in such a way that he feels inspired encouraged and feels like the sky is his limit
after paul finds out that mr leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that mr leonard flunked out of college because he could not read this inspired paul to help mr leonard after paul and mr leonard talked about mr leonards college accomplishments paul thought of an idea paul was going to go help teach mr leonard how to read since mr leonard helped paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic
when paul finds out the mr leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records he soon finds out that mr leonard also could not read just like paul this made paul think that mr leonard had helped him so now its time to return a favor and tell him to cmon its time to start his training as he walks towards the school
he discovers that mrleonard is is just like he is he relizes that not beening able to read is not a bad thing
mr leonard was a good athlete but poor student his college work was harder than high school work so he lost his scolarship and dropped out he said the coach did not want a runner that could not read
he wants to be like mr leonard and be a track star he wants to be smart and able to read
in the story our narrator paul finds some background information on mr leaonard this information impacts paul greatly in the story his attitude and the way he sees things change completely     when paul had said i knew the wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read alouf or when i didnt know an answer everone else knew paul understands how mr leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people paul feels for mr leonard and he sympathizes for him     pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says its time to start your training now the paul realizes that mr leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant
when paul found out that mrleonard was a good track star and that he didnt go to college because he couldnt read it reminded paul of his self
paul realizes that mr leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense mr leonard also is not good at school like paul and wants to give paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for paul
the background information effects paul because it makes paul want to help mr leonard learn how to read when paul figured out that mr leonard was a track star during college by the url given to him by the track coach he acts suprised and decides to help mr leonard learn to read
paul most likely now understands why mr leonard is encouraging him to do the races and wants him to go to college and graduate
mr leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too
the background information about mrleonard effects paul by showing him and inspiring him with a story that is somewhat similar to his own he knows that mrleonard and himself have things incommon they are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles
paul understood better why mr leonard took care of paul when paul told mr leonard he couldnt read that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star with this back ground information paul felt more emotionally connected to mr leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life he felt like there was someone else out there and this man was just trying to help paul succeed at something
the background information has a big effect on paul it motivates paul to do even better since him and mr leonard had similar problems in school
the background information that mr leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him it would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track
the effect that background information has on paul is that he now feels connected to mr leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read
the information he finds about mr leonard effects him alot because he relizes how much they are alike to eachother they both have reading disabilities and he is trying to help him to get over that and not to affect him mr leonard gets him on the track and trains him because that is what he used to do and he wants to pass it on
paul feels sympathetic for mr leonard when he finds out that mr leonard can not read i suspect that this is because paul could not read very well paul states the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarassment when i was called when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew paul knows that this was the way that mr leonard felt in high school and college
he realizes the importance of working hard learning to read and doing well in school he handed the print out of the web page to mr leonard and ask him what happened to him and mr leonard told him his story at that moment paul realized that reading and graddes were important and mr leonard didnt want him to suffer the same way he did
i believe that gives paul the narrator and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to paul its someone he can look at and understand it gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others he is not alone it also tells paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading that is why i believe that it gives background information
paul sees that just because you cant do something right you can work hard to overcome any obstacle
mr leonard asking the narrator has set paul into the right frame of mind by knowing that life always has obstacles paul also relized that mr leonard was always there to help and making paul motivated to read everyone knows that reading is something you need to do not maybe want to do
paul realized that even though your not good at one thing that you cant be good at something else just like when paul talks about he knows the feeling of embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know an anwser everyone else knew paul realized mr leonard gave his time to help him excel at something and that its okay to not be good at something you just have to work at it harder
mr leonards past motivates paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at somethng suddenly i realized what i could do for him
the effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write
it reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like mr leonard mr leonard couldnt read and flunked out of college and since paul cant read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college
he finds out that mr leonard and paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self
paul finds out that mr leonard was a great track star yet flunked out of collage because he couldnt read no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
he got upset cause he never told him
before learning of mr leonards background paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read  once mr leonard gets paul running track and builds his confidence paul finds out that mr leonard use to be a track star  when paul questions mr leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that mr leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year due to reading and homework troubles  paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does  the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me  he also learns that just because he struggles in school doesnt mean he cant succeed with his dreams he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor
paul actually wants to do this now that he knows mr leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college an example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me  i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him
the efect that mr leonards has on paul is that he is in the same position as mr leonard and he does not want to take the same route as mr leonard and ruin the chances of having something good going for him
when paul finds out about mr leonards past he is interested and wants to know more once mr leonard explains what happens paul understands the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me is what went through his mind this encourages paul to help mr leonard learn to read
paul learned that mr leonard was a track star who also couldnt read his inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him paul who also couldnt read felt close to mr leonard he felt empathetic he understood the hall monitors emotions completely he could identify with the embarrassment he felt     mr leonard had given paul hope he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively eventually paul was able to join the track team it had given him the chance to excel at something like never before after hearing mr leonards story he felt as though he should give back after the story ends its clear that paul is helping to teach mr leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself
he was amazed by his accomplishments and wondered why even though he went to college he had problems with school work
mr leonard feel s that paul is just like him in ways  he couldnt read so he had to flunk out of college and he didnt want that to happen to paul
it in a way gives him confirmation on why mrleonard did the things that he did and why he had taken a liking to paul becasue when mrleonard was younger he was alot like paul so i can only figure that it helpred mrleonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in paul
it makes him feel discouraged and angry paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do
the effect on the background that he has on paul was because on lines 3 and 4 mrleonard talks and says hey my friend where do you think you are going then paul says the learning center then he tells him that he cant read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story
the background information paul learned form mrleonard made a diffrence once paul learns that mrleonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked mrleonard why then mrleonard explains everything just like paul he had also been good in hurdles and  had trouble reading though it didnt seem like a problem then his college scouts told him that they werent important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarshipthis made paul think of all what mrleonard had done for him since he was going through the same he was good in a sport but not so good as a student then realizes mrleonard does this to help other students
mr leonard was a big time runner in his college days but was unable to learn anything while in college as a result mr leonard was thrown out of college and no other school would take him because even though he was a good runner he wasnt well educated which was not tolerated this is seen as a big incouragement for paul seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education that he can accomplish things when he tries also paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make mr leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what leonard couldnt
paul was effected by mrleonard because paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed for example in the story the author stated  i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i idint know an answer everyone else knew this statement shows paul understood how mrleonard felt therefore paul was effected by mrleonard background
paul is concerned about mr leonard that why didnt he finish college and why didnt he tell him that he was a star athlete on hurdlers
paul likes to incourage people to do better
as long as paul had known mr leonard he was a hall monitor this made paul respectful and obedient to him that not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics the next peice of backround information paul learns about mr leonard is that mr leonard was a track star this simply increases the respect he has for him in the story paul didnt appear to be upset that mr leonard hadnt told him about his past he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more the last peice of information paul learned about mr leonard was that he couldnt read many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate but paul can simpathize he understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps mr leonard to read
during this story paul learns backround information about mr leonard that really surprises him this information shows paul that even though you may be good at something for example a sport school work and your education always comes first now paul will really work hard on learning how to read he doesnt want to let mr leonard or himself down
the background information has a huge affect on paul because mr leonard was trying to help paul be as good as he was at hurdles  mr leonard wanted someone that never did anything and was working hard for his gradeswhen mr leonard found out that paul was learning how to read mr leonard took that as an oppurtunity to help paul achieve in something that he once had
paul doesnt feel as embarrased to know his coach struggled with reading too
paul was curious as to why mrleonard had never mentioned of his running past he seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name when paul found out the reasoning that mrleonard had for what happened he felt for  him paul knew exactly how mrleonard felt the embarrasment the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer he could truly relate to him      it occured to paul that in the same way mrleonard had approached him and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself he was gonna help mrleonard do the same paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills and while helping him it would also improve pauls reading skills
when paul realizes that his everyday coach and hall monitor was truely a great college track runner paul was stunned paul had been interacting with mr leaonard everyday without knowing his true background paul is surprised about mr leonards background and then goes on to ask him various questions
the background information that paul finds about mr leonard gives him a curious feeling he wondered what happened to mr leonard as it turns out mr leonard cant read which is the same problem that paul had which caused the two to meet since mr leonard taught paul how to run hurdles paul felt he should teach mr leonard how to read
the effect on paul from raeding mrs leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it
he it makes him like mr leonard more when he finds out that he was a track star and very good he shows the coach more understanding as to why he made him do track when he learns that mr leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him
it has a positive effect on paul it makes him want to strive to be better than mr leonard
the information he fount on mr leonard had a good effect on paul because he didnt know mrleonard ran track in his freshmen year in college he was inspired by it and the fact that mrleonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education
paul feels a relation between himself and mr leonard they both cant or have trouble reading plus they are both track hurdlers too therefore when he paul learns of mr leonards past he feels a relation between them
he isnt really affected by it  he was just curious as to why mr leonard didnt tell him about it  paul may have been a little hurt but i dont think it really surprised him that much  paul was understanding when mr leonard told him why and wanted to help him
paul is very impressed about what he hears about mr leonard the next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and mr leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away
mr leonard did a great job when he was on track but became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read he later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read he explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up and he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs
paul finds out about mr leonards past from the high school track coach  he is surprised by the janitors previous experiences  you know that he surprised because he confronts him about it  when he finds out grabowski can not read he feels the need to help he shows that by tellinghim it is time to start training you
it surprises him but he is more determined to help mr leonard and do better himself paul sees the person that helped him not do so well in school so it would shock and surprise him he is more determined to help mr leonard out since mr leonard helped him out he knows what mr leonard feels like since he has gone through some of the same situations
pauls more aprehensive to learn hes confident that learning to read will be easier now because if tracks easy then so is school and it theres people like him then hes not so ashamed
paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete when he found out that mr leonard also couldnt read he understood how his coach felt he also felt that he owed mr leonard something for teaching him how to run hurdles so he offered to help the coach with reading
paul wants to learn how to run faster for the high school track and he run every day with mr leonard and mrleonard wants to lit him tran for high school because he will be good and faster they another kis mrleonard shows the boy something how to stay and shape
paul could be good at sport than mr leonard
when paul does a background check on mr leonard he realizes that mr leonard was the same way he was back in school he wants to make something of himself instead of being a hall monitor in a middle school someday
i believe that when paul knows the truth about mr leonard he is more motivated to start learning and willing to work harder on hurdling his relationship with mr leonard also increases and he comes to respect him
well mr leonard was paul teacher and everybody would always make fun of him because he wasnt good at sports or anything so his teacher decides to put me in sports like basketball and track he would like jump over the hurdles like it wasnt nothing and his coach was like nice job kid i hope you do good when your playing baskaetball so he lefted english to go to a learning center to get helped and work out for the basketball and track and everybody that was in the school were like good job kid im proud of you so then the kids were jealous and mad because he would do something right that his coach would tell me
the background information helps paul acheive his goals paul took his training lessons from mr leonard and became good at doing the hurdles in track even though paul couldnt read he still wanted to do few things to accomplish in his life he may of been going into the learning center but that doesnt stop you from doing well in other acheivements paul learned alot from his coach and taught him how to be better than what paul had realized he was
the background that mr leonard gives paul makes paul think that they are the same because they both cant read mr leonard and paul are both good at hurddles
paul was surprised and kind of angry that mr leonard didnt tell him sooner
the narrator is surprised at the information he never expected that mr leonard was a track star
the background information that paul finds out helps paul know that he can become an athlete too it also proves that paul can go to college even though he cant read mr leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldnt read
when paul recieved the background information he had questions for mr leonard paul wondered
because paul learned that mr leonard had been a great athlete but flunked out of school because he was unable to read he had common ground built with mr leonard that knowledge of what had happened to mr leonard impacted paul to start working harder because mr leonard had told him how hard things got after high school
mrlenorad lets paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read this effects paul because he is in the same situation at school because he cant read as well but mr leonards lets him know thats not a problem because paul has help that mr leonard didnt have
paul comes to find out that mrleonard and himself are the same they both struggle with reading in high school and in high school is when they found that they love track
paul cant believe that mr leonard was a college tract runner he wants to know why mr leonard didnt tell him
during the story when paul confronts mr leonard about his past it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated  mr leonard too could not read  the embarassing emotions that mr leonard felt were all too familiar to paul and gave him a sense of not being alone  the effect that this information had on paul was substantial because it motivated paul to become a better reader and athlete not just for his sake but for mr leonards sake as well
teh background information on mr leonard effects paul by making him realize that other people also share his troubles of not being able to read even great athletes like mr leonard
the imformation that paul get on mr leonard helps him understand why mr leonard is helping him with track
he wants him to be as good as he can be for the sport that he is going out for and learn as much as he can to be prepared for what he is about to get into he is going out for training to get as good as he can at it
when paul learns of mr loenards past it might have had a positive emotional affect on himself paul says in the story that he is a select few who are in the remedial reading program and from this he may feel embarrased and have low selfesteem plus when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesnt help his esteem either but when learns of mr leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school this may motivate paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what mr leonard could not accomplish
paul realizes mr leonard and him are similiar paul realizes he doesnt have to be the last person picked in the gym anymore and he can achieve something and there is hope that he will learn to read and become a great athlete
he realizes that even if he is not good in school he can still succeed in life he finds that he just has to find something he is good at stick with it and succeed
the effect that it has on paul is that he now feels the desire to help out mr leonard since he had takent the time to help him out  in the story it says this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him  this show how he felt the need to return the help
leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times he never gave up paul learned alot from him and he used that in life
mr leonards background information gives paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read it also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since mr leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school when paul realizes how much mr leonard and him have in common it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life     mr leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard he got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run he soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship no college would take him after that because they didnt want a runner that couldnt read
he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state
paul found out that mr leonard had starred in college track he broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles however he found out that mr leonard had flunked out of college paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center mr leonards school had not had a learning center so he never got help with his reading problems he had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems this makes paul appreciate his tutoring
when paul realizes that mr leonard was a good runner but bad reader he realizes they are alike it makes paul want to help mr leonard by teaching him to read and it makes mr leonard to help paul feel accepted by helping him with track it also motivates paul to do better in school so he wont end up flunking
mr leonards background information had an effect on paul because both mr leonard and paul had the same problem and motivation their problem was that both were not very strong at reading but their strengths hurdles is what brought the two together as friends since mr leonard had the motivation to teach paul hurdles and paul was willing to learn paul could become the new mr leonard athletically
he learns that mr leonard is very much like him in the sense that mr leonard isnt a good reader either  when mr leonard explains to paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track even though he was not that good in school  when he explained to paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college it helped paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal  with mr leonard showing paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles paul was able to apply mr leonards advice to his own life
the effect of the background information on paul is a good thing the background information makes paul open his eyes and realize what mr leonard was doing for him mr leonard did not know how to read and when he found out that paul did not know how to read he eased up on him mr leonard coaches paul how to do hurdles mr leonard sees himself in paul and knows it is a great thing for him
when paul recieves background information about mrleonard they become more familiar with eachother paul has an inferrior and shy complex as he first interacts with mrleonard he obeys the comands form his hall monitor but there was no relationship formed when mrleonard introduces himself as a concerned adult paul still looks up to him after a relationship is formed with common character traits and the two characters become on the same level of understanding
paul receives information about mr leonard after training with him for some time after receiving the information however paul now understands why mr leonard wants to help him mr leonard inspires him to do his best he sees that having the learning center and trying hard along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish he wants to overcome this task though
paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star as a college freshman however because mr leonard struggled with reading and academics he lost his scholarship and was forced to drop out of school the fact that mr leonard also struggles academically helps paul to relate to him it gives paul the confidence to embark on a friendship where he and mr leanard can help each other succeed
over the course of pauls encounters with mr leonard various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 1423 know what thatright i panted     the greatest revealation however is made when paul obtains information on mr leonard from his coach in paragraphs 3233  visit this sitewith the team this makes paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses
paul gets backgroung information abuot mr leonard and effects paul because he didnt know that leonard was a hurdle athlete he said he couldnt read and that he flunked college because of it leonard got all emotional and paul knew how he felt so he said cmon mr leonard its time to start your training paul wanted to help mr leonard and make him feel better
paul realizes that mr leonard was just like him and he acomplished something great it inspires him by showing him that you can accomplish many things even if you arent great at others
paul finds the background information very interresting to him paul seems to feel for mr leonard paul works hard to and gets help after school also going to the learning center for help      mr leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here pauls age they didnt have a learning center for him mr leonard had to go to his friends for help     this showed paul that he can do it if mr leonard did he will just have to work hard at school work and track
the background information helps paul understand why mr leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program paul is then very empathetic toward mr leonard and is probably going to try teach him
the background information about mr leonard has an astronomical effect on paul paul found a new form of respect for mr leonard after reading the background information which can be infered by pauls astonishment of mr leonards accomplishments paul now looks up to mr leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles when paul learns of mr leonards disability he wants to help mr leonard in the same way that mr leonard helped him
the backround check on mr leonard was very suprising to paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles paul went to his computer and went to the schools track and feild website and looked at the history about hurdles and  he saw mr leonard name and it said that he got a full time scholorship for college for hurdles
paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that mr leonard had a reading problem in school paul was also surprised that mr leonard used to be such a fantastic athlete and wondered why he kept this information from him
it was explaining that he was a well talented person who wanted to help another out with his talent when he wasnt doing good in school he was being helped by some tutors that was willing to help him so that he can keep his tallent going
mr leonards background information effects paul paul realizes he could be like mr leonard because neither of them ccan read proficently mr leonards background information helps paul understand that he is not the only one that cannot read and paul learns that he can excell at other things such as track and field
once paul hears why mrleonard college story he wanted to help him learn to read becuse mr leonard was going to help him get in shape
as the reader you learn that mr leonard was once a great track star when he was in highschool knowing this you can see why he wants to help out the young boy in the story then you also learn that he cannot read that well and that he flunked out of collage knowing this you can learn more about mr leonard in the fact that he is embarrased with himself and doesnt want the same for the kid
the effect it has on paul is that he was surprised that the monitor was almost something in life but crushed because of something important he felt lied too just a little bit
the background information about mr leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college what is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership why was because he didnt know how to read
that he was a good athlete but not a good student mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals
that paul went to try how hurlding and mr leonard said to come on back tomorrow  mrleonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because mr leonard  was a good college track starbut mr leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college so i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
paul is affected by the information he finds out about mr leonard in many way for starters paul is somewhat astonished to find that like him mr leonard cant read paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read also paul can sympatize with mr leonard which will make their relationship stronger
the effect mr leonards background information has on paul is that paul now feels more connected to him i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer anyone else knew this quote from the story shows that paul can relate to mr leonard and that it has brought them closer together paul also felt the need to help mr leonard with reading as he had helped paul with track and field from this quote this man had given his time to help me excel at someting suddenly i realized what i could do for him
he realizes that he is the same way when it comes to school he realizes also that he doesnt need to be booksmart to do things in life
paul did not know that mr leonard did not know how to read now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read
it makes paul a better student and after he hears the story from mr leonard he works even harder and trys harder so that he doesnt let that happen to him
the eefect the background information that paul found on mr leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldnt read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read
that why would he be teaching him how to run the hurdles if he was so good and also to ask him why he is the hall monitor for the school not a track star person
paul realizes that he and mr leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought when paul discovers that mr leonard was a college track star paul becomes more motivated this is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team      when paul soon discovered that mr leonard cant read and flunked out of college he is motivated to begin mr leonards training
the background information paul discover schanges his outlook on mr leonard it pushes him to succeed and show mr leonard how great he can really be
the effect it has on paul was that it made him curious to know why mrleonard didnt tell him about it and why he quit
it has a huge effect on paul and mr leonard when he first shows mr leonard the url it makes a big impact on  him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read     once mr leonard told paul that that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school
paul could relate to what mr leonard went through paul knew how it felt to not be able to read and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle this is shown when it says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me     the learned information also shows paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative he not only overcomes his inability to read but finds an outlet and takes leadership in both in running track he gets on the high school team and in reading is able to help mr leonard learn as well
the information he learned gave him comfidence to help mr leonard just as mr leonard helped him  paul tells mr leonard it is time to start training meaning its time to start learning  paul also now could relate to mr leonard better
during the story paul gets some backround information about mr leonard paul learns that mr leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals paul learns mr leonard was an outstanding athlete but not a good student as the story continues paul learns that mr leonard could not read and then flunked out of school mr leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed
the background information that they had on him was things about when he was in college and he had bad grades and he couldnt go out for scouts
paul was suprized that mrleonard never told him about his pastwhy didnt you tell me about this he also seemed amazed by everything that mrleonard had doneyou were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinalsyou broke records
the background information paul finds on mr leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler also paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports on the other hand paul was sympathetic for mr leonard for what had happened to him for example paul asked  well what happened after that that shows he was curious and cared
the background infromation shows paul that he can learn how to read that if he puts his mind to something he can succsed if he tries
its the fact that they both cant read
paul finds out that mr leonard was an old track runner and that he broke many records when paul confronts him he finds out mr leonard cant read like himself
the background information has an effect of paul because he gets to know a person better and is therefore not the only one who cant read and feels better
after paul researched the background information about mrleonard he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend this is evident when paul asked why mrleonard had not told him about his acomplishments this is also evident from the excited way the say that you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nations you broke records
there is a simlairies that mrleonard shaw potential in paul and wanted paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so paul wouldnt end up like mr leonard
the background information paul found about mr leonard made him empathetic because he knew exactly how he felt but also he became motiveated to help mr leonard just as he had helped him  with hurdles suddenly i realized what i could do for him
paul was asked to gym
seeing that mr leonard had been capable of not only going to college but braking records in the 400 meter hurdles influenced him paul seen that mr leonard accomplished amazing things in life and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldnt read influenced paul even more paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing mr leonard had flunked out of college because he couldnt read
the narrator is in a way just like mr leonard he will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college
paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor mr leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete he also wondered why he doesnt run anymore so he went to confront mr leonard about it and asked well what happened after that and he said  i lost my scholarship and flunked
the background information of mr leonard effects paul in a positive way when paul finds out the mr leonard was also a great hurdler but flunked out of college for not being able to read it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles paul is a little shocked when mr leonard says that he was a hurdler in college but could not read paul shows this in paragraph 43 paul could relate to what mr leonard went through and he ends up helping mr leonard learn to read
paul receives a url containing information about mr leonards past as a track star this shocked paul at first and made him wonder why mr leonard kept this from him he then realized that mr leonard was unable to read just like himself this made paul feel like he isnt such a failure at life after all because he is now good at track and field as well as has the ability to use a learning center to learn how to read
it gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow
paul found out that mr leonard was a very good hurdler mr leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals mr leonard even broke records when mr leonard told paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading
paul is affected in that learing mr leonards background has made him more determined to work hard on reading and the new sport he is in this also gave him better understanding of mr leonards life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity and paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way mr leonard helped him with hurrdles
an example from the story that tells paul some background information about mr leonard is when paul gets on the track and field website thats says mr leonard was a college track star it surprises paul and also lets him know mr leonard was a good runner also it inspires paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete
paul is surprised about the background information  he was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records  he wants to know more about him
the information that mr leonard provides has a great effect on paul as he is telling paul about his past it reminds him of himself because he is the same way and wants to change his ways and bcome an achiever in life he also wants to make mr leonard happy by doing track and field
when mr leonard explained to paul that he had also struggled in life with reading disablities then paul relized that he was suffering the same thing and why he has to go to the learning center to learn how to read mr leonard didnt have much of a way to learn how to read in school he had no learning centers but in collage he had tutors that ried to help him but the collage was to hard so he dropped out when told that to paul the young man noticed that it sounded just like him
i think this affected paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher little did paul know but mr leonard was a start track runner this background information that paul gets helps him understand why mr leonard is helping him this also makes him want to help with his reading problems at the end of the story paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read
the effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of mr leonard because he finds out he cant read either so he can understand how mr leonard feels
paul feels like since mr lenard has helped him become a track and field runner he should help mr lenard learn how to read paul does this by saying that mr lenard has some training to do paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on mr lenard he was also empathetic for mr lenard he wanted to help mr lenard like mr lenard helped him
paul related better to mr leonard after he found out that mr leonard wasnt very good at reading either
the backround story you get on mr leonard is that he was a good athlete but he was not a good student college scouts told mr leonard that his grades didnt matter and that they would have tutors for him but since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school he could not handle the more difficult college work this caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship      paul could relate to mr leonards emotions because he too had difficulties wtih school work at the end of the stroy paul tells mr leonard its time for him to start his training this implys that since mr leonard has helped paul with his running that paul will help mr leonard to learn to read
the effect that the background of mr leonard has on paul is the they are almost alike
paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with mr leonard about reading difficulties he also most likely understands that had he been born in an earlier age he may have had the same college experience as mr leonard paul is also influenced by the background information to help mr leonard train in reading which is pauls way of showing gratitude and appreciation for mr leonards efforts to train paul in track and field
mr leonards background information had a large effect on paul mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read and the school work was too challenging no school would take a runner who couldnt read after paul learned all of this information he felt empathy for mr leonard paul had walked in his shoes somewhat he knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer paul was very grateful and shocked that mr leonard gave up his time to help paul succeed and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication
that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show mr leonard he can do it
the effect it had on paul was that basically he could be a great athlete but he would have to have his grades right alsohe was a college freshmen who won the 40 meter hurdkes at nationals but he couldnt read
learning that mr leonard had trouble reading as well my paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didnt know the answer to and everyone else did now he realizes he isnt alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident
paul was shocked he did not know what to think
when he learns that mr leonard was a track star paul is slightly unhappy that he wasnt told he even asks mr leonard why he didnt tell paul he then feels like mr leonard is a kindred spirit when he says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me he feels empathy for mr leonard and that makes paul want to help him at the end of the story
at firsthe admires mrleonard he saw that he had been a very talented athlete and he wonders why he never told him about it when paul finds out mr leonard cant read he becomes sympathetic and wants to help him just as mr leonard helped paul with the hurldes
the effect of mr leonards background on paul is great  paul can connect himself to mr leonard because their backgrounds are similar
finding out about mr leonards past helps paul in realizing that he can do things he didnt know he could do seeing what happened to mr leonard helped paul fight through challenges in the end paul says cmon mr leonard its time to start your training
the effect the background information has on paul about mr leonard in the story is that paul has the same problems paul had but paul is getting help with it and paul never was interested in sports but mr leonard was and he was good at them too so since mr leonard helped paul paul would help him
the effect it has on paul is that hes going throught the same things as mr leonard went through for example when mr leonard was in high school he could read either and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin but as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability paul refers to this because he cant read either all in all mr leonard wants paul to succeed unlike he did mr leonard wants paul to do his best and do better then he did
paul begins to feel bad for mr leonard and sees that they are similar and so many different ways they both are not the best at reading but they both try to become better at it just as they try to become better athletes
paul finds background information on mr leonard from the website paul pulled the printout of mr leonard when he used to run mr leonard then smiled sadly the effect makes the reader wonder why mr leonard is sad and makes paul wonder why mr leonard didnt tell him about this before
when paul found out background information about mr leonard he was surprised since he found out that mr leonard was a great athlete but not a good student he felt good for learning to read since mr leonard said colleges did not want a runner who could not read he flunked out paul apperciated the fact that he knows how to read by knowing this fact about mr leonard
paul feels sorry for mr leonard because he understands and can relate to how he feels mr leonards past of feelings of embarrassment were pauls present life
paul was a guy who felt neglected and was always picked last and mr leonard picked up on it  he knows what it is like to feel embarrassed to not be able to do something because he flunked out of college  he motivated paul to do hurdles and showed him how they are obstacles in life he also found that he was not good at reading either so he was concerned and wanted to help
the stouy was about paul whns to be the beast
the effect after paul figured out about mr leonards past was really good for him because mr leonard had the same probolems with reading and his grades but back then it didnt matter what your grades were it was showing paul that if he put his mind to it and tried hard he could acomplish anything he set his mind to
paul is amazed at the achievments of mr leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent in line 40 paul asks well what happened after that this shows that at the time paul didnt understand why mr leonard didnt pursue track and field afterwards paul finds out that mr leonard is illiterate he becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle
the effect that the background information on mr leonard had on paul was he wanted to help he was confused on what happened since mr leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman mr leondard told him that he was a good athlete but not a good student he could not read and paul wanted to help he wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read because mr leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training
it didnt occured to the narrator at first when mr leonard asked him for his name but later the narrator realized that it was an odd question because mr leonard checked the narrators hall pass which had his name on it twice every week later the narrator found some information about mr leonard as a track player in college the narrator was curious about what had happened to mr leonard after his broken record as a college freshman mr leonard sheeplishly told the narrator that he flunked out the college because he couldnt read very well then the narrator realized that mr leonard asked for his name because he couldnt read the narrators hall pass
the information that paul gets is really familiar to him he is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like mr leonard is in paragraph 45 paul starts to change his mind about mr leonard
it makes paul want to know what happened and why he hadnt told him i think paul might have been upset because he had trust in him
when paul finds out that mr leonard was once a track star he was shocked to find out why he stoped doin track  it was becuase he was a bad student and dosent want paul to be one so hes helping him out
during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard the effect the background information has on paul encourages paul to continue to practice track and field and to try his hardest in school aftering hearing about mr leonards experience of being a freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and who had broke records and asking what had happened effected paul the most also after hearing that mr leonard had fluncked out of college after his freshman year because he had to rely on his friends to get him through school it encouraged paul to study his hardest and in his tutoring class so that he could be a track allstar some day in college but to be able to handle the rigorous school work that comes with college
the effect that the reader  paul gets when he finds out background information about mr leonard is that he is suprised that mr leonard never mentioned anything about the authors shows that he is suprised because the passage say that paul askes him why didnt he ever tell him anything about it
i distinguished myself from the masses by being one of a select few in the remedial reading prgram
after paul finds out what mrleonard went through about flunking out of college having everyone having to help him in school and barley passing by getting a tutor and no other school wants them to run for them because he cant read paul realizes that he can relate to him and he feels the same way it effects with his feeling becasue he feels embarrassed when hes called upon to read infrotn of other people but then he realized that he is going to work as hard as he can for mrleonard
the information about mr leonard being a top athlete as a freshman in college and setting records explains to paul why he is such a good coach to him on the track but later found information about mr leonard losing his scholarship and flunking out of college explains why mr leonard is so suspicious about why paul goes to the learning center
the background information inspires paul to do better because when mr leonard tell paul about his situation paul symisizes when him because he is in the same position
the background information showed paul why mr leonard was helping him train for track  also mr leonards past related to what paul is going through
when paul finds out that mr leonard went to college on a track schollarship but then failed out because he too could not read connects paul to his coach more paul realizes that he is not the only one who struggles with something and that he can accomplish great things in paragraph 45 paul explains how he knows and understands how his coach felt he now knows what he can do to help his coach as well
paul seems up for a challenge and is ready to start something with leonard he seems thrilled and excited to join this track team with leaonard and be against him
the effect that the backround information had on paul was exciting he finds it very surprising that mr leonard was such a remarkable athlete he says  you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals you broke records
the effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward mr leonard probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler it made him feel kind of good to know that mr leonard was a hurtler adn that mr leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this but then upon learning that mr leonard couldnt read it probably made paul feel kind of awed toward mr leonard because he was like him in those ways
paul realizes that mr leonard is like him becasue he cant read and is really good at track mr leonard does not want paul to not be able to read and be good at track he want paul to be able to read and be good at track
the background information about mr leonard is suprising to paul paul wonders why mr leonard didnt continue in track and field after that race he finds that mr leonard is a lot like him and he wants to help him learn how to read just like he helped paul how to run hurdles
the reader has a normal life with no extra activities and mr leonard chanes that by teaching him how to hurdle when the reader finds out why mr leonard left college is when he actually connects with mr leonard and wants train him in reading
because he was a college drop out
the information gave paul enthusiasm to do good because his coach did good to
paul feels imapthectic twords mrlenord her fells that they are one in the same because of him sharing
it shows paul that mr leonard was the same as paul he didint know how to read and he was only good at track when paul learns he cant read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach mr leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles
once paul receives the information about mr leonard he is encouraged almost dumbfounded paul is shocked because he cant believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker paul is proud of mr leonard but also confused as to why mr leonard did not go onto bigger and better things paul states you were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke recordsparagraph 38  he continues to ask well what happened after thatparagraph 40 this show pauls intent on finding out why mr leonard did not move onto bigger and better things
the background information that paul learned about mr leonard i think has made paul not be ashamed that he is getting help mr leonard told paul i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard this shows paul that he should get help with things now so that in the future he wont rely on other people like friends to get him by in college and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out
it shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up that he should always try his best and to try different things
paul is shocked to hear that mr leonard was in track an never told anyone
the background information helped paul see why its important to try in school it also got him motivated to want to go in track
it shows paul that school is important there are other people that can not read either like mr leonard
paul was surprised paul didnt know mr leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records
mr leonard is very much like paul he was once a young boy and possesses some of the same problems that paul seems to have      as a young child mr leonard had distractions and difficulties learning to this day as he is telling the story to paul he is still unable to read it is obvious that mr leonard wants to help paul and show him that he can pass school if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles i lost my scholarship and flunked out mr leonard stated paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that but it only made paul want to try harder to acheive his grades and go to college
when paul is in school and he has gym class he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports he wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesnt have to be picked last in everything
during the story the reader understands that paul has a hard time reading when he meets mr leonard paul becomes motivated by him by going out for track paul finds out that mr leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for mr leonard the last paragraph paul remembers what mr leonard did for him and wants to help mr leonard with his reading
the effect that the background information has on paul is that it encourages him to teach mr leonard how to read
the effect of the background of mr loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background
the backround information given to paul was used to help mr leonard with his reading
he was surprised when he found out that mr leonard was a high school track star
paul probably feels motivated because he isnt the only one who doesnt know how to read this motivates him to hurdle
paul is suprised that mr leonard didnt tell him about how he ran track in high school
paul had the same problem as mr leonard they both couldnt read but the difference paul had a reading program to go and mr leonard didnt so paul sees the similaritys between mr leonard and him with reading
when paul learns that mr leonard run track in college and boke some records he realizes how he know so much about track and understands why he is helping him once he is told about how he flunked out of collegepaul relize that he can help mr leonard to so he returns the favor and helps him with what he struggled with in school
the background information about mr leonard effects paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college paul is overwhelmed because mr leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals
paul understood where mr leonard was coming from  he  also realized they were similar  mr leonard helped paul train for hurtles and paul decided he could give something in return by teaching mr leonard to read
during the story paul is given a website to look at while looking at the website her found out a little history on mr leonards succes in track and field      in the hall paul was stopped by him he was confused when he found out that he did not know pauls name
mr leonard has background infromation he doesnt want to tell paul because his college sport he played he was disappointed on
i think that paul noticed how great of person he was he already had respect for mr leonard and did as he was told but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities it made paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well
when paul gets background information about mr leonard he is extremely surprised paul doesnt understand why mr leonard hasnt already informed him of his past accomplishments after all that mr leonard recounted to him paul could completely relate to mr leonard paul felt like they had a win win friendship because mr leonard had something to offer him and he had something to offer mr leonard
the effect it had on paul was somewhat like the effect paul had on mr leonard sympathy they knew how each other felt not knowing how to read the emotions in mr leonards words were all to familiar to me i knew them wellfeeling of embarassment when i ws called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him paul helped mr leonard just like he had helped paul
the information effects paul because he finds out that mr leonard is just like him he cant read when the coach gave paul that url and website to search him and he read about mr leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read just like mr leonard is helping him
paul finally understands why mr leonard is interested in him paul and mr leonard are alike in a way they both have problems reading and are good at track even though mr leonard is a college flunk out paul still feels the same about him if not better
the effect it has on paul is that he finds out that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school and he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through
he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best
mr leonard has kind of the same problems as paul mr lenoard was a good athlete but did poorly in school he relied on friends to help him get by mr leonard had problems with reading and fluked out of college because of it
cmonmrleonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training this statement made by paul shows that the background information that was given touched paul emotionally after hearing mr leonards story paul made a mental connection with him they both couldnt read they had something in common this new connection lead to paul being willing to help mr leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another
he underwstands why mr leonard worked with him to do this mr leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read bc they didnt have help centers
paul was a good athlete but not a good student he had no learning centes in school o relied on friends to help get him by even thou he worked hard and went to college
it effects the story in ways that mr leonard was a phenomenom he broke many records and the narator was being trained by a star athlete
paul feels horrible about what happened to mrleonard paul then feels remorse over the fact mrleonard cant readand then he relates their problems
that paul didnt really know about sports that well so he didnt know about mr leonard at all which made mr leonard not tell hima bout his past when he was in college
it encourages him to do his best therefor he goes to the track meets and is going to compete
the information paul learns on mr leonard makes him wonder and probably think of him as a role model paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes paul feel like he can help him just like mr leonard helped him with hurtles
paul reminded mr leonard about his college days paul is one of leonards best hurdlers
after the realization of mr leonards past paul wanted to help him paul saw that mr leonard was sad and a little regretful about flunking out of college so he wanted to teach him mr leonard had assisted paul and now paul wanted to assist mr leonard by tutorong him in readingcomprehension
paul and mr loenard both have the same thing in commom they both do not know how to read  both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class but after a while of talking to mr leonard paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete mr leonard teaches paul the lesson of nothing is impossible without determination
the background information that paul learns about mr leonard makes mr leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed for example the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew
in the beginning of the story paul tells the reader that he cannot read when mr leonard tells paul to stay after one day and showed him the basketball team paul tells the reader that he is always the last guy choosen in gym class and doesnt want more of that treatment then when mr leonard tells paul to run paul doesnt disobey because he is just use to doing as he is told throughtout the story with mr leonards help paul becomes great at track upon finding out that mr leonard cannot read paul decides that is it time to gave back to the man who made him a fast runner
the effect it has on paul is that mr leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help unlike mr leonard
from the way that paul responded from the information about mr leonard he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that mr leonard didnt tell him once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell paul i think paul understood more i think now paul has more of a connection with mr leonard because they have something in common neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles towards the end of the story it makes them closer
the effect paul gets from reading about mr leonards background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him after paul knew why he flunked out of college he took mr leonard too the learning center
the effect it has on paul is that paul can relate to it he knows what it feels like to be embarrassed about not being able to read
mr leonard was in the same situation that paul was in he is unable to read but is a good at running track it effects paul by making him want to help mr leonard to read which is at the end of the story
when paul finds out about mr leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldnt read he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him mr leonard had helped paul become good at track and in return paul said he would help him learn to read
it gives paul more knowledge on mr leonard it also makes him more confident in letting mr leonard coach him
the background information about mr leonard motivates paul to help him with something when he questions him and finds out the truth he says cmon mr leonard its time to start your training
all the background information on paul is the same as mr leonard paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with mr leonard mr leonard asked paul where do you think youre going paul said learning center mr leonard asked why paul said why i cant read later on in the story paul pulled out a piece of paper and said why didnt you tell me about this mr leonard said i looked good back then didnt i paul said you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records mr leonard said i remember best race of my life paul said well what happened after that mr leonard said i was a good athlete but not a good student we had no learning center in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always to hard paul said but you went to college mr leonard said things were different back then the college scouts told me that my grades didnt matter that id have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read see both paul and mr leonard cant read they are almost alike
the information about mr leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible just like mr leonard
paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about mr  leonard paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the schools learning center and disovers that mr leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities this motivated paul to help mr leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader
after paul listend to mr leonards story about his college experience it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do paul wants to pay mr leonard back not with money but with knowledge at the end of the story paul tells mr leonard that its time to start your trainging meaning its time to learn to read
it makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read
the effect that the background information has on paul is that
because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going the coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for paul also paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training
the effect the information had on paul about mr leonard was that paul was not the most intelligent kid and neither was mr leonard back in his day paul realized even though you do poor in something doesnt mean you cant still susceed mr leonard wanted to have paul realize that hes not the only one in the situation hes in
the background check on paul would be about the same as mr leonard becasue he was very good at track and field but he couldnt read he wanted to help paul get better at track and field and much better at reading he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field
the effect the background information on mr leonard  had on paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in mr leonard couldnt read but he was a really good athlete he had lost his scholarship though because he couldnt read     paul wanted to help mr leonard like he helped paul because he felt grateful toward him so paul started helping mr leonard learn to read
paul is kind of affended that mr leonard never told him because he says why didnt you tell me about this after he found out the whole truth behind the story he had sympathy for mr leonard because paul is in the same struggle and can relate he feels for leonard because he lost his future all because he couldnt do something as simple as read but it also made him realize that he is in a struggle against reading and school too and if he doesnt over come his obstacle his future at hurdles could end like mr leonards or simply never start
when paul gets the url from the coach to check out mr leonards background he could not believe it this guy was just like paul he won many awards for track but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read after paul figured out that mr leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name he knew he was going through the same thing paul thought that since mr leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track that paul would help him out by getting back into college atleast try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do paul was just helping mr leonard like he helped paul
when paul discovers that mr leonard cant read he understands mr leonards feelings about flunking out of college paul also knows why he was asked what his name was even tho mr leonard sees his pass every day it also explains why mr leonard did get suspicious about paul leaving class early since mr leonard helped paul so much he wanted to return the favor and invited mr leonard to his study group
paul learns that mr leonard never learned hwo to read and paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school he connects with mr leonard as mentioned in paragraph 45 the emotions in mr leonards words were all to familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud and understands who mr leonard feels     after learned about mr leonards history paul looks back on the days that mr leonard helped him with hurdles and decides to help mr leonard learn to read
the effect that the background information has on paul is that he is suprised at mr leonards achievements in college and how he is just a hall moniter in school after achieving greatness
he wants to do better at reading things and mrleonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did when he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did
at frist paul is pround for mr leonard because he broke records in collage but then when he finds out mr leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading paul felt sympathic and realized since mrleonard helped him that he could help read better
it makes paul feel better about himself he feels that way because he realizes that maybe he could actually excel at something that he could actually be good at something and not feel like he is left out paul had no idea that mr leonard was in a way like him i think paul gained some confidence discovering mr leonards past
asked him questions every day he stop him in the hall to see his hall pass
paul never knew that mr leonard was in track he learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records mr leonard then told paul that he flunked out of college because he couldnt read also paul then felt closer to mr leonard and a little bad for him because they didnt have help at his school so paul decided to help him read
after reading and finding out all he did about mr leonard paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out he had finally found someone who in all reality was just like him as paul talks to mr leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed paul decided the best thing to do was to help mr leonard out by helping him learn to read
paul shows an interest to him and try to help paul understand the situation of mr leonard therefore paul interested in help him our
mr leonard was once in the same situation as paul was in it makes paul think how far he has gotten and how much help he recieved
the back ground information on mr leonard reflects on paul becausemr leonard was in the same situation as paul paul realizes that mr leonard is empathetic and it motivates him to do good  paul feels the same ways at mr leonard an wants to retrn the favore
when paul learns about mr leonards past he doesnt get discouraged instead it motivates him to help mr leonard paul wants to help mr leonard like mr leonard helped him in paragragp fortyfive paul states that he understands the emotions that mr leonard felt and that is why he decides to start training him in reading at the end of the story
paul is a student that needed help at reading but also he needed a tutor for help to become very good reader and talented at what ever he do
paul is surprised that mr leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in high school paul asks mr leonard about why he never told him once he finds out why he feels a stronger connection between the two he feels as if he has found a way to give back to mr leonard also we know this because at the end of the story the narrorator says cmon mr leonard its time to start your training
paul discovers the truth about mr leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation when mr leonard first tells paul about what he used to be paul was filled with unbelief until he explained his situation of not being able to read and dropping out of school paul knew those feelings and it motivates him to try harder to be the best he can while training so that he may make mr leonhard proud
he told him to meet him at 230pm then with all the trainning he eneded up telling him that he was in high school and ran track and ended up going to collage and droped out cause the school didnt want some kid that couldnt read
mr leonards past had a big effect on paul it incoureges paul to do well in reading and even stars have the same problem he does it helps him not to hold back because if mr leonard can do it he can to just with a differant outcome
i believe that the background information paul learns shows him that even if you arent as good in school as others you can still be the best you can be also i think he learned that friendship was the key way to success and since mr leonard helped him with his hurdles that he must help him read so they can both overcome lifes challenges
the information on mr leonards past had astonished paul however it also helped motivate him to do better he realized the importance of doing something well and the feeling you get when you do it well he also felt a similarity with mr leonard which helped him make the bond stronger
paul is a lot like mr leonard  they both couldnt read but they were really good at hurdles mr leonard got helped with grades but it didnt work it was still to hard for him the only thing he was good at was track mr leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school      paul is the same way when mr leonard found out he paul couldnt read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read mr leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life
it reminded paul of himself paul said i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when paul knew the reason why mrleonard tried to help him and encourage him to do well
the background information makes paul wonder why mr leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college he feels that he can relate to mr leonard because he cant read all that well but he is good at track
he finds out that mr lenoard was a track star and that he held a bunch of records theses are good thigs for paul because he has a coach that knows what he is doing
as paul learns about mr leonards past he begins to grow a stronger bond with him sseing as he felt his pain
the background information about mr leonard has a staggering effect on paul  paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime  his first actions are to inquire about his coachs former accomplishments
i think that paul really relates to mr leonards background information because he couldnt read back when he was a kid and neither can paul that is why mr leonard took paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something just like mr leonard
i think that the information that paul learns about mr leonard makes him respect him more because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach i also think that paul felt alot more comfortable with mr leonard when he found out that he couldnt read because he felt like he could relate to mr lenord more
he feels privledged to have such a great successful athlete to be training him how to do the hurdles he wonders why mr leonard didnt tell him why he was so succesful from the beginning when he first started training himi pulled out the printout id downloaded the night before from my pocket why didnt you tell me about this paragraph 35
the revelation that mr leonard also struggled with schoolwork provided a way to establish a deeper connection to paul  when the narrarator states the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me  i knew them well he is revealing how he can empathize with mr leonard
the background infromation the paul learns about mr leonard effects him by showing him that hes not the only one with reading problems and the mr leonard was just like him as a kid it also makes him want to learn more and help mr leonard learn how to read too
paul feels embrrassment when mr leonard tells him about his schoolingi knew them wellfeeling of embarrassmenthe was embarrassed because he did some of the things mr leonard told him he did
paul can relate to mr leonard about al the trouble he had back in high school because he is goiung through all of that know  paul wants to be as good of a runner as mr leonard
in the story gifts paul has trouble reading  twice a week he visits mr leonard the hall monitor  after awhile mr leonard asks paul to come out to the track with him and paul does  as paul starts training he gets better and better till he ends up talking to the high school track coach  with futher inspection and guidance from the coach paul finds out mr leonard was a national champion for the 400 hurdles  come to find out the story is the same both have trouble reading  mr leonard was not able to get help and lost his scholarship  he wants paul to acheive a better life
it changes his mind about sports
he understands how mr leonard feels about it because he has the same problem and it brings paul closer to mr leonard because he now understands him more
the effect that his background information has on paul is he feels like he can relate to not reading and he likes track
the background information paul finds on mr leonard has a huge effect on paul because he has a lot in common with mr leonard mr leonard was great at hurdles and so is paul mr leonard also does not know how to read and that is what paul has troubles with and is trying to fix the information on mr leonard makes paul want to strive more for what he could have
the effect that background information has on paul is that paul cant read and when mr leonard was younger he flunked out of college and didnt want paul to flunk so he pushed him
the background infromation on mr leonard effects paul because it helps paul realize that he and leonard have the same problem they both dont want to be embarrassed by the mistakes they make paul with problem at reading and leonard with his drop out history but this also helps paul by giving him the courage to get past his problem thats how the background information effects paul
paul learns that mr leonard was an amazing athlete when he was younger  he is a bit disappointed that mr leonard never told him about his college track success  in the last paragraph it shows that paul and mr leonard end up switching roles because of the information
when paul knows about mr leonards
i think that it helps him alot because he now knows that the coach was ding what he knew trying to help the kid on something that he could not accomplish himself
in the story the reader is told of mr leonards achievements in track and his failures as a student it is said that although he was able to win and set records nationally he wasnt able to pursue this track career because he couldnt maintain his grades through learning this paul is able to empathize he can relate to mr leonards struggles and take that to know that he was not just the child with a learning disability but also the child with potential in his seeminglydissapointing life
paul has sympathy for mr leonard because paul knows how he is feeling paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer he gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does paul then relizes that mr leonard helped him with hurdles and paul can help mr leonard with reading
he gets information about him when he dont need it so he takes offense to it
this effect paul by making him inspired that the coach would take time out for him and lend him some advice
that mr leonard was a great athlete and he knew that he could achieve and also be a great athlete if he kept practicing and kept training
it makes paul finally realize why mr leonard is helping him  they relate in a way that paul could never imagine and mr leonard is only trying to help
paul feels that he understands mr leonard better because he knows what it is like to not be able to read  this makes him want to work harder and then teach mr leonard to read
when paul learns that mr leonard was a track star he wonders why he isnt anymore when mr leonard tells him that he flunked out of his scholarship paul is very empathetic to him because he knows how mr leonard feels when paul finds out about all of this he wants to help mr leonard
 i dont know
the effect it has on paul is it shows him that if he works hard anything is possible
by learning about mr leonardss past paul feels motivated to overcome the dificulties that are ahead of him paul feels that he should work harder on everything in his life after discovering mr leonards career in college track
paul finds out that that mr leonard was a track star when he was in high school and got a scholar sship for college but he couldnt read so they had to take him out
when paul learns of mr leonards past he becomes sympathetic towards mr leonards reading difficulties which paul also has this sympathy is expressed when paul tells mr leonard that its time to start his training this meaning that paul is trying to help mr leonard overcome his problems
the background information that the reader recieves about mr leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read  also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him  knowing this information it had a great effect on paul  now that paul knew this he was more determined to excel in school and do well and also find something he likes and excel in that like the hurdles and track
the information he found effected him in a good way it made him feel better about the fact that he couldnt read he found out that he wasnt the only one out there that couldnt read and it gave him more reasons to keep going to the learning center to get better at reading it was the extra push to keep him going
after learning about mr leonards past paul seems to be able to identify more with him he seems to feel closer to mr leonard and wants to help him too he also realizes why mr leonard did what he did to help paul
paul like the information because it information that he would not have had on his trainer if he had not asked
in gifts paul learns background information about mr leonard  paul learns that mr leonard was an award winning track star at his college but flunked out and lost his scholarship when he had a difficult time reading  paul responds by feeling more of a connection to mr leonard  paul then feels motivated to train mr leonard in reading
back when he was in collage he was a track star he wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work even then the school work was to hard for him he lost his scholarship and flunked out of school
mr lenonard was a great athlete in track and field in school he had trouble in reading but he got help from a learning place then he went to college and aslo got help
the background information makes paul puzzled  paul did not understand why mr leonard kept his college tack experience a secret  when mr leonard told paul that he flunked out of college paul understood why he kept it a secret
the background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects paul by giving him motivation  since mr leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach paul how to be a successful runner as well  throughout the story this confidence in paul helps motivate him to train and listen to mr leonard
after mr lenonard told his story to paul paul realized that acdemic learning is more important than sports he has to participate in his school work because no matter how good mr lenorad was his college still lost his scholarship and flunkes out it is important to learn in schools
the effect of mr leonard background information doesnt bother paul that much when paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a track and field star he makes connections in paragraph 35 paul is alittle upset that mr leonard didnt tell him about his amazing college career but in paragraph 45 when paul realizes that him and mr leonard are very much alike he is happy and wants to give back to mr leonard
when paul finds out that mr leonard was illeterate he understands that he should help him read just as mr leonard was helping him in track this is implied in paragraph 46 when the narrator tells mr leonard it is time for his training which means the narrator will help mr leonard to learn how to read
the background information of mr leonard inspires paul the information inspires paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and mr leonard mr leonard although not able to read was successful at other things including track by paul learning of mr leonards past he feels more accepted and normal
the background information on mr leonard had an effect on paul because he seemed anxious to know why mr leonard didnt hurdle anymore and what had happened
mr leonard and paul are two characters that are quite similar in the story it says that both characters had a very hard time reading and they are both athletic so mr leonards effect on paul is motivational he wants paul to not repeat mr leonards past and instead push on and be the best he can be
the effect that background information of mr leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him he knew them well the feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class he knows that even if he cant read like everyone else he can still be good at something mr leonard gave his time to help paul excel so paul decided to see mr leonard excel at something to
once paul finds out about mr leonard past he is in shock      not knowing that the hall monitor mr leonard was a star in college who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records
paul is suspicious on why mrleonard didnt tell him about his past he questions him on why he didnt tell him about his track records in college then mr leonard tells him he flunked out because he couldnt read paul gets influeced by this to teach mr leonard to read because mr leonard influenced him to run hurdles
background has an effect on paul including encouragement and confidence  paul tells of how he met mr leonard and how he became close to him  later paul tells about on the track and because paul already knows mr leonard he has confidence in his abilities already  after the first time around the track paul feels discouraged but mr leonard already being his friend helps to encourage paul
the information probaby has a big effect on paul because paul cant read either paul may feel he can look up to mr leonard and that he is his romodel
paul is empathetic to mr leonards troubles like paul mr leonard was poor in school paul feels closer to him saying that he knew mr leonards feelings and words were all too familiar he realizes then that mr leonard helped him excel in something and offers to help mr leonard excel in something too
he felt like they had something incommon i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew
the effect that the background check of mr leonard has on paul is a good one it opens pauls eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second if you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport mr leonard wants to live his dreams through of paul because he wants paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing this was a huge lesson in pauls life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals
it gave him more confidence knowing that mr leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day
paul doesnt seemed surprised that mr leonard was a star athlete in track hes more interested in why mr lenoard never told him about it before paul asks mr leonard why he had never said anything before and leonard smiles sadly while he remembers the past it turns out mr leonard wasnt a good reader either and flunked out of college paul has the same feelings and relates to mr lenoard  paul then supports him by telling mr leonard its time to start your training
the reader gets background on mr leonard from a track website that the coach gave him to look up paul didn understand why he quiet but he also didn know that leonard didn no how to read leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes but college was alot harder and leonard could not keep up with the school work  so he flunked out so paul decided to help leonard to learn how to read like loenard helped paul to overcome an obstical
he fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read thats what paul is dong right now is learning how to read and run the hurdles and paul can help his teacher learn how to read
when paul first discovers mr leonards seemingly glorious past he is puzzled at the notion that mr leonard would keep that information from him paul then must decide to confront mr leonard upon doing so he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only mr leonard but himself too paul finds out that mr leonard also struggled with literature and reading in fact mr leonards inferiority regarding the subject helps paul to identify with him for he too is plagued with the same problem     because paul discovers this he feels a drive he feels a reason he actually begins to feel adequate now with the understanding that he can achieve he feels reason to pay back the favor he decides to help mr leonard learn to read well without knowing that mr leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics paul would have never had made such a life changing change  realizing his value
he wants to help the kid because he is a good boy and
paul is mad that someone checks his hall pass twice a week and he really dont like that becuase they think he is going some where else then where he says he is going so that is way they check his hall pass twice a week
i personally think mr leonard giving paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated paul and made him want to help mr leonard the fact that mr leonards dream was shattered because couldnt read made paul want to work hard so that he wouldnt have to fall in the same pattern as mr leonard did when he was younger he probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading paul felt that mr leonards words were all too familiar because paul was having trouble reading as well
i guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
paul realizes that mr leonard is trying to help him become great at hurdles mr leonard knows that paul had trouble reading but he worked to fix the problem by being in the remedial reading program mr leonard was fantastic at hurdles in college but he couldnt read so no colleges wanted him to go there he wanted paul to be able to be mentally and physically well
it made people think of him different
paul was shocked but was feeling not alone paul said that mr leonard had givin his time to help him with track and to help him excel at  somthing it made paul realise what he could do for mr leonard
they become good friends and because of mr leonard he gets very good at hurdles he finds out that mr leonard cant read and because of the learning center paul helps mr leonard how to read
what
paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because mr leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read and thats what makes him realize
by finding information about mr leonard on the internet it gave paul the motivation to help mr leonard just like mr leonard had helped paul
when paul finds out about mr leonard he wonders why he didnt tell him he approaches mr leonard about it and finds out that he flunked out of college because he couldnt read paul decides he wants to help mr leonard just as mr leonard helped him
he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life
paul find out that mr leonard was a good track runner but not so good at reading it effected paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder
it has a big effect on paul because mr leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger in the story he shows mr leonard what he found out about him and mr leonard felt sad because he didnt want paul to find out he couldnt read either
in this story when paul gets the background information on mr leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him paul starts thinking about why he didnt run anymore paul confronted mr leonard about it and discovered mr leonard was in the same shoes as paul was paul then realizes why mr leonard was trying to help him
he had an effect on paul because he tryed so hard to be a good student
it helps him feel better knowing that he wasnt the only one with the same kind of reading problem
in highschool lenard was like paul not good at school work but a good athletic guy
he is overwhelmed with who he is talking to and that mr leonard has the same problem he does by not bring able to read when paul said  but you wnet to college
the result of the background information is that paul finds out that mr leonard was a college freshman who broke records for the 400 meter hurdles the impact on paul is tramendous because he relizes he has a collage all star working with him
doesnt make sense
they both have the same problem not being able to read and do good in school
paul is surprised to find out that mr leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he was a collage freshman then he found out that he had flunked out of college because he couldnt read so paul decided to help mr leonard
in paragraph 5 lines 13 when paul finds that mr leonard couldnt read he knows the feeling the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called pon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answere everyone else knew then paul realized he can help mr leonard cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training
the effect that the background information on mr lenard has on the reader is inspiring to him paul finds out that mr lenonard had the same struggles with reading and school work that he has but he still was an exellent runner making paul want to keep at it so that he could be the same way it was also inspiring because the teacher told him that he flunked out of college because he did not get good grades that would make paul want to work harder at his school work so that the same thing would not happen to him
paul and mr leonard are talkin one day after practice and paul finds out that mr leonard went to a learning center when he was  in high school mr leonard also was an amazing athlete he did track and field and was very good at it
that he knows that mr leonard is just like him
i think that at first paul wonders why mr leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler  i think paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this  once paul finds out that mr leonard has a hard time reading too paul begins to fell really empathetic towards mr leonard
the effect the background information about mr leonard had on paul was inspiring it was inspiring because both mr leonard and paul had gonewere going through the same thing mr leonard couldnt read but was excellent at sports and paul couldnt read but mr leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldnt be a total loser mr leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help paul feel good about himself
mrs leonard didnt want him to go to the reading center
that the kid didnt know about mr leonardthat he ued to run track back in his days as a college student
the effect that background information had on paul was that it made paul think that mr leonard was a quitter  being so good and maybe the best at something paul wondered why on earth would someone quit if they were that good  if paul would not have talked to mr leonard about this he maybe would have quit also
it tells paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys
pauls opinion of mr leonard changes for the better paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself when he finds out about mr leonards past and what happened to him paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying cmon mr leonardits time to start your training
paul was shocked that mrleonard didnt tell him about his past and when mrleonard did he listened to see what he had to say when paul heard mr leonard speak and tell his story he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed an then he thought about what mr leonard was trying to do for himso he thought about what he could do for mr leonard
when paul found this information he was shocked that he was hiding something so big like that from him paul was confused that a college level athleate was not good in school
the backround information about mr leonard has a big effect on paul because paul understands why mr leonard would want to coach him it also makes paul want to work harder for his coach because they have had alot of the same struggles i also think mr leonard would make paul better than he was so paul didnt have some of the same problems he did
paul finds out mr leonard was actually a very good athlete he went to nationals for track and field and broke records he also found out mr leonard was not very smart and that he flunked out of college this made paul want to help mr leonard to get back up and get into track and field again paul wants to train him now
paul had not known about mr leonard so he did as asked paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast he then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up mr leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast then he learns about a lot about mrleonard  which i think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend mr leonard
paul met mr leonard when i started middle school he was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving along from one classroom to the next
mr leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldnt continue to be a racer this made paul realize why mr leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read
that infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down he looks up to mr grabowski and now sees a fall between the two
the backround information has a tremendous effect on paul  i say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete  he also realized that mr leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills  paul realizes the signicance of mr leonards help
the background infromation that paul the narrator gets in this story is mr leonard was an allstar track runner in high school  he broke records and got scholarships  paul also learned that mr leonard had a hard time comprihending  reading like himself  mr leonard flunked college because he could not read well     paul knew what it was like for  mrleonard becaue paul could not read well nor could he comprihend things easily
the reader and paul share the same mind frame it states in the article no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read they are both very dedicated to their athletics however when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future in the article it states i know them welli didnt know the answer everyone else knew when it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker
the background information that paul gathers about mr leonard is that he use to be a college track star  he found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that mr leonard broke records  mr leonard then tells him i was a good athletebut not a good student  we had no learning centers in our school  i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard  it turns out that just like paul mr leonard is a talented athlete but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read  luckily paul does have those resources and talent so hopefully he can make it farther than mr leonard
mr leonard found out paul failed out of college because he could not read when mr leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center by doing a backgroung check he is helping paul out
it makes paul kinda in a way want to help mr leonard but i also think that its gonna motivate paul because he knows that mr leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport mr leonard tells paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read he also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read so all in all i think that paul is doing this for mr leonard
that he was happy to find out what happend to himand what happend after school then he was sad to find out that he had droped out of college because that he could not read after that he found out that it is a ok promble that you cant read  to it is better to try and do not give up at all
he gets asked about it in the hallway
mr leonard shares with paul that he was a hurderler back in the day he was a great athlete and even broke records but then mr leonard tells paul about his misfortune mr leonard couldnt read paul struggles greatly with reading so they both resemble eachother in that aspect however paul is in a learning center to get better at it mr leonard never had that opportunity
paragraph 33 sentence 1 he knows what he is doing
paul realizes that it does not matter wheather you are the best athlete in the world colleges are looking for an athlete with good educational skills as well
the effect it had on paul was that he was just like him when he was younger so when paul saw what he has accomplished then he feels that he can do this
when paul hears about how mr leonard had a hard time in high school and collage the narrator learns that mr leonard didnt have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days  paul felt much sympathy for mr leonard and decided to help him read
the author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story the foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well       the author begins by introducing mr leonard as the hall monitor this suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor when mr leonard ask paul what his name is in paragraph 24 it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass another incident like this occurs when paul shows mr leonard his printout and mr leonard responds with a confused look      the authors uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know mr leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character paul
the background information helps paul realize why mr leonard wanted to help him and it allows paul to help mr leonard in return
things were different back then mr leonard was told that grades didnt matter that he would have all the help he needed but that was all a lie he ended up losing his scholarship and flunking out of college no college wanted someone who couldnt read       mrleonards were words that were familiar to paul he was embarrassed when he was called on or when he didnt know the answer because he couldnt read all those feelings that mrleonard had paul had the exact       mrleonard gave his time to help paul succeed at something after paul realized what meleonard was doing for him he wanted to help mrleonard out paul had then started training with mrleonard
it has a lot of effect on him because mr leonard is trying to help paul over come obsticales and knowing that mr leonard was a national finalist made paul wonder why he is helping him then he basicla said that he doesnt want paul to end up like him and not be able to read so that probably encouraged aul to try harder in school and learn to read
when paul first discovers the shocking new information on mr leonard he is a bit confused when mr leonard explains fully however paul quickly goes from confused to understanding the way paul can relate to mr leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes paul a little emotional then inspired by how mr leonard helped him despite the troubles he had had himself paul decides he wants to return the favor and help out mr leonard
he is interested in it mrleonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races paul is lucky to have a coach like mrleonard
paul and mr leonard are like the same person in this story only mr leonard has been through the things paul is going through now and mr leonard wants to help paul overcome his problems since he knows what hes going through
it shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasnt able to he cant read and paul struggles reading
it helps paul know that he isnt the only one with this problem  he realized that mr leonard had felt the same thing that he paul was feeling  and like how mr leonard had helped him paul decides to help mr leonard
paul wants to help mr leonard he feels the same way as mr leonard did back when he was in high school hes going to train him on how to read and mr leonard is goin to trian paul how to do hurdles
it has an effect on paul because he completely understands what mr leonard has gone through in a way he went through the same thing and it states in the story that mr leonards words were all too familiar after learning mr leonards story paul now has someone that he can connect with it also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing
from the background of mr leonard paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either paul feels that if he can do what mr leonard taught him he can be just like him also at the end of the story where paul finds out that mr leonard could not read paul wants to teach him to read just like mr leonard taught him to run hurdles
the background information on mr leonard that paul gets is only a way to motivate him more he realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing
the backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for mr leonard makes the narrator respect mr leonard more he knows mr leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about therefore he respects and follows his advice
when paul gets the background information about mr leonard it effects paul because just like leonard he cant read but they both are good at hurdles only bad thing is that leonard coldnt get through college because he couldnt read so that could have a huge effect on paul because he doesnt know how to read
when paul prints out that paper on mr leonard he learns that he was the best hurdler in the nation paul also learns that mr leonard couldnt read just like paul couldnt  then mr leonard tells paul how he flunked out of college paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle
when paul gets background information on mr leonard he feels that he can relate to mr leonard since both of them couldnt read in school and wre both great runners it also determines paul to do better in school and track
the information that paul learns about mr leonared makes paul want to be better in the sport that he wants to be in and try out
paul figures out that mr leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well  paul didnt understand how he got to college paul decided to help mr leonard learn how to read  cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training
mr leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground his brow furrowed his voice cracked as he spoke
it shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well people are good at different things and noone can do everything it kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do
mr leonard eventually tells paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was pauls age however he was a good runner his athletic ability got him into college but later as a result of his lack of academic ability he was kicked out paul could very much relate to mr leonards words when mr leonard told him all of this paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically considering mr leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles
but you went to college paul seems as if hes supprised
it changes paul whole outllook on mr leonard and he feels sorry for him in fact he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage
it helps paul find out who mr leonard is it also helps him understand how similar each of them are to each other
he probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school when he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that mr leonard was in
paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time mr leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place     when mr leonard asked paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework  once paul got to the gym he was asked by mr leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles  when he was finished he said that was aweful but mr leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts     i began to wonder why mr leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look mr leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help       paul began to realize that mr leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically since paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles
i think the background information of mr leonard inspired paul after paul found out that mr leonard was a star track runner he was shocked that mr leonard had not already told him paul decided that he wanted to help mr leonard to learn how to read because afterall mr leonard was helping him become a track runner this helps paul relate to mr leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners
the effect that the background information has on paul makes him see mr leonard as an inspiration the information allows paul to personally see himself in mr leonard and he compares himself to him for instance when he reads the information from the website about mr leonard he is astonished by his accomplishments once mr leonard tells paul about his past paul is inspired by his words once the information has sunk in to pauls mind he uses mr leonards story to motivate himselft to be better than mr leonard has turned out to be
he is familiar with the things that mr leonard had went through neither of them can read very well paul feels compelled to help mr leonard with his reading skills since he helped paul improve his running ability
i  think paul knowing about mr leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as mr leonard
he was intrigued by the efforts of mr leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out because mr leonard flunked he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed  in the last sentence paul says cmon mr lenoard its time to start your training he wants to help him to excel at something as mr leonard had for him
the effect that the background information that paul finds on mrleonard is shocking to paul he wanted to why mrleonard wouldnt tell him about about mrleonard being the star athelet when he was in high school when paul meets up with mrleonard he asks him  why didnt you tell me about this mrleonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldnt do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him
paul does not know what mr leonard did before he worked at the school paul is amazed when he learns that mr leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman mr leonard then says he wasnt a good student and his running career was ended because of it paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay mr leonard for his time by teaching him how to read
the high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that leonard grabowski was the person that was helping paul with track he also gives paul a piece of paper with a website url and tells him to do a search for grabowski this search pulls up information about leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college paul asked leonard what had happened after leonard had the best race of his life leonard told paul that he was a good athelete but he didnt know how to read so he was a horrible student this was touching to paul because now he had someone else to relate to since leonard didnt know how to read either the information that paul got will push him harder to learn how to read
the effect that the background information about mr leonard has on paul is to try harder when paul showed mr leonard that he knew about his times in college mr leonard told paul how hard it was
paul feels just like mr leonard felt in high school and college
the information that paul gets helps him understand why mr leonard was sympathetic for him mr leonard like paul had trouble reading he also had potentinal to be a star track athlete however mr leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it at the end of the story its implied that paul was going to help mr leonard with his reading just like mr leonard helped paul with his track prowess
it surprises him because mr leonard never told him about how he was a college track star it also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star
paul understands now that the reason mr leonard wants to help paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in high school and realizes that they are a lot a like
paul finds out that mr leonard was a big track star and that he could not read so paul believes that mr leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school
after paul finds out that mr leonard cant read paul decides to help mrleonard the same way that mr leonard helped him
paul wants to be like mr lenard now so he askes mrlenard about his college track days
paul was influenced by mr leonard trying to help him and it was more helpful to paul to see that mr leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that paul himselkf struggles with  it  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing  an example would be mr leonard doesnt help paul learn to read but he starts to train him in hurdles helping him learn how to over come obsticals
when paul realizes that mr leonard had broken records in track and field and had gone to college he wondered why mr leonard had never shared said information with him when he asked mr leonard about it he discovered that much like himself mr leonard had trouble reading and learning in schoolafter discovering that he had many things in common academically with mr leonard paul decided that he would help mr leonard much like mr leonard had voluntarily helped him he began training mr leonard to read well
paul was going to help the teacher with things he needed help on  he did this by walkin towards the school telling mr leonard it was time for his training
paul didnt know why mr leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star when paul asked its because he had the same problem paul has
when paul discovered what mr leonard had accomplished in his life it gave him hope and courage to do the same he was dtermined to be a better athlete he wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him
some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information i was a good athlete he said softly  but not a good student we had ne learning centers in our school he relied on friends to help him get by
they are kinda alike in ways because mr leonard cannot read well and neither can paul
in the story paul seemed suprised that mr leonard had been a former track runner and that he was good at the hurtles
paul thinks the mr leonard is just a hall moniter and paul does not know that mr leonrad had anything to do with being a track star
the information that he finds out about mr leonard shocks paul when he finds out mr leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard makes paul upset paul feels sorry curious about it paul pointed to the picture and asked mr leonard about it
he was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he broke records he broke records and he was an eceptional athlete
mr leonards background information really makes paul want to join track bcause this whole time he was putting his self down and not realizing that it only takes a little talent to become a star mr leonard tells him that he didnt do to well in school and that was something that paul had incommon with mr leonard and when a teacher or coach can relate to a student or a team member that can bring out the best in a person and make them want to reach there goal faster which is what paul ends up doing in the story
paul was more interested in his life well what happened after that
paul thinks that mr leonard was a man that was mean a didnt really like kids
in the story it shows that he is a nice guy but he can be a little bit mean as well too the effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast but than he lost his scholarship for college due to his grades even though they told him that they could help him with his grades but he flunked out anyways
mr leonard and paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful
the effect that the background information has on paul is that the information makes him very surprised it motivates him to try harder though because he struggles with school just like mrleonard did he knew exactly how mrleonard felt because he had been through the exact same things paul saw himself in mrleonard and it motivated him to change himself along with mrleonard again
mr leonard reflects who he is now paul is watching himself in him that we should be better than he and make mr leonard happy by giving hima job to become his coach
paul finds out that mr leonard was a college athlete and realises he has a great coach this helps hm get a chance to work out with the highschool coach
paul starts to understand why mr leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading
the effect that the background information on mr leonard has on paul is that him and mr leonard are very similar because they both had troubles with knowing how to read both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read
after he goes on the website and finds the articles about mr leonard he wonders why he never told him so when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team and he told him he coulnt read so that influenced paul to teach mr leonard how to read
he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read
mr leonards background information inspires paul he finds out about mr leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college mr leonard flunked out of college because he couldnt read nobody really helped him paul decides hes going to work harder in school and at track
paul probably didnt have that much respect for mr leonard i mean he had some because he never cried and complained and mr leonard reached out to him because of mr leonard paul gained respect for himself and didnt look so down on himself as much      when paul learned that mr leonard was once a track star paul was shocked it seemed paul didnt know why mr leonard didnt tell everyone that he broke records paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves but its their job to find what they are best at
the information about mr leomard gets the narrator wondering why if mr leomard was such a good runner then why is he a school monitor it makes paul mysterious about mr leomard in a way also because mr leonard is too good of an athelete to be a hallway monitor
the information that paul obtained about mr leonard probably confused and suprised paul at the same time he was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner but confused because mr leonard never told him
the background information uncovered has a positive effect on the relationship between paul and mrleonard you can tell this by the last line where it is incinuated that after they practice track they will practice reading together
the effect the background information ahas in paul is that when mr leonard was telling paul all the things that was wrong it reminded paul of himself when mr leonard said that he couldnt read and that he wasnt smart enough to make it through college paul got a glimpse of his future paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help so that is why he told mr leonard his training is to begin
when paul gets information about mr leonard from his past he is shocked at first he is more sympathetic towards mr leonard so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained paul from the passage paul says to mr leonard walking towards school  its time to start your trainging
the backgroung information that paul learns about mr leonard makes paul feel better about himself paul can relate to mr leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading
mr leonard is a quiet man about himself and doesnt mention himself or his past much throughout the story the track coach gives paul a website to go look up about mr leonard paul finds out that mr leonard was a national 400 meter hurdle champion as a freshman in college paul wants to know why he didnt keep running throughout college but then he finds out that mr leonard did not know how to read that well himself and flunked out of college
paul did not know about mr leonard being a track star in high school so when the track coach gave paul the website to check out he asked mr leonard why he never told paul he was a track star paul is glad to have a real athlete to help him so now its his turn to help mr leonard
paul says the wnotions in mr leonards words wew all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment
the background information startled paul when he herd about mr leonard
it shows him that he can still acomplish things even if he has trouble reading he wants to help mr leaonard learn how to read that way he will not feel ashamed talking abou his college exsperience paul tells mr leonard its time to start your training
he starts to want to work out with the team after finding out it has a great impact on his decision to continue with runing
paul is confused and somewhat angry why didnt you tell me about this paul was astonished at the fact that mr leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment mr leonard replied with comments such as i was a good athlete but not a good student no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read paul felt as if he had some of mr leonards qualities in him and since mr leonard help him he should return the favor its time too start you training
mr leanard was a hall monator in middle school he was select few in a leraning program he also worked with a tutor he wroked with mr leonard with track
mr leonard was a poor reader and the effect that background information has on paul the emotions in mr leonard words were all to familiar they knew them well
i think the effect on paul is huge considering that somebody of that skill is taking their time to help him overcome obstacles in his life the story shows this when mr leonard asks what paul is doing after school and then taking time to bring him to the track and train with him
paul finds out that mr leonard could not read just like himself and also that mr leonard was a track star it made paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend
when paul learns that mr leonard used to be a recordbreaking track star his freshman year in college it opens up a whole new perspective of him he realizes why mr leonard has been helping him and decides that he too can help mr leonard overcome obstacles in his life
paul becomes fast at the 400m hurdles and mr leonard broke records as a freshman at nationals but they both cant read and mr leonard failed out of college beccause of it and it shocks paul greatly cause now he is put into an identical postion
the information effected paul because mr leonard is a great athlete mr leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades mr leonard inspired paul because they are very similar paul was bad at school also and paul is also a great athlete it gave paul so inspiration in life to succeed
paul is shocked when he finds out who mr leonard realy is  then when paul learns that mr leonard cant read either he has remorse for him  paul new his pain all to well and thats why he decided to help mr leonard learn to read
paul figures out more about mr leonards past and an explanation why he was coaching paul in track paul then wants to know about why mr leonard stopped doing track in college
they like to play sports and they dont know how to read
the effect that the background information has on paul was that he became motivated for something he had never done before he had felt like he had something in common with mr leonard mr leonard went through the same troubles as paul is now mr leonard said that he could not read either
paul wonders why mr leonard never told him about being a champion at hurdling he finds out that mr leonard didnt tell him because he was ashamed that he had flinked out of college because he couldnt read
the background information paul aquires allows paul to understand him more and where mr leonard is coming from it motivates paul to work hard at hurdles and to keep working hard for his grades
paul feels that mr leonard and him have so much in common paul has trouble reading and the reason mr leonard didnt know his name was because he was a poor reader as well after paul found out about mr leonard it made him feel comfortable knowing that he wasnt alone in his situation and someone just as great as mr leonard struggled as well
because pauls coach child life is simmilar to his as in a good runner but a bad reader
paul is very impressed by mr leonards track talents he feels very empathetic for mr leonard when he learns he cant read because paul has the same problem paul has even felt the same feelings of embarrassment when asked to read aloud for this reason he feels for mr leonard
when paul found out that mr leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery when paul saw mr leonard the next day paul asked him about the printout that paul had printed out the night before then mr leonard explain the first parts of his track career the paul asked him what else happened and mr leonard explain that he copied off his friends in highschool and didnt do hardly any of the work but once he got the collage he didnt know what to do so therefore he lost his scholarship and flunked out of collage
paul is shocked by the information about mr leonard in paragraph 45 paul explains that mr leonards emotions are similar to his own
in the story paul finds out that mr leonard was just like him in school couldnt read paul was all too familiar with the words mr leonard had said mr leonard had flunked out of school and lost his scholarship paul is willing to help mr leonard learn how to read and mrleonard is willing to help paul get a scholarship
at first pault just thinking mr leonard is a hall monitor gets him motivated to try doing hurdles as the story progresses and  the learns that he has trouble ready just as paul does he feals closer to him and even more motivated the more things he learns about him the more motivated he becomes nearing the end of the story when paul learns that mr leonard was actually a collage choach he became even more motivated pretty much everything mr leonard did helped motivate paul
paul feels empathetic towards mr leonards predicament as he knows what it is like to feel embarrassed over reading paul comes to understand why mr leonard wants paul to keep trying and to keep working hard and paul greatfully accepts
the effect this had on paul was good he wanted to start to help mr leonard paul said that is was time for mr leonards training this was a good thing because mr leonards life is a lot like pauls so he feels he can be the same he knows he should learn to read then he can excel in the hurdles like mr leonard this had great impact on paul
paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like mr leonardhe really felt for him 
near the end of the story paul visits the website mr leonard tells him to go to and paul is amazed mr leonard was a track star in college mr leonard tells paul that he flunked out of college and lost his colleg scholarship because he couldnt read and paul was empathetic and in return decides to teach mr leonard how read since he helped paul in excelling at hurdling
from what i read the backround check helped paul feel better for himself when mr leonard told him he flunked out of college because they didnt have a learning center so he relied on his friends to help him pass when paul learned that he felt bad for mr leonard paul decided to start training with mr leonard to make him feel good about himself and show him that he did learn something
paul was impressed by mr leonards record as a college track star which is evident by pauls interest and impressed tone when he confronted mr leonard  when mr leonard informed paul of his reading disability paul sympathized with mr leonards emotions of embarrassment  the challenge and talent that mr leonard had in common with paul inspired paul to return mr leonards generosity with his time so paul will likely teach mr leonard to read
paul learned about mr leonard from the high school track coach in the story he learned of the site on the internet and look it up giving fim the information that mr leonard was a very talented college hurdler that later he found out couldnt read paul then finds out that mr leonard was kicked out of college and coundt get into another one because he couldnt read
the background information effects paul because it shows paul what mrleonard was when he was at his age they both had problems with reading and they both were good runners paul learns that mrleonard gotten kicked out of college for not being able to read and had to give up his scholarship this is what effects paul and he would learn from mrleonard mistakes and become a better reader
finding out about mr leonards past has a big effect on paul it makes paul feel less alone because mr leonard really does know what he is going through in pharagraph 25 paul says that he understands what mr leonard went through in high school and college this new knowledge shows paul just how much mr leonard helped him because of this paul decides to help mr leonard
mr leonard couldnt read either he was in the same position as paul when he was a kid

when paul found out about mr leonard he was empathetic the emotions they both had was all too familiar and paul has had the feelings also
whos paul
when paul gets mrleonard background informantion he is some what concerned about why mrleonard didnt tell paul about his pastpaul didnt judge him any different about him not being a good reader nor dropping out of collegepaul just returns the help that mrleonard gave ti him and tell mrleonard to go back to school
paul is emberassed about not being going to the learning center and it dont seem like he really wanted to tell him where he was going  mr leonard tries to help him with some stuff i gym because he gets picked last
the effect it has on paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion  it motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like mr leonard had  it also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what mr leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach mr leonard how to read
after mr leonard tells paul about the past the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to paul he then feels that mr leonard has given his time to help him so he does the same for mr leonard
the background information surprises paul because this man was helping him at a highschool instead of running for a team himself  he did not expect the man to be famous he also learns how mr leonards lack of ability to read had limited him and inspires him to keep trying
the effect it had on paul was it made him understand mr leonard better and it brought them closer
it has a really good effect on paul he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background niether of them could read and both good at track they helped eachother out
paul has trouble reading as did mr leonard mr leonard knows how it feels but does not want to mislead or discourage paul so he tries to teach him what he learned a long time ago by training him to be the best he can be
the information effects paul because mr leonard cant read and neither can paul mr leonard wants paul to be able to read because he never got the chance to learn how and he also knows that paul will be very good at running track
when mr leonard told paul about him being a star athelete in college but his grades werent good enough therefore he flunked out he started to feel bad for him
paul knows that mr leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too he knows hes not the only person that cant read if you can achieve a goal you can do anything
paul is shocked that mr leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read he soon caught on that mr leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read but was getting help for it unlike mr leonard did     in conclusion at the end of the short story paul states                cmon mrleonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training  now paul is going to assist mrleonard with his reading
that stuff was going on behind his back and stuff was being said and he found out from different sources people and then it made a conflict within many people
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard was familiar mr leonard didnt have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading paul was already getting help with his grades and reading before mr leonard started training him for track and field mr leonard didnt have help with his grades he is helping paul become the athlete that mr leonard used to be paul and mr leonard have had very similar childhoods
paul learns that mr leonard used to be a hurdler in college and that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he asks mr leonard what happened after that mr leonard explains that he couldnt read and that he flunked out of college it reminded paul of the feelings of embarassment when he didnt know an answer that everyone else did or when he was call upon to read out loud

when pual finds out about mr leonard flunking out of college because he cant read he feels sympothy and he knows how mr leonard feels the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar i knew them well  feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew paul p 45
it gives paul away to see mr leonard as an equal paul now can see why mr leonard is helping him and is thankful paul then sees how he himself can pay back mr leonard by teaching him to read
this background information helps paul realize why mr leonard was helping him out before knowing that mr leonard was a college track star paul didnt really have a reason for why he went out of his way to work with him paul also makes another realization when he finds out that mr leonard had trouble reading and learning just like he did
the background information paul recieves about mr leonard actually encourages him to strive to excel in his track and field in fact it boosts his confidence the reader knows that mr leonards story has touched paul when he realizes inside of his head that his mentor was just like him when he was younger then paul decides to encourage mr leonard
the background information that the narrator finds on paul brings the two characters closer  when the narrator finds out that paul was a track star he is even more inspired but when paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down  you know this because pauls voice trails off and he feels not go enough
he the narrator finds out that mr leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades
this effected paul because he saw how the hall monitor helped him succeed in a sport so he wanted to help the hall monitor read paul connected leonard because they both had a hard time reading  once paul knew leonard couldnt read that well he decides to teach him as leonard tought paul leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school
the effect that the background information has on paul about mr leonard is similar to pauls own life paul was one of the few selected to go to the learning center and then when paul found out that mr leonard flunked college that effect gave them simularities the effect made paul want to work harder and he took mr leonard to the learning center with him
he is black mailing him
the effect of the background information was that paul was understanding of how it feels to be the outcast that can not read and needed the extra help i believe that only made paul respect him more and relate to him more even though mr leonard was ashamed of his disablity paul was accepting because he could relate      also it gave paul the opportunity to return a favor to mr leonard paul was able to help out mr leonard and maybe teach him how to read better this causes their relationship to become more of an equal respect

1 it givesshows paul confidence and a lot of answers in life he figured out why mr leonard asked him what his name was even though he read his hall way pass everyday also whenever mr leonard asked paul if he plays basketball he said no so he took him out to the track where he is a suprerstar at mr leonard was just like paul but he wants paul to succsed in life and college
paul finds out that mr leonard jumped herdles in college and paul now belives that he can do it as well
mr leonard is a hall monitor that becomes a coach for the school
he was suprised in fact he pulled out the document about mr leonards accomplishment and showed it to him it confuses paul because mrleonard didnt seem happy about seeing the printout it turned out that mrleonard was a great at hurdles but wasnt the best student because he couldnt read
the information makes paul relize that mr leonard is like him in many ways and that he must try hard to do his best
the background information on mr leonard helped paul realize things about him  he also realizes that mr leonard is just trying to be his friend because they have been through the same stuff  when paul understands that mr leonard is a cool guy he lightens up and accepts him
paul has sympathy for mr leonard because they both have problems with learning they both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out mr leonard struggles with reading paul decides to take mr leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read he does this because he is returning a favor mr leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that paul would help him out with reading
the effect that has on paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards mr leonard  paul understands how mr leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading  the fact of how mr leonard explains how hard it was to accomplish homework made paul feel a connection of similar problems  thats because paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done  plus this makes paul understand how he could turn out if he didnt learn adequate reading skills to not flunk out like mr leonard

it encourages him to teach mr leonard how to read
the background information that paul finds about mr leonard allows him to empathize with and understand why mr leonard is helping him he realizes that mr leonard knows what paul himself is going through and decides to help mr leonard just as mr leonard helped him
when paul gets the infornmation of mrleonard from the url paul is quite amzed that mrleonard was an amzing track athlete mr leonard broke records and won the 400 meter national title and paul dosnt understand why he is a hall moniter that is until mr leonard confeces that he cannot read after that moment paul tells mrleonard that it is his time to learn
mr leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college mr leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for mr leonard to keep his grades up in college mr leonard doesnt want paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild this will help paul try harder to learn to read in middle school
he is shockt that h dose not no how to read
it gave paul hope that some day he would be able to read it also helped paul understand that mr leonard could not read so he would help be able to read
the information that is found on mr leonard is a big impact on paul he sees that anyone can do anything if they have help in high school mr leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades werent as outstanding as his sports were mr leonard was only givin a scholarship based upon his sports not his grades mr leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that couldt read paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help mr leonard just as he helped him
that paul realizes that mr leonard was a track star in college that funked out because he couldnt read so paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways
paul found out that mr leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles paul later found out that mr leonard was flunked out of college because he didnt know how to read paul related to this because he himself doesnt know how to read and he knows the feeling of embarrassment that mr leonard had paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read
paul sees himself in the background information he found about mr leonard  paul becomes empathatic towards mr leonard who can not read and in the fortysixth paragraph paul foreshadows that he will teach mr leonard how to read such as mr leonard taught paul how to run in track
the effect is that paul realizes that he is going ot be just like mr leonard who cant read and flunks out of college but amazing at track and had scholarships so paul says cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training this is said to mr leonard to return the favor andfor paul realizing how much help mr leonard has done for him
paul find out that mrleonard was a very good track runner and it made him excited and asked him what happen after that mrleonard then tells him he was not a good student and paul could relate to it paul then realized what he can do for him
paul learns that he must keep working hard and going to the learning center for help or being a good runner is not going to get you anywhere paul could see the saddness in mr leonards face about when he would talk about his ruunning and then how he flunked out of college because the work was so hard he couldnt keep up
the effect about the background information that has on paul was shocking because he didnt know he was a track and field champion he realized he wants to be more like him when paul ask him about his background mr leonard told him that he did but that he didnt do so good in school after mr leonard told him it made paul realized that it he was just like him when he was pauls age
he see mr leonard differently after he reseaches him on the internet but not in a bad way now he sees mr leonard as someone who understands what he is going through in class when asked to read out loud or not knowing an answer everyone else knows
when paul reads about mr leonards life at college he realizes that he and mr leonard are the same and that mr leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had he connects with him and feels sorry for him so paul then helps coach mr leonard in reading which is a lesson mr leonard has yet to learn
during the story paul gets background information about mr leonard it caused some effect on paul once he knew     paul finds out that mr leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school but like paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out     it had an effect on paul because paul had a hard time in school too but it made him realize that if he has help and tries his absolute best then paul could do really well in school and become better and better at hurtles
well he didnt know what to think about he had all these questions to ask mr leonard he had asked him why he hadnt told him about this and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team he had asked why he had stopped running mr leonard simply replied i was a good athlete but not a good student
the effect that the background information of mr leonard had on paul was that he was surprised because mr leonard hadnt told him anything about it let alone mention it when paul had found out that mr leonard flunked college because he had reading problems and the homework was to hard for him to understand he knew that it was his turn to help improve mr leonards reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling
it shows who he was really training with when he did not realize it before if he would have known mr leonard was a former hurdle runner who ran state he might have felt bad if he did not do good one day then he realized mr leonard helped so he should help him with his reading
he is sad he remembers back when he was doing that in highschool he tells paul about how he use to couldnt read
when paul finds out about mr leonards background he begins to understand how it relates to him and not being able to read he finds that the emotions in mr leonards words were all to familiar they both felt embarrassment and mr leonard gave him time to excel in something which was the track hurdles
paul now feels that he can still make achieve his goals even if he cant read seeing that mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter heurdle at the nationlas made paul realize that anything is possible
when paul finds out about mr leonards background paul can relate well to him paul realizes that mr leonard had given up his own time to help paul with track and now paul says its his turn to help mr leonard
their are many effects that paul recieves after learning about mr leonards past after hearing mr leonards past story paul believes now that he needs to work hard at learning how to read he also finds information about  mr leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race this effected paul because he didnt understand how after college he became a hall monitor he was so successful mr leonard explained to him i was a good athlete but not a good student we had no learning centers in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard this impacted paul into teaching mr leonard about high school and decided to step up cmon mr leonard its time to start your training
paul is suprised at what he finds because lenard didnt  tell hima nyhting about his past and paul found out for himself
it makes him feel that he owed mr lenard so he is willing to help him read after mrlenard helped him with the track
paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too  paul finds out that mr leonard cant read just as paul cant he decides that since mr leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach mr leonard to read
paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about mr leonard the next day after finding the information about mr leonard he asked him about it mr leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what paul had even though he felt embarrassed by the past he still answered paul     after listening to mr leonard explain his past he felt familiar with the feelings paul felt inspired he then asked mr leonard to come with him so paul could then help mr leonard just like he done for paul
he has always looked up to mr leonard so when he found out all the things that had happen to himin college i think at first he was shocked but then he heard more paul had kind of realized that mr leonard was like him when he was his age i just think it make paul and mr leonard closer
the background information on mr leonard is like how he was good at track in college and he actually flunks out of college which there for he cant do track and field anymore
it has an effect because paul does not want to lose a scholarship if he gets one
he doesnt want to be like mr leonard and be good at a sport then fail school
paul can relate to how mr leonard feels he has felt the same way before and still does in school in a way the two are very much alike in more than one way both are very well runners but fail to excel in school this makes pual want to help himself and mr leonard by putting mr leonard through a different type of training reading
he is very surprised he is like him he is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself when he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesnt know what to think its like he didnt even believe him at first he is amazed to see how far he has come
mr leonard used to be a track coach
the background information on mr leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to paul as mr leonard went on about his college life paul finds out that mr leonard is remedial to reading also they have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation
paul towards the end of the story is informed that mr leonard was a college track star mr leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading he also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills this allowed paul to see that him and mr leonard were similar mr leonard effected paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle
the effect the information has on paul is that he is just like mr leonard he relizes that mr leonard is trying to help him be the best he can be he relizes that he can over come his reading problem and can learn to read just like he has learned to do the hurtles
paul learned about mr leonard from the website that the track coach had written down for him the website gave paul some background information on mr leonard and this helped paul relate to mr leonards situation as a fellow student who could not read the information also made paul feel more emotionally attached to his trainer as in paragraph 45 where he knew the feelings of embarrassment the background information had an emotional effect on paul that helped him relate to mr leonard
the effect that mr leonards background has on paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him  paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read now paul wants too help mr leonard learn how too read
the background information on mr leonard shows paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things before the background information is given paul failed to see the connection that he had with mr leonard after paul learns more about mr leonards past he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons mr leonard is helping him
when paul hears mrleonards background information he starts to understand why mr leonard helps him also he kinda connects with mrleonard because he met and adult thats is and was in the same place that hes in they both had the same feelings when it came to reading
paul began to realize how much his teacher mr leonard and he had in common paul was just now learning why this man had came to him in the first place he couldnt possibably know what mr leonard wanted with him so paul was in surpirse with him or maybe a little disapointed that he wasnt giving the information or the insight on his mentor
during the story the reader gets information about mr leonards track records  paul now knows that mr leonard was once a wonderful track star and he is now helping paul become better  the background information that has the greatest effect on paul is that mr leonard has a reading problem just like him  mr leonard helped paul to become better at hurdles now paul wants to help mr leonard become better at reading
in the story paul finds out mr leonard was a famous track runner in college then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldnt read it makes paul feel like he can relate to someone he even says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar as if he knows exactly how mr leonard feels
the infromation that paul finds out makes him feel sorry for mr leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also  this is why at the end of the story paul decides to help teach mr leonard how to read
it effects paul because he can relate to mr leondards story bad reading skills trained to get good at track etc in a way i think it motivates paul to become good at track but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level
mr leonards background information effected paul by making him realize that he and mr leonard are similar this is because both have stuggled with reading paul can relate to mr leonard because in pargraph 45 paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldnt read aloud the answer
the background information he recieves from his track coach to research about mr leonard gives paul a whole new way to look at mr leonard paul discovers that mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals he discovered he broke records and asked mr leonard about his past life the information paul soon recieves from mr leonard has a great impact on him this is so by mr leonard also not being able to read like paul although they didnt have service learning centers back then therefore paul decides to help mr leonard begin to start reading
during the story paul finds out about mr leonards past as a college hurdler paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well he felt that it was fair to help mr leonard after all mr leonard had helped paul discover that he could excel in hurdles paul then led mr leonard back to the school with the intent to teach mr leonard how to read
one effect that learning about mr leonards track history had was giving paul the idea to help mr leonard to read since mr leonard helped paul paul wants to help mr leonard     knowing his past could have also given paul a reason to excel in track since mr leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete paul might want too prove himself to mr leonard and himself that he can succeed also if paul succeeds mr leonard does too since he taught paul everything
mrleonard is a classic exsampel of a person who is focast on his sport and not on his grades only to find out later in life that he needed the grades more than the sport
you can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on like the hurdle the first time paul did them
mr leonard is kind of like paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and mr leonard wants paul to succeed in life he wants paul to have the oppurtiunity that he didnt
paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he cant read well and at first didnt play any sports he seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades paul learns that mr leonard was a great athlete but didnt know how to read this makes paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete this seems to make paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage mr leonard to start learning to read
i belive that the background information that paul found out about mr leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in
he went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but mr leonard didnt graduate because he couldnt read
well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also this in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same but without the flunking college thing also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess
the background information made paul wonder why mr leonard was a hall monitor mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it paul was surprised to hear how mr leonard couldnt read that he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read
paul is very suprised that mrleonard had not told him about how he was a college track star paul asked him why didnt you tell me about this
when paul found out that mr leonard did hurdles in collage  38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he was very enthused
the background information about mr leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with paul paul has troubles reading and so does mr leonard paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport     mr leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read so everyone choose him last in every sport mr leonard came cobncerned when he stopped paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read     both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was
he probably didnt know that mr leonard ran track and broke many records he had to keep that a secret from paul so his hopes wouldnt come crashing down just because he couldnt read he didnt want that to happen to paul
he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionhe relizes all of this when mr leonard says that no school wanted a runner who couldnt read
that mrleonard is a good and talented athlete but a very poor reader paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read finding out about mr leonard pushes paul to read and work hard
it effects paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in school he knows this now because mr leonard dropped out of college because he couldnt make the grades even though he had scholarships
when paul received information about mr leonard he was shocked he did not know that he was a record breaking track runner or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage
the background information that paul gets from mr leonard helps motivate him  it might make paul really work on his reading  even though paul is still young his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like mr leonard and for that he wouldnt want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either  you can tell by that from when he tells mr leonard cmon mr leonard its time you start your training
when paul realizes that mr leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that  mr leonard states but not a good student 42  by saying this paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing does not mean you shouldnt try anything else  mr leonard should have tried in school and paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone  also it taught paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses
pau  is a trsck player in high school still hes trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments also hes a very fast runner to
i will write about why i feel that what paul found out about mr leonard effects him in anyway     i think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teachercoach when he told mr leonard about the url he reccived mr leonard told paul about his past thats why i think that what paul found out about mr leonard effects they basically have the same issuses in their lifes     another reason why i feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to mr leonard and paul can understand how he feels paul and mr leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teachhelp mr leonard at reading also
it makes paul feel like he needs to help mr leonard on his reading
he takes paul to different places to see what hes interested in and he found it by going out on the track
the background information paul gets on mr leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner  because paul like mr leonard can not read very well and doesnt want to end up dropping out of college like mr leonard did
the background information had a great effect on paul it did because paul had not realized who mr leonard was and wanted to know more when mr leonard told him about his college struggles and his ability to not read well paul felt like he could help in the end mr leonard helped motivate paul to try hurdling just like paul helped motivate mr leonard to learn to read for the first time this effected paul by helping him gain a new friend and trainer
mr leonards background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else this kind of reputation encouraged paul to simply and blankly do as mr leonard told him it even encouraged paul to obey mr leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field
when paul learns of mr leonards past he is encouraged because mr leonard could not read but still broke records in track paul also want to return the kindness mr leonard has shown him so paul is going to teach mr leonard how to read
the effect that the background information has on paul is that it makes paul more sensitive to why mr leonard has been pushing and training him
it tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story
throughout the story there are times when you suspect that mr leonard is just like paul when they are at the track and mr leonard asks for pauls name is a good sign that mr leonard cannot read either mr leonard sees in paul the likeness and commoness that they share the effect it has on paul is the support he gets from someone just like him paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time mr leonard wants to help paul out but the only way for him to help is if paul lets him paul may not know exactly what mr leonard went through right off the bat but little by little paul finds out and it motivates paul to be a better person athlete and harder worker
the background information about mr leonard helps paul believe that he can get better in track knowing that mr leonard was a college hurdler
paul was disapointed with mr leonard paul showed this by saying why didnt you tell me about this after paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him paul wants to do better then mr leonard
paul cant read and neither could mr leonard so when mr leonard starts training paul he doesnt tell him his story because he doesnt want him to discouraged and stop when paul does find out his story he asked about it mr leonard explained it to him and inspired paul to help him at the end of the story paul takes mr leonard to his reading class and says its time to start your training since mr leonard helped paul he returns the favor
paul realizes that mr leonard has trouble reading just like him also paul understands why mr leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because mr leonard didnt want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college
paul does research and realizes that mr leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year when he questions mr leonard what happened to him leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read this touches paul because he cannot read either it makes him feel much more comfortable around leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar hurdles in life
the background information about mr leonard that paul heard was touching to him he knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment an example of how paul knew those feelings where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know an answer that everyone else knew i think paul could really relate to mr leonard and also so could mr leornard relate to paul since mr leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out he wants to teach him how to read
when paul recieved the background information he had questions for mr leonard  paul wondered why mr leonard didnt tell him that he was a college track superstar  therefore paul asked mr leonard that exact question the next day
the information paul found could have discourage him as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by mr leonard  just by paul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot
paul was shock to discover that his caoch was the best runner in college his freshman year paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about mr leonard achievement when paul discovered what happen he was sad  now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like mr leonard
when paul figures out what happen to mr leonard when he was in high school and college showed him that they were both alike he believed that mr leonard was trying to show him that anything is possible
he highly apriciates what mr leonard has done for him now knowing mr leonard has the same problem as he does he wants to help him out just like mr leonard helped him
during the story when paul recieves the information about his coach mr leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first this assumption is made through paul asking questions about mrleonards college days his feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question  why didnt you tell me about this     however after mrleonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through paul ultimately feels like he owes mrleonard  and deciedes to train him 
the effect that the background information that paul is provided with is that paul realizes that if he tries hard he can become successful when the highschool coach gives paul the opportunity to get information on mr leonard he takes it paul then confronts mr leonard to ask why he did not go on to do greater things mr leonard then tells paul that he had learning issues like him and encourgages paul to try his best so he does not end up like mr leonard
he weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help mrleonard
that you can do anything if you put your mind to it and you dont have to be smart to do big things in life
the background information that paul finds about mr leonard has an effect on him he didnt know at the beginning that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals      mr lenonard didnt want to tell paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him he wouldnt want to train or try something new however if paul had known things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training      the saying dont judge a book by its cover has meaning here mr leonard is the book and just because hes the hall monitor doesnt meant that he didnt have a successful past paul getting to know mr leonard was a way for him to become someone
paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star
it kind of shows him what kind of person mr leonard was back then
paul is effected by finding out mr leonards backround as a star in track is paul becomes inspired to do well in track just like mr leonard
the effect the background information has on paul is to show that they are alike paul does not know how to read and struggles in class by learning mr leonards background information he sees that mr leonard also had a hard time in school and could not read it also helps him understands that he is not the only one and knows that mr leonard understands how paul feels
that he wanted to help mr leonard with his challenge of readingit said that no other school wanted a runner who could not readso that  mr lenord can go to college to complete his goal
i think that mr leonards background information has a big effect on paul i think this because before mr leonard actually talked to paul paul had no idea what mr leonards past life was like in sentence thirty eight paul said this you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records this makes me think that paul will try harder at everything he does just because he found out about mr leonards past
he begins to understand why mr leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted paul to do well in track but also do well in school
he feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff now he wants to help him out
when paul learns about what mr leonard used to be he is suprised you know this by how he shows mr leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38 but he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45
it makes paul and mr loenard better friends because he was helping him train and he was being very good to him and paul was being good and progressing very well and when he found out about his trainer he wanted to help him just like his trainer helped him
paul was a great athlete but he cound not read paul didnt know who mr leonard was and mr leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport
paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 230
when paul learns about mr leonards past hes at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well that encourged paul to work harder at reading and teach mrleonard how to read better just like he taught paul to be a athlete
once paul discovers mr leonards background it makes him feel stronger he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read he sees that he is not alone that information pushed paul to strive for the better in the hurdles and at reading he sees that he has more oppurtunities than mr leonard did and decideds to take advantage of them for the better
paul understand how mr leonard feels because of paul own experiences he is going through in his life paul experiences some of the feeling with mr leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him but he didnt know the answer to the question
the background story of mr leonard is something that is familiar to paul mr leonard had went through school not knowing how to read he had a difficult time throughout high school and college he had nobody to help him paul has help from both his tutor and mr leonard he feels as if all the help leonard has given he should return some of it paul wants to help him just as he helped paul
the background information paul gets on mr leonard makes him want to help mr leonard because he helped him
when paul does background check on mr leonard he is very suprised at what he finds paul learns that mr leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship when paul told mr leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements when paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels
because he wants him to find out everything about track and field and then he finds out mr leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college as a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college and no one wanted a runner that couldnt read so he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldnt be like mr leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field so he can be on the team just like him back in the day
paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for mr leonard when mr leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions
paul was working on his hurdling and the high school track coach came up and talked to him paul got a url for the track and field website and the coach said do a search for grabowski which grabowski is the guy that has been training paul to be good at hurdles once paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that grabowski did
in what paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that mr leonard was a track star in high school and confused that mr leonard didnt tell him it also probably suprised him that mr leonard didnt become famous because he couldnt read because earlier in the story he was confused because mr leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions
paul finds out that mr leonard was a college track star that broke many records then a while later paul has a conversation with him mr leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasnt a good student this relates to paul because he cant read that well
paul had the same problem as mr leonard he knew how it felt not to read he wanted to help mr leonard since he helped him
mrleonard began walking back toward the schoolthen turned and asked
i think it motivated paul to do better in school and do be the best at track that he could be
paul thinks that sense mr leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike mr leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read so mr leonard seen he was trying and it made him proudjust because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life
its surprises him a lot when he is asking mr leonard why was he hiding that from him
paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but later he finds out that mr leonard and him are not so different because in mr leonards past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too
after paul learns mr leonards history paul realizes that mr leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals mr leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life he is concerned for paul paul then understands that he must overcome his weakness in reading because he doesnt want to give up like mr leonard had
from the stroy paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading in a simmular background mr leonard was a excelling track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels from mr leonards past he dosent whant to have someone repeating his failures
the effect the background information has on paul is understanding paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read and if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunitys that will never come again paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read so that he isnt embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life
the backround information effected paul because it made him feel like he can come over any obsticle in life paul came to conclusions that he can achieve anything if he put effort into it once he read on mr leonard background that gave him motivation to accomplish his goals
mr leonard was a great athlete in school but not a great student mr leonard struggled when it came to school and didnt have the help he needed to be a better student his friends helped him out a little but once he got to college everything got harder mr leonard had problems with reading just like paul mr leonard shows paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school just because paul has a har time reading doesnt mean he cannot be sucessful in sports paul is lucky enough to have tutors and someday paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out mr leonards dream
it shows paul a different side of life also its helps motivate him to keep goin it make s him want to help mrleonard plus its something that paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like mrleonard
the background information that paul recieves helps him to see why mr leonard was helping him and pushing him
the background information that paul has recieved is shocking  paul had no clue that mr leonard was so good at hurdles  paul wonders why that he didnt go pro and didnt finish college out
the background information mr leonard told paul took an effect on him paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship like mr leonard but graduate its teaching paul a lesson that your education is what really matters
he questions him about it he wants to know why he stoped
when he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes he realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him yet then he finds out that he cant read this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since mrleonard taught him well its time to teach him something
the background information on mr leonard had a motivating effect on paul because mr leonard had the same problem as paul who was also a great runner
the effect that the background information has on paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast you can always be a success in something
the information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as mr leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do
when paul learns about mr leonards past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading he said that mr leonards emotions were familiar to him so now he will work hard to help himself and leonard
he waas really surprized that mrleonard was a collage athlete and he broke recordswhen mrleonard told paul that he wasnt a good reader he couldnt under satnd why not untill mrleonard explaned to him the situation that the scoots told him not to worry about the grades just worry about the sport and he failed his classes and mrleonard had to drop out mrleonard wants to set a goal for paqul to achevie
paul realizes that mr leonard feels the same way he does about reading  he wants to help mr leonard to become a better reader just like mr leonard is helping him with track
paul is motivated by the information because mr leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something  paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because mr leonard cant read like paul  paul is then motivated to invest time in mr leonard teaching him something that he doesnt know how to do
when paul learns the backgroiund information of mr leonard it motivates him to excel both in track and field as well as in school in addition to motivating paul the backgroiund of mr leonard also inspires him to do well in everything he does and gives him the idea to help mr leonard back
before paul finds the background information over mr leonard he doesnt really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor after he finds it though he feels compelled to help mr leonard learn to read the parallel at the end of the story between mr leonard helping out paul in the beginning and paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact mr leonards background information had on paul
when he learns the background information paul realizes that he understands the feelings that mr leonards words were having he understood how he was embarrassed that he couldnt read and that he went after something he could excel at thats why paul said he had something he could do for mr leonard
he knew how he felt because he was in the same situation he helped him get help at the learning center
paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
the background information makes paul curious at first it makes him wonder why mr leonard didnt tell him about his past it made him question mr leonard about why he didnt share the information it also makes him wonder why mr leonard didnt make it any farther with the sport it brought up the conversation between the two of them when paul found out about the whole story behind mr leonards track career
that mr lenoard was a godo athlete but he didnt do good in school so he got fluncked and he wants to help the narator so that he can do good in school and have a succesful careere
after hearing the story mr leonard has to say about his past the narrator feels empathy for mr leonard and understands what he went and still is  going through the backgrrround story really brought them closer together because it made the narrrator feel like mr leonard isnt so much of a stranger but someone a lot like him
that paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor mr leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best thats been training him on the track everyday from going to the learnign center during the week and then having mr leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him then mr leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center then paul looks at mr leonard and says you have training to do
he finds out that mr leonard was a college track star and wonders why he didnt tell him about it in the story he asks mr leonard why didnt you tell me about this
during the story paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star and that he went to college and ran hurdles but he also finds out that mr leonard didnt do well in school so paul can kind of relate to this i think that this helps paul realize that he could be good at something too
he figures out that mr leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then mr leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldnt read so paul then realizes why mr leonard took such interest in him after school paul then decides to teach mr leonard how to read
the background information that paul discovers about mr leonard makes him suspicious of why mr leonard did not tell paul about his past  paul finds it odd that mr leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star  after finding the background information about mr leonard paul says to him why didnt you tell me about this you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals  you broke records  paul says this to mr leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments  surprisingly paul learns that mr leonard is more like himself then he realized  paul discovers one of mr leonards most emabarassing secrets that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college  paul then realizes why mr leonard asked him his name that first day at the track he was never able to read pauls name on his hall pass  after learning about mr leonards past it motivates paul to work even harder at school and at track  it also gives paul the idea to teach mr leonard how to read  mr leonards background information made paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything
in the story paul finds out the mr leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records he also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner when paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone this motivates paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the learning center it also gives him the motivation to tutor mr leonard at the end of the story he thinks that it is time for mr leonard to learn how to read
paul feels bad for mrleonard because he never learned how to read but he was a good althete paul gave him the schudule and he could not read itwhen he was in hight school they did not having a learning center like they did paul is going to teach him how to read
the background information on  mrleonard helped paul uner stand why leonaed trained paul in track
paul was shocked to find out that mr leonard was a hurdler in college that information motivated paul to be a better hurdler it made the bond that paul and mr leonard shared stronger
paul realizes that mr leonard is just like him  when paul sees who mr leonard really is he is shocked  you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles ar the nationals  your broke records  paul now sees that mr lenard did know what he was talking about when he was teaching him to jump hurdles
paul realizes that mr leonard cant read just like himself so paul now understands why mr l told him to meet him after school paul then realizes what he could do for mr l
the effect of the background information has on paul is that he is that he can relate to mr leonard the feelings of embarrassment were familiar to him when he was called on to real aloud in class this effects paul because he is more motivated to succeed in something and also help mr leonard in return
at the beginning of the story paul thinks that mr leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble then he helps paul learn the hurdles and paul begins to like him when the track coach told paul to search for mr leonard on the internet paul learns that mr leonard has a learning disability just like he does this helps paul to know that he isnt the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read paul also realized that mr leonard helped him become so good at something in return paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read
the information connects paul with mr leonard and shows how they are similar like the feelings of embarrassmentit also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time which makes paul want to help him read
the effect that the background information has on paul is that he was so amazed that mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didnt tell him about it  the effect really sinks into to paul that mr leonard was just like him paul states this man had given his time to help me excel at something this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help paul achieve something great and right then paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to mr leonard by helping him train again
paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a track star once he finds this out he wonders why mr leonard did not tell him about his past he asks mr leonard what happened after the race and found out that he flunked out of college because he could not read paul knows what it is like not being able to read so he is willing to help mr leonard as mr leonard has helped him
paul is amazed at mr leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner paul also finds out about mr leonards weakness as a reader and wants to help him strengethen that weakness as mr leonard helped paul in his weakness for track
paul found out that mrleonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
paul is happy an shocked at the same time he didnt know that mr leonard was a track star mr leonard trained paul so now paul wants to train mr leonard to read
when the track caoch gives paul the url and tells him too look up mr leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good when mr leonard told paul the reson why he cant do it anymore is because he didnt know how to read and flunked out of college it reminded paul of himself because he didnt know how to read and goes to a tutor hey  my friend where do you think your going learning center why because i dont know how to read
when paul comes in with background information about mr laonard his coach is initially is reliving his glory days as a young talented athelete but as he continues to tell his story he begins to feel sad in paragraph 41 it says mr leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround his brow furrowed his voice cracked as he spoke this indicates that paul bringing back this information really had an effect on mr leonard he was embarrased at the fact that he couldnt read but he knew that because paul was a slow reader himself he knew paul could relate
mr leonard was just like paul he could not read but he could run just like paul mr leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else he did not want to paul ot end up like himself he just wmated paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did
the boy who wanted to join the track team is or could be the best it could be some one else thou we will never know for shore
the background information causes paul to feel closer to mr leonard for example the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to mr leonard also paul now has something else in common with mr leonard a difficulty reading the background information also allows paul to return mr leonards favor of teaching him to run track paul can now teach mr leonard how to read and do well in school
the effect that paul recieved from getting information about mr leonard is that paul had felt the same exact way paul knew what he was talking about since mr leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles he felt as if he should help him how to read so paul took him down to the learning center so mr leonard could know how to read
he sees that mr leonard used to be a track star
getting mrleonards information has a big effect on paul
paul was surprised that mr leonard was a great hurdler runner and became inspired after mr leonard told him he had to lose his scholarship and flunk out because he couldnt read paul could relate to him by remembering his feelings of embarrassment when he was called on to read and didnt know an answer everyone else knew
the narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track when he realized that mr leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles but couldnt read paul realized that mr leonard had the same experience he was having paul then wanted to help mr leonard with reading in the same way mr leonard helped him with track
the background information effects paul because now he knows why mr leonard wants to help him be successful because mr leonard had been a great runner but couldnt read he wanted paul to possess the skills he had in running but he also wanted paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself since paul knows that now he believes you should pay mr leonard back and help him with what he wasnt good at which is reading
the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him
i think that the back ground information that paul receives about mr leonard makes paul happy he now feels like he fits in with mr leonard since they share the same problem     for example after mr leonard tells paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story paul decides to help mr leonard learn how to read paul is happy because he fits in with mr leonard and because he can help mr leonard just like mr leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles
he learns that mr leonard is the same as him  i was a good athlete but not a good student and paul is the same way he can not read and struggles with his homework paul is going to help mr leonard
paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that mr leornard was doing this to help him because he didnt want paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because mr leonard went through the same situations that paul is going through right now
the background information makes paul feel more confortable with mr leonard he now knows him and mr leonard are more alike than what he thought in the beginning of the story paul thought leonard was just some hall monitor that was crazy about checking passes by the end of the story he realized they have a lot in common as in they both have trouble in school reading and they are both good at hurdles i think leonard became an inspiration for paul to try to succeed and do better than what leonard did
paul is overwhelmed with the information he finds out about mr leonard no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read says mr leonard paul realizes that mr leonard went through the same stuff that paul is going through paul and mr leonard are the same and paul is surprised
after realizing mr leonards story paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him  he sees mr leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him  when he tells mr leonard that it was time for his training he was going to try and teach him how to read better  it effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy
the background information about mr leonard influences paul  it helps to give him the motivation he needs to become a remarkable athelete  his struggle with reading lowered his selfesteem but when he discovered that mr leonard also had struggles paul felt more confident  the narrator says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me paragraph 45  when he states this he is informing us that he sympathizes for mr leonard
paul knows how he feels and how embarrassing that it was when you couldnt read or understand stuff  now that paul knows mr leonards history paul decides to help him by teaching him how to read
mr leonard flunked out of collage because he couldnt read and no other collages would take a runner who cant read
the effect the background information has on paul made him astounded that mr leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has paul was happy that he made a new friend in mr leonard
that mrleonard cant read just like paul and mrleonard was a runner so he teaches paul to run like he did when he was in school
mr leonard was a hall monitor  doing his job helping  kids out so that they can read just like helped paul do
the information about mr leonard led to paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team  mr leonard was a star in college but he still could not read paul knew that he couldnt read but he is able to keep trying due to the learning centers at his school if he learned how to read well enough he may earn a scholarship and run hurdles in college with the proud feeling of being able to read
paul was astonished of mr leonards accomplishments saying that he was a college freshmen running the 400 meter hurdles and winning at nationals mr leonard tells paul that he could not read when he was in school which is ironic because paul couldnt either the difference was the paul had a tutor and back then mr leonard had no tutors when he was in school so he had to drop out
it makes paul quizitive as to why mr leonard had quit running track and field when he puleed out the paper and showed it to him he started to ask mr leonard questions so that way he could comprehend what was happening
the background information shows that they both have trouble with reading
he is happy to heara aboout the past achivements od mrleonard it motivates him to want to waorkl hareder and better it made him relize what he could do for mrlenoard buy being a good racer
after paul learns mr leonards story it makes him more motivated to overcome his obstacles in life and do his best it inspires paul to be a great athlete like mr leonard was but it makes him realize that having an education is essential if he wants to keep being in track
during the story we get more and more information about mr leonard this information gives paul a better understanding on why and how mr leonard was able to give him such accurate training tips before the author started to give us information about mr leonard we were along with paul given hints into his past such as say whats your name when paul revieves all the bacground information all these hints become apparent and he understands why he was being helped
the background informatin on mr lenord gives him and paul a bond they can relate to each other because they both have trouble reading the background information makes when mr lenord said no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read paul feels like he is not alone and this makes him motivated to help mr lenord feel good about himself the way he did for him

it has at first a confusing effect he could read and he had no learning centers to get help and he ened up fluncking out of college and from there no other college wanted him
when paul finds the background information on mr leonard he seems to be shocked to find out how well mr leonard was in his college past leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records at the moment when mr leonard tells paul about his own struggles in school thats when he realized how he could help mr leonard back for all the help he gave to him
he knew how he felt which was feeling embarrassed around others when they had to read in class he thought of things to do for mr leonard and finally came up with something they walked back to school so he could train him try and make him feel better about himself and not focus on getting flunked out of college
the background information that paul got on mr leonard realated to himself paul wasnt very good at sports and was not at all an athlete and he couldnt read so he had to go to tutoring for help mr leonard was a very good athlete but couldnt read and never got any help so he flunked out of college and lost his scholarship this showed paul that he really needed to keep his head in school and do the best he could possibly do
the effect that the background information about mr leonard had on paul was that mr leonard was in the same boat as paul paul had a reading problem and the information about mr leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasnt able to read it shows paul that you have to do your school work and be good at it for you to do what you wish also it shows paul that he is not the only person with a reading disability and you can do anything if you set your mind to it
that he went to school with paul that mrleonard went to college with pauls dad
the backround information about mrleonard has an effect on paul because they both have had and do have trouble reading also paul feels like he is left out of sports and is always chosin last in sports so mrleonard decided to coach paul in track
when paul learns that mr leonard was a college track star who broke records in the hurdles but failed out of college because he couldnt read paul feels sympathetic towards mr leonard the symapthy that paul feels for mr leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills at the end of the story paul foreshadows that he will help mr leonard with his training or academics
the effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school just as mr leonard did in college it also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing you will not meet your expectations
the background information that mr leonard had given paul had really changed pauls life in one respect he felt sorry for his teacher but at the same time he also found inspiration in his teachers story      mr leonard tells how there was no learning center when he was in college he feels confindent that the learning center will help paul he is also glad that learning center is there to help people that are like himself
it makes him want to do better and wonders why mr leonard didnt tell him about his college years when he finds out he wants to help him in any way possible
paul was shocked that mr leonard was a track star when he went to high school when mr leonard told paul about him flunking out of college becuase he can not read i think paul relized that school was important and that he wanted to help mr lenard how to read
it reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading and that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center
paul was suprised that mr leonard wasnt good at rading he was shocked when he saw that mr leonard was a college track star but not a good student
mr leonard and paul were both not very good at in school later mr leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports paul understood the trouble and decided to take mr leonard in to a program just like when he took paul in because he was poor at sports
the effect on paul was like he was feeling sad for mr leonard beacus mr leonard was a good runner but he did not do very good in school i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
the background information paul gets about mrleonard helps paul to belive in hisself paul and mrleonard are just alike neither of them can read very good mrleonard tries to help paul become a better student and suceeds in returning the favor paul then starts training mrleonard so hell be able to read
the backgroud information that paul gets about mr leonard shows him that he can acomplish something if he tries for example when paul and mr leonard go to the track and start trianing the boy never thought he was good at anything and he always got rejected ended up he trained with the high school track team
i think paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that the hall monitor grabowski couldnt read that good himself so they had something in common
paul empathized with mr leonard because he knew how it felt to be the slow kid in class and it inspired him to help mr leonard learn to read
the reader in this story happens to get many gifts pretty much whatever he wants is what he gets there is not one thing the reader didnt get that he didnt want to get
paul was both surprised and upset about the background information he was surpised because he thought mr leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong he was upset because he thought mr leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past
after mr leonard pulled out a printout of his old highschool records from track paul seemed to be amazed after mr leonard shared to paul that he was a great athletebut school on the other hand didnt come easy to him he seemed to realize that maybe mr leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another
when paul finds our mr leonards past he was shocked paul was shocked because of what mr leonard has been doing for him how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life how he is trying to get paul to over come them he knows what paul is going through and he knows that nothing not even the small obstacles can stop a person who cant read
the effect that background information has on paul is that he is not a very good student in school
the background information helped paul know why mr leonard had helped him build his confidence and give him something he enjoys doing paul relates to mr leonard feelings of embarrassment since they both have trouble reading
he feels confident in the teachings mr leonard will give him in his sport of choice
paul is not exactly an average boy he doesnt really fit in and he cannot read mr leonard starts helping him in track once paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who mr leonard really was mr leonard girabowski a track star he broke records and even got a scholarship to college but it was all taken away from him because he could read paul could sympathize with this feeling the embarrassment when he didnt know the answer he was grateful for everything so he decided to return the favor paul was going to teach mr leonard to read
paul realizes that mr leonard is just like him mr leonard wants paul to understand that branching out will help him in the long run he does not need to be so shy by working hard paul can accomplish anything
the effect on paul is suprising to him he thought that a hall monitor would have never had a back ground like mr leonard had     although shcoked to hear about him through the website paul could relate very much to mr leonard and so could mr leonard thats why mr leonards gaze softened when paul said he couldnt read
paul didnt know that mr leonard was a college track and field athlete which affected him in som many ways
i think after paul read about mr leonard it pushed him harder to run and jump the hurdles for he was also impressing him and he knew if he worked hard at it like he does with his reawding hell be able to do it better everyday
the effect mr leonards background information had on paul was that paul began to feel a connection with mr leonard in the story paul stated that he believed he only did the hurdles at first because he was used to obeying mr leonard however after learning about mr leonard paul begins to see the similarities between them both worked hard and excelled atheletically but had trouble academically these similarities make paul empathetic toward mr leonard and wish to help the man
paul is somewhat bothered about how mr leonard didnt tell him about him running track i think paul will be more motivated to be on the track team so he can impress mr leonard and show him that he can overcome obstacles
the background information changes the way the reader looks at mrleonard he sees him now as a great athlete because he broke records in college
paul now knows why he is trying to train him mr leonard wants someone that was like him in high school do better then him and have a better chance in college not only in college but also in life
paul is just like mr leonard he is good at track but he cant read i think that it gives him motivation to work hard to learn how to read so he can succeed and keep doing track
the background information paul finds out about mr leonard seems to discourage him this is evident because when he was asking mr leonard about it he looked down at the ground and his voice cracked he felt that he had no hope since he was starting from scratch and mr leonard was a star athelete in high school and college
the effect that this information has on paul is tremendous becasue it shows that mrleonard is a person just like him in the story when mr leonard asks paul where he is going and he responds the learning center mrleonard just srugs it off because he knows he has been there another example is when mrleonard asks paul to meet him after school he is trying to hepl him in lifelastly mr leonard is discuraged when he is reminded of his past but when paul helps him he feels better
to let paul now that he has to do his best in school to have funny in sports and keep your grades up
paul didnt know how to speak to mrleonard because he was an track star and then dropped out of college paul also wanted to help mrleonard because he helped paul with all of his ability that he has now and paul is more outgoing paul got asked by the high school track coach to come and be on his team thats how paul got the information on mr leonard and wants to try and help him to be out of his comfort zone paul was effected by it because he didnt know that mr leonard was an great track star and he just wanted to help him like he did paul
the reader recieves background information about mr leonard throughout the story the reader knows that mr leonard is the hall monitor and keeps the kids moving shows an interest in students who struggle with school and used to be a track star         by being a hall monitor mr leonard is used to telling kids where to go and what to do the kids in return are used to obeying him thats why paul never quit when mr leonard made him do more work because he had been conditioned by hearing those words every day     mr leonard is empathetic towards paul because he knows what it feels like to not do well in school he even admits to paul the he lost my scholarship and flunked out      all of these examples give background information on mr leonard
when mr leonard told paul about his background history paul could relate they both had learning problems paul decided to help mr leonard learn to read since mr leonard helped him train for track
the background information makes paul feel as though mr leonard understands his problems he says that he knew mr leonards feelings well because he had often felt them it also makes him feel as though he can give back to him paul decides to teach mr leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts
when paul learns that mr leonard was a track star in college that ran hurdles and broke records he was stunded  paul confronted mr leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend  mr leonard responce was i was a good athlete but not a good student  i relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard  so now paul trys harder in school and on the track
whenever paul looked up all the acheivments that mr leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of what was a star athlete in paragraph 39 paul seems excited and impressed with all of leonards success
the effect that the background information has on paul is that he realizes mr leonard is just like him the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me paul is bothered by the fact that they are just a like he wants to do better now that he knows what mr leonard has been through      cmon mr leonard i said its time to start your training paul wants to help mr leonard out
he is surprised and puzzled that mr leonhard didnt share the information with him he also wants to learn more about him
mr leonardos background information relates to paul  paul knows what it is like to feel embarrassed when he does not know an answer everyone else knows or when he is called upon to read aloud  paul feels that he is similar to mr leonardo and has a desire to help mr leonardo
it made him fill bad
well he kinda got this feeling that when the teacher wrote him something on the paper saying url he kinda figure that mrleonard didnt know how to read but mrleonard told him that he was a good runner in that we went to college but when he went to college that he got bad grades and that he feild the hole course and that he didnt now how to read he saying that it was bad for him becasuse it was really hard for to read and that some people didnt understand him and that he felt like it was embarrassing to tell some thats about to be o the team of his that he sont now how to call the playsand when he stand up in front of the class an read a book and there some that he cant answer it and somebody have to do it for him but even thow mrleonard didnt now how to read he was able to help him get threw it now the boy can say that mrleonard was very exsired to him so he would never give up
i believe that paul was encouraged to see that mr leonard was once a track star and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough mr leonard showed paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time paul made that push happen
in paragraph 44 mr leonard said that his college scouts told him that his grades didnt matter he flunked out of school and no other school wanted a runner that wouldnt read
they both have an issue with reading and learning well mr leonard was quick to misconstrue why paul was in the hallway until he brought up an obstacle in mr leonards life also
mrleonards background infrormation has a similar effect on paul because he is going through the same thing mr leonard is going through paul goes to the learning center twice a week to learn how to read mr leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student mr leonard didnt have a learning center back then that would help him with his grades so paul understood how mr leonard felt he felt embarresed i think paul also felt that he wasnt the only one going through learning diableties
when paul discovers that mr leaonard was a track star and that he could not read i think that he was determined to do better
the effect of the background information has a very good effect in paul it makes him try to be a better person
he was confused about why mr leonard didnt tell him and why he kept his past a secret
it makes him feel proudi know this because the text saysyou were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals
the background information about mr leanard suprises paul this is because what he found was this mr leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles he went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles     paul wasnt aware of this and asked why mr leonard didnt tell paul because he couldnt read and flunked out of college after that nobody wanted a runner that could not read therefore mr leonard could not finish his runnning career      this would encourage paul to try hard to learn to read it will show him to never give up and always try your best in life

there was a very big effect from the background information given on mr leonard the biggest effect was by mrleonard sharing his past it shows that even if your not good at something dont give up just try even harder mr leonard said  no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read as mr leonard says this he also is showing paul that hey look i was such a good athlete but just because i couldnt read they didnt want me mr leonard did not want him to end up the same way
when paul learns of mr leonards background he instantly begins to look up to him  in paragraph 38 paul lists his acheivements as a track star  later in the story in paragrah 44 mr leonard tells him about how he flunked out of college because he couldnt read very well  this was something that paul could relate to  he knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given paul with the hurdles
mr leonard have to look at the background of paul because they have the same problem  at first paul didnt want to think about it and tell mr leonard to walk back toward school because it was his time to start training him and they helped each  other out and paul realized what he did for him  they made him feel very embarrassment about it because they would call on him and he didnt want to answer amd knew everybody else was better
paul is surprised that mrleonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger paul sees that mr leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible but then mrleonard tells paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help paul understands how he feels and decides to help mrleonard to read better since he helped him so much
he was surprised that mr leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage but at the same time he was also curious because he didnt know that mr leonard was a drop out paul asked why didnt you tell me about this mr leonard said i looked good back then didnt i then they started talking about the race mr leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage then mr leonard told paul about his school life and that he couldnt read either and that after he was a drop out no other collage wanted him

a first he was upset that he didnt tell him then was surprised because he had broken a record then asked more questions about what had happened why he stopped running
it effects paul because at first that he didnt know that mr leonard was an athlete after paul found out that mr leonard was an athlete that changed paul mr leonard told paul that he wasnt good at reading at all so after mr leonard helped pau out with his problem paul helped mr leonard with his problem
mr leonard is very encouraging he tells paul it was not a bad first effort and youll do better next time paul says he gets picked last all the time and is obviously effected by it because it says he didnt want to see more of that treatment out of school  therefore mr leonard was encouraging and didnt give up on him  this caused him to stick with it and stay confident

learning mr leonards background information paul becomes more interested in his life when mr leonard told paul about his difficulties in reading paul felt like someone finally knew how he felt and everything that he was saying was familiar to him since mr leonard had helped paul succeed in track and field paul decided that he would work with mr leonard and they would succeed in reading together
paul finds out that mr leonard was a great track star paul must feel proud of being coached by one of the best track stars paul could also relay to mr leonard because he knows how it felt not to be able to read out loud or he didnt know answers that everyone else knew
paul was surprised to fing out that mr leonard cant read he finds out they both has the same weaknesses paul realizes that if mr leonard can be a great hurdler than he can
the effect that paul gets when he gets the backround information on mr leonard was shcok and disbelief after confronting mr leonard about the information paul says why didnt you tell me about this the information showed that mt leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter dash and broke records but failed out for not being able to read
paul is really happy to be trained buy him but he dosent undersatnd why he stoped then after mrleonard tells him why he feels conected to him because he has the same problems paul then deciseds to help mrleornard the because he helped him
the effect that the background information has on paul is goodtrack and field is a great sport to be in it help you get good selfsteam and it strenghten your muscleif you get good grade and keep them then you can play in anyother sport you want to be in
that effects paul in a grater way then most becasue they both have an ajacent background paul couldnt read just like          mr leonard but paul has more help then mr leonard did so he wants to see paul take addvantage of that
it was a shocker to see 
it shows paul how important a good education is to someone because it ruened mr leonards career as a runner because he flunked out of college even though he was one of the best runners as a freshman
i feel paul was suprised that mr leonard was such a good athlete and didnt tell paul about it by paul saying why didnt you tell me about this paul is showing that he might be mad that mr leonard did not tell him
background information helps the reader understand who the character realy is paul learned that mr leonards background is sad and that paul does not see that as a setback paul then wants to jump hurdles to make mr leonard happy so background information is good because you understand the character more better
the readers gets background information about mrleonard is that he was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving along from one classroom to the netx but for paul it was a surprise in all tha they did it
mr leonards background information greatly influences paul in the story paul is faced by the obsticle of a being a slow reader when paul meets mr leonard and starts to train with him paul quickly discovers that mr leonard has broke records in college track paul is inspired by the fact that mr leonard a great athlete is training him what inspires paul even more is the fact that mr leonards also was a had a hard time with his reading by hearing about someone who has the same problems as him paul is inspired to work even harder at both his reading and his track
after paul hears mr leonards background story paul responds by asking for mr leonard to follow him back to the school paul feels the same way as mr leonard does about not being a good reader so as a result of mr leonard helping him with his confidence paul decides to return the favor and help mr leonard learn how to read
that mr leonard was just like paul when he was young
paul is a poor reader amd he finds out that so is mr leonard mr leonard flunked out of college and lost his track scholarship because he could not keep up with his grades this made paul feel better about himself because he isnt the only on with the problem it also shows that if you dont give up you can still suceed even with a few hurdles in the way he knows now how important it is to keep trying and that some obstacles in your life can be difficult to jump over
i think that the background information effect because now paul sees someone like himself paul can look up too him and make different disision then what mrleonard did by keeping good grades and so that he can also be a good athlete
mr leonard doesnt share important background information about himself until later in the story towards the end of the story mr leonard tells paul that he used to be a good athlete and that he wasnt very smart in school either this ppushes paul to start trying even harder in sports such as track
paul i surprised at the information he didnt know that he had been training with a track star and he was disapointed thet mr leonard hadnt told him about this before
he became more interested in mr leonards past in college after pauls findings that leonard broke records as a freshman in college he wanted to be just like him as successful as him as well so he continued to do the hurdles he also felt more of a connection with leonard when he found out he too had problems reading and had problems with words
paul finds out that mr leonard was also a track star and he is in amaze the track coach and paul had realized he was getting coached by someone great but paul also realized that him and mr leonard had a lot in common and it inspired him
the effect that this background story has on paul is that those words reminded him of himself and the emotions in mr leonards words we all too fmiliar to me he kne about the  feelings of embarrassment he felt obliged to help mr leonard since he had helped paul excel in something
paul knows how it feels to be rejected and embarrased and he wants to help mr leonard with his reading
the effect that the background information has on paul is that paul get curious  he wants to know more about mr leonard  he didnt understand why he didnt tell him about this before  that is why he went to him to talk about what he had found from the url the track coach gave him
paul learns that mr leonard flunked out of college he realizes that he needs to work hard in school his talent will not get him far in college he also realizes that mr leonard was helping him by getting him involved in other things
it has a pretty big effect on paul because he has the same problem so when mr leonard helps paul out with track it makes it where paul can try to help mr leonard out with reading
paul was amazed that mr leonards background information was that he broke college records his freshman year in the story states that paul took his free time to print out a paper about mr leonard  he then ask mr leonard why didnt you tell me about this
paul finds out like him mr leonard cannot read but can run track paul remembers what mr leonard had done for him by making him happy with doing track and decidesto teach him how to read because he understarnds the embarassment of not knowing how      the story states this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddently i realized what i could do for him this shows that paul wanted to thank him in some way and that way was teaching him to read
the effect this background information has on paul is he wonders why mr leonard never mentioned anything about it after he convinced him to run and jump over the hurdles
it suprised him at first but then later on he realized that mr leonard went through the same thing he is going through now he felt sympathetic for mr leonard because he couldnt read like him
the background information that paul recieves about mr leonard changes his views paul finds out that mr leonard has a reading disability paul is inspired by the information about mr loenard because he to has a reading disability paul says  the emotions on his face were all to familiar to me the reason that the emotions are familiar to paul is because paul feels those exact emotions almost every day
he feels empathetic for mr leonard because he knows what it feels like he is amazed that mr leonard was a college athelete he also wondered why mr leonard didnt tell him about it
the effect the background information had on paul was that mr leonard also had trouble with reading in the article it says no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
paul finds out that mr leonard cannot read either and now paul does not feel as bad for not being able to read he also finds out that mr leonard in college was a track star and that motivated him to do better
paul is amazed that the hall monitor at his school used to be a track star  when paul finds out his curiousity is sparked because paul wonders why mr leonard did not ever tell paul about his athletic past  paul questions mr leonard about college and discovers that mr leonard had the same reading problems paul has  this inspires paul to help mr leonard learn to read
the backgrounded information has an effect on paul because it relates to him and its kinda like him too 
he wondered why he would be a hall monitor when he was so good
the effect it had on paul was that the coach couldnt read either and he flunked out of college and he couldnt run track so he didnt want the same thing to happen to him because paul has a reading problem so hes got tutor
the back infomation reminds paul of him self
paul realizes that mr leonard broke high school records in field and track paul also figured out that mr leonard couldnt read since mr leonard had helped paul out with track paul figured he could help mr leonard learn how to read
when paul finds out about mr leonard im sure that he is encouraged to do well simply because now he knows hes being coached by a talented star in his day its motivation then when he finds out that he cant read as well i feel it motivates him even more because mr leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help paul not just has the training of mr leonard and the track team to help him with track but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read and he can be successful if he keeps at it
paul feels that mrleonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either paul could have helped mrleonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling the background information helped paul understand where mrleonard is coming from paul feels that they both come from the same problems he might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together
when the reader gets the background information about mr leonard he understands that mr leonard was in the same situation as him mr leonard was a good runner and he couldnt read very well just like the reader but the reader was getting help and mr leonard didnt want the reader to end up like he did flunking off because he couldnt read it would be a waste of potential
paul had almost the same background as mr leonard paul  was going threw probems like mr leonard did in school mr leonard told paul that he could do amything only if he tried
the background information that mr leonard told paul let him know that there may be challenges in life mr leonard didnt make the grades but he got into college just fine mr leonard wants to hep paul because he never got the oppurtunity to be in a learning center
he feels upset that mr leonard didnt tell paul about his past acheivements
the effect that has on the paul that mr leonard was a very good track runner in college paul didnt know mr leonard got put out of school because he didnt have grades mr leoard didnt wanna tell paul he got put out of school because of his grades paul found out that mr leonard cant read paul decdie to teach mr leonard how to read
after paul learns background information about mr leonard he realizes that they both have more in common than paul thought paul knows the emotions mr leonard went through like feelings of emarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew lines 4648 because of the fact that paul knows what mr leonard has gone through paul now realizes that mr leonard has given up his time to help paul and paul knows now that he can help mr leonard as well
i believe that it had a motivational effect on him i say that because he didnt want paul going through life feeling discouraged like mr leonard did he knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing another reason why i believe this had a movtivational effect on him was because he wanted paul to have confindent in himself and over the obstacle of not nbeing able to read
paul got background information about mr leonard from when he was a college student and was involved in hurdling paul was always chosen last for a basketball team so mr leonard to paul to the track to train him for hurdlers i believe mr leonard saw himself as paul in college mr leonard couldnt read and im sure he felt like an outsider therefore paul felt like an outsider when it came to being chosen last for a team everyday
paul finds out the mr leonard was a track star in his running days mr leonard tells him i was a good athlete but not a good enough student we had no learning centers in our schoolthis influenced paul to work harder at both track and reading he also wanted to assist mr leonard in reading
the information about mr leonard that paul finds is probably effected him in a way that he didnt understand why mr leonard wouldnt tell him that he used to be an amazing at hurdleing he probably felt confident know that someone else had been through what he was going through paul might have even felt greatful that someone had wanted to help him do something he thought he could never do
it encourages him to really work hard and make mr leonard proud and try to accomplish the things that mr leonard couldnt
when paul realised who mr leonard was he related his situation to his mr leonard and paul were in the same boat only mr leaonard was in college and flunked out when mr leonard asked him his name at the track paul thought it was weird only because he got stopped 2 times a week and he didnt remember his name so when all of the peices to the puzzle were put together he realised he didnt want to go down the path mr leonard had gone down
the background information given allows paul to connect to mr leonard both paul and mr leonard had reading disabilities in paragraph 6 paul tells mr leonard that he cant read and that is why he is going to the learning center later on in the story paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star in hurdles as well paul asks why mr leonard didnt tell him when he was coaching paul mr leonard then tells paul in paragraph 44 lines 45 that he flunked out of college because he couldnt read this connects paul and mr leonard paul then decides to help mr leonard with his reading
paul learns that mr leonard is not vary smart the narrator tells mr leonard that it is time for his training what means that paul is going to teach him to become better
the effect that the background information has on paul is it pushes him to stride forword and do better it also helps him realize that even thou you cant read you can still accomplish great things with mr leonard that great thing was breaking the 400 meter hurdles records at nationals
the background information we learn about mr leonard is a huge twist on the story by learning that mr leonard was a poor reader we know that he and paul have the same problem paul who we know cant read turns out to be a great athlete but cant read mr leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well mr leonard wants to help evolve paul into coming a better student athlete he cant rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college
when mr leonard told paul about his background that he flunked out of college paul was very understanding  paul was undergoing the exact same thing that mr leonard was paul couldnt read  paul knew how it must have felt for mr leonard to explain his past to paul  for example in paragraph 45 the narator paul says i knew them wellfeelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew  in that quote paul explains that he went through the same thing and feelings that mr leonard was going through when he told paul that he flunked out of college  paul understood clearly what mr leonard felt
when paul finds out about mr leonards past it makes him curious as well as determined knowing the man who was coaching him was a star athlete he also sees that education is just as important as sports and working hard will get you places just like mr leonard worked hard at sports it also gave paul motivation to be as successful as mr leonard but this time he could pass college while learning how to read
paul ggets excited to hear about his past but then begins to feel sad for mr leonard as he soon finds out about what happened to him in college by understanding that he needs to work harder than what he is doing right now to be outstanding
during the story paul gets background information about mr leonard when the high school track coach gives paul the url for a track and field website paul learns that mr leonard was a college track runnner who won nationals and broke records paul also learns that mr leonard lost his scholarship and flunked out of college
paul doesnt like on how they are getting a background check on mr leonard
the background information not only inspires paul to do his best for track and field but inspires him to motivate mr leonard he also learns that an education is a key part of being successful in the future he suggests that grabowski start his training once again and relive his dreams
the background information has a positive effect on paul because it reminds him of himself mr leonard couldnt read and neither can paul they both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them the background information brings paul closer to mr leonard and gives not only mr leonard to help paul but paul a chance to help mr leonard
i think it means just because you cant do one thing doesnt mean you cant achieve something else just as great paul wants to help mr grabowski like he helped him
when mr leonard was in high school he was just like paul he found it hard to read and felt discouraged and embarressed when called on in class to read aloud an exerpt paul has an advantage the remedial reading program paul goes twice a week and continues to learn to read mr leonard did not have this luxury and in time flunked out of college mr leonard sees himself in paul and strives to make paul an exceptional hurdler when paul discovers mr leonards past he feels a connection between them paul realized this man had given time to help him and he wanted to help mr leonard as well because paul knows of mr leonards past it has brought them a stronger friendship and it has probably inspired paul to become a great hurdler
he understands the mr leonard and paul werent so different because they both had trouble reading and didnt think they needed help
mr leonard feels that paul will not be able to get any where without being able to read
when paul get the background information fro mthe web site about mr leonard he was surprised but then made sense of it because mr leonard asked his name after seeing pauls hall pass for 2 weeks paul is also understanding because her knows how it is to be like mr leonard because he is in the same situation as mr leonard
mr leonard didnt do well in collegeevidence things were different back then he replied the college scouts told me that my grades didnt matter that id have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read

he is confused as to why as a freshman in a college a nationalist champion is a hall monitor at a high school he could have gone on to bigger and beter things he is also wondering why he would even bother with a kid who cant read and one day asked him to train with him he is also probably wondering why he didnt tell him about his past but as mr leonard tells him about his past he understands why he is doing this for him and why he cares so much

the affect that paul has on the background information about mrleonard is that when he told paul he lost his scholarship he had flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read that was what mrleonard had told paul also when he got stopped in the hallway mrleonard asked him where he was going and he looked at the pass but didnt know if paul was telling the truth paul found out at that point he didnt know how to read

the background information which paul discovers about mr leonard definately has an effect on pauls feelings for his new coach  unlike before paul now feels a connection with mr leonard in that they each have gone through similar struggles  by being able to relate to one anothers strengths and weaknesses their relationship will surely change in a positive manner

paul thinks he has done wrong in his life
during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard and it had a certain effect on paul mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals mr leonard had been teaching paul how to run and jump hurdles knowing his own background      paul might have been a bit suspicious at first due to mr leonard not telling him about his past however when going into detail about his past mr leonard exposed his embarassing secret he couldnt read so he flunked out of college      after this story of mr leonards life paul emphasized with him knowing that mr leonard had a problem reading and couldnt get help back when he was in school gave paul an idea cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school its time to start your training paul is going to help mr leonard after mr leonard helped him      they helped each other in this story because they seen a bit of themselves in the other mr leonard knew that paul couldnt read so he helped him learn how to jump hurdles knowing that could symbolize facing the problem head on and jumping over it passing  paul realizes that mr leonard couldnt read and so he helped him they bonded over their experiences
paul feels as if he and mr leonard are in the same boat they both have a hard time reading and are good at running hurdles paul wants to help mr leonard with reading while mr leonard helps him with running hurdles
paul was disappointed at first that mr leonard didnt tell him about his past hurdles experience however after talking with mr leonard he understands completely what he had went through and how hard it was for mr leonard to keep up in school paul knew all too well about that paul shows sympathy and understanding and decides to do something for mr leonard by helping him train with hurdles again it also instills motivation in paul to learn to read and do well in school so that he may one day go to college and do both hurdles and schoolwork
the background information wasa conection between the two because the both hav a harder time with school
the backround infomation tells paul that mr leonard is good at the sport and he wants him to succeed the backround infomation also tells paul that mr leomard needs help with something because he is shy about why he stopped track when paul found out that he could not read paul took him down to remedation
cause you should alwways do a background check
the background information paul got about mrleonard effects him when paul researched him he found out he won the 400 meter paul wanted to know what happened and mr leonard told him he got kicked  out of high school because he couldnt read and paul knows how that feels mrleonard wants paul to succeed an make it like he didnt
he realizes that mr leonard knows how he feels he was the same way it also shows him that he can do things just like hurdling you have to overcome them i also think that paul will continue to learn his reading and help mr leonard too
paul finds out from the track coach that mr leonard was once a national champion in college he then confronts mr leonard about it and gets the whole story mr leonard confesses that he was a bad student and ended up flunking out of college this helps paul realize that even though hes good at hurdles he needs to stay on top of his school work
the background information about mr leonard effected paul in many ways paul realized that mr leonard was a lot like him mr leonard could not read either when he was about his age and he looked at paul as himself and chose to not let the same thing happen to paul
it relates paul to mr leonard and he understands why he wanted to help him
when paul finds the background information about mr leonard he becomes more confident about his not being able to read and about running hurdles in track mr leonard explains how he was the best runner at his college and that he broke records but he could not read so he flunked out of college mr leonard felt sympathy for paul when he first stopped him in the hallway because they were in the same situation because they have this in common and because mr leonard helps paul paul wants to help him at his faults this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him paul helps out mr leonard by helping him learn how to read in exchange for mr leonard teaching paul how to run and jump hurdles
paul was shocked that mrleonard was a track star and was curious why he didnt tell him paul asked mrleanard why he didnt continue when mrleonard told him that his grades werent great then paul felt more motivated
it shows him what might happen if he does not try to push himself in his academics
he dident know about it he was shocked but he asked him about it
you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records that right there would automatically influence me paul may not have been a very good reader but he sure did want to make mr leonard proud so he joined the track team
at first paul did not really know why mr leonard was doing this and paul only did it because he was use to doing what mr leonard had told him then when mr leonard finally breaks down and tells paul what happened to him and all his story paul feels like he should bejust like mr leonard only difference is that paul will be able to read and do studies then paul will be able to get into college and actually get and education and do track at the same time      paul felt bad for mr leonard and ecided to be like him and do wehat he says because now that he knows that mr leonard was a track star and that he was really good means that paul will believe in mr leonard more and do everthing that he says even though he already listened to ehat he said usually it will just make him feel more comforting around him
paul is a little confused by the fact that mr leonard had never told him of his past and he had wondered why he had not told him  when mr leonard tells him why he had failed out of college and then paul returns the help mr leonard gave him by teaching him how to read
the effect the background information has on paul is that he feels more connected with mr leonard
he is surprised that he had not known how famous mr leonard had been and confused as to why he had not told him mr leonards story had a strong affect on paul because it was very similar to his
when paul discovered the background information it made him realize what a priveldge it was that he was able to be trained by him also it gave him confidence to go work out with the high school track team by knowing that the man who trained him broke national records he was given confidence pertaining to his own skills
the effect that it had was question the reson for that is he wondered why mr leonard didnt tell him about it
i think that all the background history that paul finds out about mrlenoard is a big change for him and that he needs to learn more about him to feel comfortable to play the sport that he is being trained in and that mrlenoard is feeling bad because he didnt let paul know ahead of time what type of background he had
he was very exited about finding out that he was being coached by somebody who all of these great things
paul goes to get help to learn how to readmr leonard tells paul that he cant read very well
paul has kind of the same thing going on in his life  after he finds out about mr leonards background he wants to help him
when he got the background information on paul he was shocked that he failed out of collage but he didnt want to say anything to harm him in anyway for failing  they both helped each other threw there hard times

it effects paul because paul has trouble reading and realizes that him and mr leonard have this in common he also may have realized that just because he is bad at reading doesnt mean he cant be good at other things

paul does research on leonard and finds out all that stuff about how he ran the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke all these records what it did was not only suprise him but it also inspired him because mr leonard couldnt read either so just because paul cant read doesnt mean he still cant succeed
the effect that the background information paul got from mr leonard shocked him it shocked him because paul would have thought that because mr loenard was a exellent track runner he would have went and graduated from college
he is puzzled he wants to know what happened to mr leonard after he broke the records he asked well what happened after that

the narrator started looking up to mr leonard because he was going through the same learning disablity he was fighting the narator noticed that mr leonard could not read very well when mr leonard asked his name when he checks his hall pass twice a week
after mr leonard told paul his story about college and his low skill on education paul realized that mr leonards words and speech were all too familiar to him paul knew how mrleonard felt about his feelings and embaressment when he had to read out loud
paul can really relate to mr leonard after he learns about his history and finds out that he could not read very well when he was a kid paul also is very impressed with the achievemnets that mr leonard achieved when he was in college pau realizes that he can help mr leonard by teaching him to read just like mr leonard taught paul to jump hurdlesi think that the similarity in each one of the characters pasts will help them to become closer together and form a good friendship with each other
pual is suprized that mr leonard was a kid is track also that he made it to calloge running track for them pual was also surprized he won the 400 as a freshman
paul feels sorry for him and wants to help  at the end of the story he starts walking back to the school to teach mr leonard how to read  paul could also relate to him since he had been bad at sports and mr leonard was bad at reading

this background information surprised paul he thought that mrleonard was just a hall monitor that kept students moving along to class when he found out about mrleonards past he felt sort of a connection with him in paragraph 45 paul said that he knew how mrleonard felt because he was going through the same thing
the backround information makes paul a better student because he asks for help with the learning center
it makes paul curious to why mr leonard never told him he use to be a hurdler since hes teaching paul to hurdle the after leonard tells him his story then paul relates to it and find they are alike
the effect that the background information has on paul is that paul could understand mr leonards point of view on things he went to the learning center as well as paul he told paul that he was a good athlete but had to work hard in high school to get good grades mr leonard felt emabarrassed telling paul but paul could tell the sadness because it was all too familiar to him paul wanted to help mr leonard just like mr leonard helped paul so thats just what he did
mr leonards story effects paul because paul is a poor reader himself and just found out that a teacher couldnt stay in college because he couldnt read either and realizes that without the learning center he could have ended up just like mr leonard it teaches him to be grateful for what he has
that he is not all that different form paul he wants him to learn how to read so he can excel in other things in life
the effect that the background information about mr leonard has on paul is that it encourages him to help mr leonard as mr leonard has helped him  paul relates to mr leonards embarassment with his reading difficulty and wishes to help mr leonard improve his reading as mr leonard has already helped him improve athletically
it reminds him how he has his problem with being an acedemic star but a terrible athlete because mr leonard was a star athelete but an academic failure he knows how that embarassing feeling feels being good at one thing but an embarassment to the other
when paul learns about mr leonards past hes wonders why he didnt tell anybody paul asks him what happened and then he feels more connected to him
after learning about the background information the coach told paul to look up i could imagine he was feeling mixed emotions at first when paul adresses leonard for the first time he is hesitant and confused because he wasnt sure why leonard would keep this from him however once leonard and paul talked about it briefly pauls emotions switched from confused to astounded by how leonard the hall monitor broke records in the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman
paul is excited knowing that mr leonard was a top athlete who did so many amazing things like braking records at a college level
it dosent have that much effect on him he is surprised that he had a past like his
he learned that mr leonard was really good at track and feild during high school he wanted to know why he stopped mr leonard didnt want to tell paul about it so he wouldnt give up i pulled the printout id downloaded the night before from my pocket why didnt you tell me about this 35 he wanted paul to do the best he could and not get worried about messing up
the background information that paul learns about mrleonard forces paul to see the concequences of not knowing how to read the background does this by explaining how my leonards inability to read made him flunk out of college which he then  lost his scholarship that he had for a sport he truly acceled at it also touches paul in a way that makes him see that pushing himself will always end up beneificial in the end
the effect the background infromation has on paul is that mr leonard had reading problems as a child and he turned to track and became very good at it and thinks that track could also help paul out a lot in life too
paul just thought mr leonard was a hall monitor but when paul found out about what mr leonard used to be and how mr leonard couldnt read just like paul and that made paul feel happy that mr leonard helped him excel at something and let him know its okay to not be able to read but keep working hard so you can stay in college
it teaches paul an important lesson that working hard in school is imortant it tells him that if you are not properly educated then you will be held back from doing what you want to do in the future when the coach tells the kid he flunked out of college this tells paul the importance of knowledge
paul knew how mr leonard felt he is the same way in school he felt embarrassed when he was asked to read or answer a question that he didnt know the answer to so paul felt like he should help mr leonard sience mr leonard helped him
i think it effected paul in a inspiring way when paul found out he look at mr leonard in a different way paul knew where mr leonard was coming from
paul was surprised because mr leonard did not tell him anything about himself for example the fact that leonard couldnt read
paul learns that mr leonard is similar to him in most ways he learns that the mr leonard cannot read just like him and that mr leonard was also an impressive athelete as paul is training for the track team he learns more about mr leonard he learns that mr leonard was a recordbreaking athlete on a college track team but that the record break didnt matter because he was a poor student paul could empathize because he too needs assistance with reading

it effects paul in a way that makes him feel that he was in the same situation as mr leonard they both cant read and they both are hurdlers paul is effected also in a way that makes him want mr leonard to be able to do the same things as him in the way that mr leonard wants paul to hurrdle paul wants mr leonard to be able to read
the information that paul gets is recieved in small bits and pieces  not until he researches mr leonard does he find out that he was a college track star who set records in college  finding out these things really helped paul in many diferent areas finding out that mr leonard couldnt read was a big part of that

paul didnt know anything about him at the begining and just thought that he was just a man in hallway when mr leonard took paul to the track that fist day he saw that mr leonard cared and that he wanted to help him he wondered way mr leonard asked his name that first day after seeing his pass for 2 weeks he found out that me leonards grade were bad and that he didnt make it through collage thats why mr leonard cared so much about paul getting his grades up and being involved in something
he is shocked that this hall monitor was once an exceptional track runner but like paul he cant read very well and school is a struggle for him it made paul feel like that maybe he can do this trac kthing and still be able to succeed at school some things just come easier for others while other people might have to work harder like for paul and school

paul is a poor reader and gets help from mr leonard
in the story when mr leonard told paul about his back ground he really didnt understandmr leonard was talking about how he was god at sports but not a good enough student and pual didnt understand because mr leonard had gone to college so in the end pual help mr leonard start trainging agian
paul may not think that mr leonard is a good enough athlete and a good coach
they got him to jump over a huedle
in this story mrleonard looks and see how he is going to be like he keep askingh stuff about him he also stay in the staiwell because he kniows taht paul leaves classes early eveyday because he knew thathe cant leave so he follow him and mad sure that he has help to read and he is a teacher that helps people with problems

whenever paul realized that mr leonard was a track star he probably started to feel as if mr leonard wanted him to be just as successful in track as he was but dismayed because he didnt know why he chose him once mr leonard revealed his secret of flunking out of college due to failure of reading which made school harder on him  paul felt a little more connected with him and it boosted his confidence
the background information given about mr leonard makes paul feel several emotions  he was excited to learn that mr leonard was an excelant hurdler who broke many records and got a college scholarship  he is also saddened and humbled that mr leonard flunked out of college  we no this from paragraph 45 where paul talks of how he relates to mr leonard and knows what it is like to no be able to read
paul thinks of that background information is not a big deal because paul is less woried about mr leonard than himself
paul can relate to mr leonard because both mr leonard and paul cannot read  paul knows what it is like to not know how to read  paul feels that mr leonard has helped him become good at a sport so paul is going to help mr leonard learn to read in paragraph 45 paul says suddenly i realized what i could do for him  this thought shows that paul is going to help mr leonard
paul is excited that mr leonard went to college he was happy that mr leonard was helping him paul wanted to know why he wanted to help his running and jumping he then found out later on that he went to college for track but then flunked out because of his bad grades paul then felt he needed to help mr leonard out like mr leonard did for him
the background information about mr leonard has a great effect on paul because he connects him to mrleonardby learning that mr leonard is unable to read just like himself paul feels a connection and feels like mr leonard gets him also by learning that mr leonard cant read paul feels he can relate to him and respect him more because mr leonard knows what it feels like fore paul when mr leonard talks about college and how he had to drop out because there were no tutors to help him paul then feels lucky that he has a placelearning center where he has someone to help him learn to read
paul printed out the papert about mr leonard and saw that he was a freshman in college who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals paul felt inspired but mr leonard feels bad because he flunked out of college
mr leonard was a track star but had trouble reading and had flucked out of college and lost his scolarship for track it affected paul because he too has trouble reading and has fallin in love with track it shows paul that if he doesnt buckle down and get on track with his reading he could lose something that actually means something to him
mr leonard was a trackstar  in college but had bad grades now he works as a janitor checking hall passes and helps paul with his reading and let him trained because of his past failures
the backround on mr leonard surprised pau because he never thought that a good athlete like mr leonard would be coaching when he could be racing perfeshinly after all those wins and records he made in college
the effect are that paul is shocked that mr leonard cant read
the background information that paul is presented with allows him to feel more personally connected with mr leonard paul feels connected to mr leonard because by both not knowing how to read they both knew about the embarrassing consequences that accompanied them whenever they were presented with a book magazine etc also paul feels the desire to be a good athelete like mr leonard and then ends up wanting to help him learn to read in return
the background information on mr leonard at the begining of the story tells the reader that mr leonerd is a strick guy whom everyone lision to
this man had given jis time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for himpaul wants to help mr leonard out because he help paul to be come better in something paul realized that you dont have to be perfect at everything
this background information gave paul a chance to figure out why mr leonard was helping him at the track it also gives paul a reason to trust mr leonard since he was an athelete that could not read as well
paul understands why mr leonard tells paul to keep up the good work at the learning center  because mr leonard was just like paul when he was a kid but back then they didnt really have the help paul has now in helping him read
paul is amazed that mr leonard was a star athlete but then when he asks about it mr leonard is sort of ashamed of himself  he uses his life lesson to pauls advantage because me helps him not make the same mistake in his life
it makes him want to try harder to succeed and work to be smarter so he dont fail
paul was surprised that he was working with a guy that broke records as a freshmen in collage pauls was showing him the pictures he got off the internet website that the track coach gave him paul then asked mr leonard what happend and mr leonard got kinda sad and his voice changed when he told paul he couldnt read eather so then paul said its time to start your training agian i think paul was happy to be coached by one of the best
paul realizes that mr leonard had the same problems in school that paul has in school paul sees that no matter how good youre at a sport you still need to have a good education if mr leonard had a good education than he wouldnt of been kicked out of college paul also sees that mr leonard helped him to overcome some of his fears and heartaches and so paul wants to help mr leonard in the same way he is going to teach mr leonard how to read
when mr leonard told paul that he was a poor reader and he was embarresed about it paul realized that he had felt the same way and that he had a lot in common with mr leonard and so he decided to help mr leonard on reading
paul discovers mr leonards past of being an amazing track and feild runner at college his freshman year and so he discovers that he didnt continue after that because he lost his scholarship due to the fact that he couldnt read mr leonards the hall monitor and sees paul go every time hes in english class to the learning center to learn how to read and he got the idea to teach him how to run track so he could get to know paul better the effect of this news causes paul after mr leonard explains what happened in college to help and take him to the learning center and learn how to read
when paul found out about mr leonard he became puzzled he then asked mr leonard about why he never told him about his past mr leonard wanted to help paul to succeed after hearing mr leonards story paul is as motivated as he has ever been to do well in school paul then wants to help mr leonard out by teaching him how to read
paul was shocked when he found out that mr leonard was a hurdler and he had broken national records but he also had sympathy for him after he found out that he couldnt read
the background information on mr leonard helps paul realize how similar they are he notices the feelings of embarrassment that mr leonard has towards his inability to read this then leads to him offering to help teach mr leonard to read just like mr leonard taught him how to do well in track
when paul discovers the background information on mr leonard and how he too had trouble reading and flunked out of college paul is prompted to overcome his challenges and not end up like that he also is even motivated to help mr leonard with his own reading problems
paul has feelings of understanding he has gone through the same things the mr leonard has gone through it is sensed that there is an eagerness in paul he has an eagerness to learn from mr leonard both athletically and in how to handle situations that present themselves in life paul also shows a willingness to teach even though he himself cannot read he still is trying to urge mr leonard to learn to read with him
the background information paul finds out about mr leonard help support him to do the best he canits time to start your training
once paul had checked out the website mr leonard told him about he was curious to why he didnt tell him that he was a college track star since paul came back the next day knowing that information about mr leonard it was obvious to mr leonard that paul learned how to read     this also makes there relationship better because they both had similar problems that they overcame paul joined the track team and at the very end paul offered mr leonard a reading lesson
it motivates him to work harder in school  he wants to succeed at track but to do that he needs to succeed academically as well  it allows him to empathize with mr leonard  they both have experienced embarassment on account of their reading disability this causes paul not only to want to do better in school and track but also to help mr leonard overcome his reading disability just like he helped paul overcome his lack of athletic skill
when mr leonard says i lost my scholarship and flunked out it says paul feels like mr leonards words were all to familiar to me paul then connected with him because mr leonard is going through the same ordeal as paul then starts their friendship
the background information on mr leonard makes paul want to help him on his reading skills mr loenard helped paul so paul decides to help him in return
paul finds out that mr leonard was an amazing track star and was an awful reader like himself paul also found out that mr leonard flunked out of college because the track team didnt want someone who could not read this discourages paul because this is a very similar situation that he could go through in a way paul feels comfortable because he knows that hes not alone in this because he has mr leonard by his side
he was shocked that he had a college all star in track teaching him and he also didnt understand why he hadnt said anything about it wonce he finds out what he happended to him he wants to help and said its time to start his trianing by teaching him to read
it has a conetion with how paul is now in high school
he completely understands how he feels he said he knew what it was like when he felt embarrassed when he was called upon to real aloud or when he did not know an answer everyone else knew mr leonard trained with him and made him better at hurdling he soon realized he could teach mr leonard how to read so he started his training
the effect that the background reading has on paul is empathy paul knows how mr leonard feels because paul has problems reading too paul shows this empathy when he says the emotions of mr leonards words were all too familiar to me feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud the information shows paul that hes not alone and that he can make a difference on mr leonard by helping him to learn how to read like mr leonard had taught him how to hurdle
paul is subjected to training from mr leonard after school on track and field this opens up questions as to why mr leonard is a janitor when he clearly knows alot about track and field these questions open up more ideas as to why mr leonard would help paul when paul discovers the truth to mr leonards background he is astonished that he was trained by someone that was top notch in track and field
mr leonard was a track star but he could not keep up in school  he flunked out of college because he could not read paul realizes he needs to be able to read to be sucsesful
the information about mr leonards background encourages paul at first paul doesnt understand why mr leonard didnt tell him in the first place but then he realizes that mr leonard is only trying to help him avoid the mistakes that he made mr leonard is pleased by pauls efforts to improve his reading because it could prevent him from losing the opportunities that mr leonard did
i think that the information paul has found about mr leonard effected him in different ways i do beilieve that paul was shocked to have found out that grabowski had set many records in hurdles but i also think he had to have known mr leonard knew what he was doing i think that paul was very sympathtic and understanding when he found out leaonard could not read the effect it had on paul most likely gave him hope toward himself the fact that paul is offering to teach mr leonard to read at the end of the story shows that mr leonard had effected him in a positive way
in this story the main character paul cant read mr leonard stopped him in the hallway almost every day when paul was on his way to the learning center mr leonard would just glance at his pass and let him go eventually when mr leonard decides to start training paul on the hurtles paul starts getting really good at hurtles and running paul was talking with the high school track coach and the coach told him to look at the track and field website when paul found mr leonard as one of the past athletes he was shocked mr leonard told paul that he was once in college but he had to drop out because he could not read      i think that since paul cannot read this information about mr leonard is very inspiring to him in a sense paul realizes he can make it to college but he needs to keep trying unlike mr leonard paul has a lot in common with mr leonard and i think that is inspiring
the background information on mr leonard makes paul want to help mr leonard succeed at reading like mr leonard helped him suceed at hurtles
the background information on mr leonard has an inspirational effect on paul  this is shown in paragraph fortyfive when paul relates his situation of not being able to read well to mr leonards situation  mr leonard noticed that and decided to help paul become a good athlete  so paul returned the favor and is going to help mr leonard with his reading
it helps paul understand why mr leonard helped him with the training more it also gives paul an idea on how to help mr leonard as a payback
it kinda made him disappointed becuase mr leonard never told him anything abou thow good of an athlete he was mr leonard also never told him that he couldt read either
that he was a track star in collige
it helped because its information and any information normally helps or clears things up
the background information just makes paul want to make mrleonard a better person he paul felt as if he should be able to help him out since mrleonard helped him out by making him a better runner so he feels inspired to help him learn work on how to read
the information tells you that paul and mrleonard are alike they are both poor students who is not the good of readers that why mr leonard ask paul to do the hurdles he and paul are alike if they do something they work there hardest they will achieve anything
paul learns that mr leonard struggled with reading when he was a young boy mr leonard went to college and was an amazing runner and all through school he was told that his grades did not matter that he would have tutors to help him one day he realized that college was harder than high school he lost his scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who could not read paul realized that mr leonards word were all too familiar he new the feeling of not being able to read he knew that learning to read was very important
it inspires him to help mrleonard with his reading just as mrleonard has helped him with track and field he feels inspired so since mr leonard has helped him he thought it would be nice to give mrleonard some help too
the effect of learning about mr leonards background is that he gains the knowledge that even the most seemingly successful people can suffer from similar struggles to him and that even the people he respects can use help from others
the background infromation that paul learns about mr leonard effects him by showing him others go through the same thing and that hes not alone pqul also feels the same emotion of embarassment as mr leonard did and he then realized he could help him out to
the effect that this background information of mr leonard has on paul is somewhat overwhelming for paul  he probably cannot believe he has been working out with such an outstanding star and athlete  when paul finds out why mr leonard loses his scholarship he feels bad for him  this only encourages paul more though  he realizes that mr leonard did not have the programs that kids today do and with mr leonard showing how much he cares about him  paul will be taking full advantage of those programs to learn to read better and become a much better student
the information paul learns about mr leonard affects him because he can relate to his story very easily because they both cant read it also motivates paul to help mr leonard learn how to read
mrleonard tells paul that he used to jump over the hurdels in college and paul has enough confidents that he could do it to
the background information that paul finds on the website given to him causes him to have a common ground with mr leaonard since mr leonard stuggled with reading as well and did extrememly well in track
at first paul is excited to learn he has been training with a track star then he realizes that mrleonard has given him a gift of track and when paul learns that mr leonard cant read paul gives him the gift of reading
it lets paul know that he isnt the only one who has problems reading mr leonard said that he wasnt a good student and that is why he lost his scholarship and flunked out paul said that he knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called up on and didnt know the answer or told to read aloud
paul is effected by the discovery because he has the same problem that the janitor has paul understands how the janitor feels and wants to know more about the janitors life in college and why he is not still running today
the effect of finding out the background of mr leonard on paul is that he wants to help him learn how to read like mr leonard helped him how to jump hurdles better
the background information he gets bothers him because he doesnt know if he can add up to all of it ti impress him
paul was surprised that mr leonard was such a great athlete when mr leonard told him i was a great athlete but not a good student paul knew what mr leonard was doing paul understaood that mr leonard was in the same situation as him and he wanted to help him as much as he could try and get paul to understand that he can build his confidence to be a good student and be the good athlete also
the background information had a great effect on paul in the story because paul learning that mr leonard couldnt read just like paul it motivated him to try harder to excel at running hurdles as well as school work this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him this quote proves my point that after learning background information on mr leonard paul was ready to get better at track and school
he listens more to what mr leornard has to say also in paragraphs thirtythree down to fourtyfive paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star but flunked out of college this fact got paul to work harder at hurdles and help mr leonard
after learning the background information of mr leonard the effect it has on paul changes his views paul learns mr leonard was a great athlete that even broke records his freshman year of college when paul learns mr leonard flunked out he cant imagine why mr leonard wants paul to know that an athletic career might get him a scholarship but wont save him embaressment if he doesnt know how to read after paul learns mr leonard is still embaressed that he cant read paul wants to repay mr leonard with the same confidence he gave to paul paul takes the initiative to in turn train mr leonard in reading as mr leonard has trained paul to have confidence in both reading and life
paul probably felt special when he found out that mr leonard has broken national records in hurdling and wanted to train him  he must have felt like mr leonard cared about him
paul feels that he can relate to mr leonard because they both share the same problem this is evident when paul says the emotions in mr leonards voice were all too familiar to me after mr leonard explains his troubles with reading
they both had something in common they both couldnt read and they wanted to do sports the only reason the teacher wanted to help the kid was because he wanted to play in a sport when he was young but he couldnt because he couldnt read
he wants to be good at track
he has more respect for the lessons leonard is teaching him because he finds out leonard was a track star so he probably knows what he is doing
in the story paul gets information on the mr leonard and this effects paul in good way because this is an insperation to paul to go after what he wants
the background information about mr leonard has a great effect on paul  he has many emotions going through his head because he realizes that he is a younger version of mr leonard  he thinks about how he knows the feelings mr leonard felt  since mr leonard helps him so much on hurdles he is going to help him read  the fact that mr leonard had never gotten the remediation that paul was getting in school now makes paul even more motivated
paul understands that mr leonard is trying to help paul acheieve in something else mr leonard was at the time where he didnt have what paul has mr leonard relied on friends to help him get by paul works harder now becuase collage scouts told mr leonard that grades didnt matter but the real truth was that they did mr leonard flunked out because collages didnt want a runner that couldnt read
learning about mr leonards past made paul understand that someone understood how he felt in lines 4547 paul says that he and mr leonard both feel the same way about their reading issues he also realized that he could return mr leonards generosity and in line 46 implies that he will do this by teaching mr leonard how to read  paul became more motivated by mr leonards story both about running the hurdles and learning to read
paul wonders what happened to mr leonard that would have him ending up being a janitor and when he finds out mr leonard flunked out of college it helps him remember that he needs to learn how to read well the narrator doesnt want to feel embarrassed anymore and seeing mr leonard and finding out about his past makes it feel even more crucia for him to learn to read so he can better himself in life because only he can decide his future and it helps him realize that now that he has the tools to suceed he should help mr leonard out too
the background information has an empathetic effect on paul he realises that mr leonard has had a hard life and that he didnt get to do what he wanted to do paul starts to feel the need to help mr leonard back by helping him to learn to read
the information helps paul realize what he can achieve if he works hard mr leonard was and excellent athlete but not a good student so he was given a scholorship for track and field even though he did not recieve good grades he later flunked out of college because he did not earn good grades by not worrying about them he wants paul to work hard and learn how to read so he does not have to go through what he did it shows paul how to get over obstacles
that paul is geting helped in the spots he want to get better at and mr leonard is geting helped in his reading
it shows that even some of the most talented kids have problems in show area of their life in the story mr leonard can not read which showed paul that everyone has problems
paul feels sorry for mr leonard he felt he had to do something to thank mr leonard for helping him be good at something
the information that paul gets tells him that mr leonard is just like him
when paul finds out that mr leonard was a record breaking college hurdler he is surprised  this makes him wonder why he is pushing him to be an athlete which he finds out is because paul and mr leonard are almost the same person but at different points in their lives
paul is difrrent from them becaus he thinks that hes better then the other people and that he only knows how to do things his way and thats how its going to be he also thinks that he can do anything in life whitch is not like that you have to learn from it and then experice what you been throught after alking about it he acts more like a kid trying to remmember that happen during his child hood back then and trying to interact with other people acepting him because of who ihe is not because of how he look aae
when paul finds out mr leonard was an old track star he wanted to know why he didnt tell him then he asked why he stopped mr leonard was embrassed to say that he had got kicked out of college because he couldnt read and his grades werent there  paul knew what it felt like to not be able to read since mr leonard was there to help him become better paul said  its time to start your training saying that he was going to teach him to read
before paul went up to mr leonard the effect of the information on paul is that maybe he could be as good as him the effect on paul after comfronting mr leonard was that since mr leonard was teaching paul what he knows about hurdling paul could teach mr leonard what he knows about reading
when paul researched mr leonard he was shocked that mr leonard didnt share his past with him paul didnt understand why mr leonard would keep his track achievements a secret paul was shocked and confused paul said you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals you broke records  mr leonard replied i remeber best race of my life then paul asked himwhat had happened
paul gets what he wants to do by mr leonard because he want to be just like him so he strted in track which the teacher was mr leonard
it made paul curious of why mr leonard didnt still run track
after hearing the success and the downfall of mrleonard paul realizes that he has to keep hisself motivated so he can reach success paul took mrleonards story to heart you can imply this due to pauls last sentence of the text cmon mr leonard its time to start your training i believe that paul was going to help mrleonard on his reading skills becuase he helped him on his track skills
just as paul is finding all of the background information on mr leonard he is beginning to realize that he too can agree and relate to him because they both have that in common where reading and speaking aloud in the classroom is and always has been a struggle for them they have both looked for help in the learning center so they could finally become a better reader and be better at something in school the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew  paul knew the feeling he shared the exact same struggle with mr leonard
it shows paul that he needs to overcome is difficulties  he sees that mr leonard could have had a much better life if he had been able to keep up with the work as well as the running  paul realizes that he should help mr leonard with his difficulties
paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star in his college days he wonders why mr leonard quit running track if he was so good at it paul confronts mr leonard and finds out that he had flunked out of college because he never learned how to read we find out in the beginning of the story that paul goes to the learning center twice a day to learn how to read paul finds out through this experience that grades are important when it comes to college you may be good at sports but if you dont know how to read you wont be able to play sports because you may flunk out of college paul realizes that he is lucky to have found a companion like mr leonard to teach him a very valuable lesson about life
paul most likely feels like he can relate more to mr leonard he knows that they both have a difficult time reading he feels like there is a kind of connection beween the two of them he knows that they both struggled with the same thing and he figures if mr leonard can help him gain confidence and be good at something he can help him learn how to read
the background information that paul got motivated him to put mr leonard through training to teach him how to read because mr leonard helped him to become a track runner he knows the embarrassing feelings that mr leonard must have felt and now wants to help him overcome his problems
it show very little about the brackground for paule 
the background information that paul learns about mr leonard effects him because mr leonard helped him overcome his differances so he wants to help mr leonard with his together they make a good team
the effect it has on paul is kind of shocking to him when paul gets the background about mr leonard he was appauled he was shocked that he seen that mr leonard has all the records for the hurdles but when paul was talking to mr leonard he had no idea that he had dropped out of college and stopped playing sports because of his grades so the effect that it had on paul is that he knew that mr leonard knew what kind of struggles he was having and thats all that mr leonard wanted to do was to help him through it
we learn through this passage that paul cant read and that he recieves help for it when mr leonard was a student he didnt try to get help for not being able to read and in the end he flunked out of a college and is now a hall monitor mr leonard is trying to tell paul that if he doesnt start to learn how to read no matter how good he is at something college wont take him he is also trying to show him how important reading can be
mr leonard also had problems with reading in school as it mentions that he could not read in college  this gives mr leonard and paul something in common  ultimately it is an encouragement for paul to continue on with school and track
the effect it has on paul is he gets confused and then encouraged because he can train mr leonard
mr leonard reveals how he was an amazing runner in high school but he wasnt a good student he found school hard and flunked out of college mr leonard saw himself in the narrator and thats why he helped him so that the narrator could have a better more successful future with college jobs and sports what he didnt have
paul is shocked that mr leonard cant read and trys to help him mr leonard dosent want anyone to know that he cant read so he hides it
mr leonard couldnt read just like paul couldnt read mr leonard felt embarrassed telling paul he wasnt a good student and he couldnt read whenhe was in college and mr leonard still cant read
the background information effects paul in a good way the background information shows paul that he needs to do good in school stay in track it also shows paul that mr leonard was a great track star and i think that would affect paul positively
when paul discovered the background information about mr leonard he was suspicious to why he was never told about his achievements in track and field  paul also wondered how he could have been so good yet ended up as a hall monitor  this caused paul to confront mr leonard about it
paul is intrigued and asks mr leonard what happened in paragraph 40  mr leonards story inspired paul a lot because he too struggled with academics as well as reading
paul realizes that the man is trying to help him the man used his own time to help paul to get better at something
he believes that if mr leonard was a poor reader but could excel at track he could too he feels like he and mr leonard have a lot in common and begins to feel a connection with him
it makes him want to show him that he can do his best and show how much he has help him
the effect of the background information paul gets from the url the high school track coach gives him is fairly great knowing that mrleonard was a poor student and couldnt read just like paul is now brought them closer together this is strongly supported in the last two sentences
once paul realized that mr leonard suffered the same difficulties with literacy that he himself struggles with paul has a new sympathy for mr leonard paul appreciative of the effort mr leonard is putting into helping him overcome his troubles decides to help mr leonard learn to do what troubled him in his college years their shared difficulty with learning to read gives them a similar perspective and allows each to sympathize and assist in any way they can
paul is suprised that mr leonard was an incredible athlete but a terrible student the information caused paul to feel empathy toward mr leonard because paul is in the same situsation that mr leonard had been when he was a student  mr leonard is trying to help paul become a better athlete and a better student by motivating him on the track field and it works because of pauls empathy towards mr leonard he is inspired to aide mr leonard in his reading studies
it gives paul respect for the man who went through the same experience paul is going through now  he felt mr leonards emotions were familiar  he knew that mr leonard started training him to make paul feel better about himself just as he had so many years ago  paul felt he should return the favor and is going to teach mr leonard how to read
paul kind of looked up to mr leonard so the imformation that he recived he was angry shock and unpleased
the information he egt inspires him to teach mr leonard to read just as he tought him to do hurdles
in the story when paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a track star and won many metals he was shocked and when he learned that he had to stop track because he could not read it made paul feel more couraged to read and be a track star
i think that the background information that paul found about mr leonard had a suprising effect on him he was questioning how mr leonard did not know his name when he checked his hall pass twice a week
the effect that the backgroud information has on paul is that its going to help him to succed in his career in the future when he foud out that mrleonard was a college freshman athlete that raced in the 400 metter hurdles and he won nationals he was surpriced that mrleonard  had accomplished thatbut paul asked why he had stoped his career in track and mrleonard told him he was really good at track but he had a hard time learning and reading that they had give him the wrong advice paul is compared to mrleonadr in the way that both of them have a hard time learning but they are really good in the same sport mrleonar dis helping paul realize to study ahrd and he would accmplish many things in life like how he learned how to jump hurdlesit was going to be the same with school is like a hurdle you have to practice to accomplish thing in life
in the story paul gradually gathers information about mr leonard at fisrst this information makes paul suspicious of mr leonard  he asks mr leonard why he didnt tell him  when mr leonard explains his reasons paul is understanding and decides to help mr leonard  this background information makes paul realize what he can do to help mr leonard
the information that has on paul is what the story is telling us
according to the story the background about mr leonard effects paul in a very positive way paul sees how good mr leonard could have been at track so that motivates him to keep working hard in school and in track in the story when paul says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me that shows the readers what mr leonard means to paul mr leonards was a lot like paul when he was a boy and that has an effect on paul paul now wants to strive forward and be the best he can be
the effect of the background information is to help the readers understand more about what he went through in life
the reader finds out that mr leonard was a bad student so he had to quit what he loved most
he thinks about it and it reminds him about himself and what he had been going through so at the end he takes mr leonard and says its time to start your training
paul is like mr leonard they both struggle with school work but are good at other things paul didnt realize until after he had already been training with mr leonard for quite some time then he felt even closer and somewhat connected with him
it helped he to try and succed at what he was doing made him want to show the others that he could do something more
when he was told that mr leonard had been a college track star i think that made him open his eyes a little wider and relize who he was working with after he went to that url  you were a college freshemen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records when he saw that then he relized that he wasnt jsut working with a hall monitor he was working with a star
the background information effected paul by showing him you can be anything paul thought mr leonard was just another janitor but he wasnt in the story paul shows excitement when he talked about mr leonard breaking records and winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals paul had the effect of someone he could look up to and learn from when mr leonard told paul he couldnt read paul told him it was his turn to train paul was happy to have a coach who did something great in his past paul realized you cant ever judge a book by its cover because you never know whats in the pages
paul was suprised to know that he had been training with a college track star that broke records on a national level the reader can tell he was shocked when the narrator say you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records then the narrator asks him what had happend and was suprised to find out that mr leonard had the same problem that paul had
paul wonders why mr leonard never told him about this and paul finds himself relating to his story because paul is not a good reader and neither is mr leonard this story about mr leonard doesnt really discourage paul but he finds himself wanting to help mr leonard the same way he helped him
paul did not know that mr leonard was a track star in collage then he found out that mr lleonard failed out because he could not understand the classes mr leonard could see him self in paul he knew that he could do good in track
it encourages him then he wants to help mr leonard learn to read
the narrarator received background information from the track coach about mr leonard grabowski  mr grabowski was a record breaking hurdles runner back in the day but at college his grades were so poor that he lost his scholarship and flunked out  due to his disability to read properly he had lost it all       when the narrarator asked mr grabowski about his past the narrarator saw similar emotions to what he was going through when he got embarrased as he struggled at reading aloud or when he didnt know the answer that everyone else in his class knew  the narrartor completely understood why mr leonard was embarrased by his past
it confuses paul because mr leonard was so good at track he didnt know why he stopped running  paul askes mr leonard why he stopped running
he learns about him breaking records in college and being amazing at track this changes his view on mr leonard i think this makes him respect him more when he finds out about his reading struggle this allows him to relate with mr leonard
the background information that paul gets on mrleonard helps encourage paul to keep going and to learn and to teach mrleonard how to read mrleonard said i was a good athlete but not a good student paul said at the evnd cmon mr leonared its time to start your trainging
paul relates to mr leonards story because paul couldnt read either in paragraph 6 paul states that he goes to the learning center because he cant read and in paragraph 44 mr leonard states that he was an exceptional athlete that could not read also hearing this story has changed paul because he wants to be able to give back to mr leonard what the hall monitor gave to him he does this by telling mr leonard to come with him to start his training in reading paragraph 46

the background information that paul learns gives him sympathy for mr leonard and gives him the courage to do a friendly thing for mr leonard by helping him with his struggles
it doesnt reallt have an effect on pau paul just asked about his past and why mrleonard did not tell him about it
i think it helps paul out more knowing that someone like mr leonard was a very good athete and then taught paul everything          plus i think it made paul apriciate leonard more then just a hall monitor that helped him out 
the effect of the backround information on paul is that it shows him how important it is to work hard it also shows him that he shouldnt be embarassed about his reading problem because he is not the only one
it effects him because he is the same as mr leonard in the sense of not being able to readit also effects because he knows how the embarrasment feels of not being able to read and the fact the mr leonard has given his to help hime eexcel at something
paul gets background about mr leonard past mr loenard told paul about how he co
at first paul seemed to be disappointed because mr leonard hid it from him but he was thinking in his mind that he knew where he was coming from the embarrassment and the teasing from other students he realized that mr leonard helped him excel in something and so the least he could do was give him something in return
paul found something in commen with mr leonard and that is their problem with reading paul knew mr leonard since middle school who does his job very well it makes paul more active and found the imporatance of life mr leonard helped him to pass the obstacles that stopping him to do something he waant to do
the background information about mr leonard was shocking to paul paul was shocked to see that mr leonard was a track star in college paul found out later that mr leonard flucked out of college because he could not do the work because of the lack of help he got in high school paul now wants to do the best that he can in school so he can be a track star and also do extremly well in school
paul finds out about mrleonard and it makes him want to try because if he has someone that is that talented help him it will motivate him to do good paul trys hard because he wants to show mrleonard that he can do it and that he dont want to get picked last any more when he is playing a sport mr leonard explains to paul that you dont just get picked because you are good at a sport you have to know how to read and do math and things like that thats why paul needs to do good in school and not just sports when mr leonard was in collage he could not go to a learning center because they didnt not have one back then     mrleonard told paul to take advatige of the learning center and get the help cause he needs it
the information that paul finds out about mr leonard shocks him because he never told paul about his past and why he was so willing to help him become better at something he liked mr leonard was very helpful to paul but it never occured to paul that he was never asked his name until he met him after school at the track because he checked his hall pass twice a week
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone esle knew
it has an effect on paul because mr leonard cant read like paul they both are good runners and can do herdles and they both never learned how to read so the were alike
the effect on paul from finding some background information is that paul is shocked to find out that mr leonard won the 400 hurdles in sectionals and that mr leonard also broke records mr leonard was struggling accademicly so once he flunked out no other collage wanted a athalete that could not read
the background information tells him that mr leonard was a really good sports player and that he had made records mr leonard didnt want to tell paul about it because he has had the same experience that paul had paul told him you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records what happened after that said paul mr leonard said i was a good athelete but not a good student we had no learning centers in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard mr leonard doesnt want paul thinking he cant acheive something just because he didnt he wants him to try real hard which is why he decided to help him out
my thoughts about the background information may differ on one hand i think paul may try to work hard on grades and excel on track but also at the same time he may question himself about what if this happens to me and give up on lreaning how to read better
the effact it had on paul was great it made paul relate more to leonard and encouraged him to do better when he learns that leonard can not read he is encouraged to help his newly found friend out to teach him to read just as leonard help him find something the paul could excell at
the backround information about mrleonard says that he was just concernd about paul and who els ever joined the hurdles  mr leonard wanted to look out for the students who was on the track and field
paul learns by reading about mr leonard on the website that he was a great hurdler that broke national records so he wants to know why mr leonard never mentioned it when he tells him why paul realizes that he is just like him and sees that even though you cant read you can still succeed
it makes paul want to be good in a sport he wants to have the fame and glory he wants mr leonard to teach him how to scuceed in the sport and make him as good as he was
during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard that effects the background information on paul because paul now knows that mr leonard went through the same phrase as him
the background information that mr leonard tells to paul impacts pauls life mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and broke records even though mr leonard was a good athlete he did not get good enough grades to pursue his scholarship and he flunekd out all the words mr lenoard told paul were very familiar to him
the information that paul found out about was suprising because he didnt know anything about mr leonard being good in track he found it hard to believe he flunked college
the information that mr lenonard gives him about college scares him he doesnt want to fail out of college like they other guy did he wants to make it in life and make sure that he is successful in all the things to come before him
the background information that paul learns about mr leonard  affects the way he sees sports and education when the narrator says suddenly i realized what i could do for him he learns that they could both help each other excel in education and sports
it made paul feel like he wasnt alone or by himself after all in paragraph 45 paul describes how it effects him he says mrleonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew he felt bonded with mrleonard
this new information changes his whole view of mr leonard he now realizes that mr leonard is like him paul in that he has trouble with being able to read as well
the background information has inspired paul to learn how to read and do his best in school
when paul gets backround information on mr leonard he is empathetic because he cant read either paul also said i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew  this statement shows how he is empathetic after this though he becomes strived to achieve in training for hurtles
the effect that the background information gave on paul is that he should try to do the things that you think that you cant do if you have the right help and support you can do anything he shouldnt give up just because he cant do things other kids can you can do anything if you just try
the backround information that paul gets about mrleonard is about how he was a runner for his collage and he flunked out he also lost his scholarship and he couldnt read and they didnt want a runner that couldnt read however the collage scouts told him his grades didnt matter he just wanted paul to understand thats school is very inportant
the effect of the background information on paul was supriseing because he didnt know that mrleonard was a allstar athlete and even in school he had reading problems mrleonard wanted to show paul that he could over come his problems of not being able to read
he goes to the website the track coach gives him to pauls disbelief he finds out that mr leonard was once a track star paul couldnt believe what he had found out he was astonished to see that mr leonard had won national races and broke records he confronted mr leonard about all of it he found out that mr leonard also had issues reading and flunked out of college because of it
the information really changes the view of mr leonard in that at first from the aritcle he read he felt more admiring of him later when mr leonard tells him that he cant read he is smpathetic and more close to him because mr leonard is like him
the training that helped paul couldnt read either so when paul figured this infomation out he knew how his trainer felt
the background information about mr leonard gave paul so inspiration because since he had found out that mr leonard hadnt been so good in school paul was going to help him since mr leonard was teaching him track
paul sees that he is being coached by a great athlete who had many successes that had to have made paul feel that he was going to get better because his coach  had experience
mr leonard embodies the once great old mentor cliche because paul is unaware of mr leonards past and is used to following his orders paul is willing to try the things mr leonard confronts him with as stated in paragraph one the last sentence everyone complied no one questioned mr leonard and therefore his past was never questioned     when mr leonard becomes empathetic towards paul it changes things when you become used to someone it becomes easier to question and learn about them paragraph eight foreshadows this relationship when it says the mr leonards gaze softened towards paul     not knowing about mr leonard really has as much effect in the early stages of their acquaintance as much as later learning changes their relationship when the coach writes out a web address and tells paul visit this site do a search for grabowski it precludes the notion that mr leonards life was dull and without bother for question rather it changes the accepted lack of knowledge to a pursuit of mystery     finally when paul learns of the reading impairment that he shares with the old janitor the relationship is solidified because they have a common ground once the existance of this common ground is justified that is once paul realizes that there is a common place between them leonard grabowski becomes a much less abstract and more relateable figure     for that reason the discovery of mr leonards past effects paul and the background information that was previously missing completes the puzzle and lays the groundwork for a more realistic and compelling relationship between mentor and student
once paul realizes that mr leonard has the same reading problem as him paul wants to help him just like mr leonard helped paul paul knows where mr leonard is coming from by the emotion in mr leonards vocie the feelings of embarrassment and not being excepted because no schools wanted a track runner who couldnt read so paul understanding mr leonards situations wants to help him train to be a good reader just like paul was trained to be a good track runner
mr leanord was a track runner who was bad at schoolit says so in the story
the new information motivates paul to do well and even to help mr leonard learn how to read
paul is shocked that mr leonard was a highschool tack star paul wants to train with him even more now
after knowing the background about mr leonard paul seemed to admire him when paul first found out about all the records mr leonard had broke he was amazed and shocked at the same time paul also felt sad for mr leonard since he could not read paul wanted a way to help mr leaonard since he had helped him so he told him it was time for him to learn
the effect this has on paul is a postive effect he sees that mr leonard was very successful in something and he helped him become successful in it as well without telling him about his achievments paul asks mr lenord why he never shared this information with him this being a touchy subject when paul sees that mr leonard actually lost his scholarship due to grades it showed the importance of a good education
the background information helps paul understand that mrleonard was in the same situation that he is in high school mrleonard couldnt read but he was good as an athlete just as paul is paul decides to help mrleonard learn to read
paul doesnt understand why mr leonard flunked out of college because he thought that you had to be smart to there he was also curious because if he couldnt get through high school on his own how did he expect to make it through college
the background of mrleonard is very similiar to pauls when you find out that mrleonard can not read just like paul but mrleonard did not have the resources that paul does in the end after mrleonard helps paul succeed at track paul uses his resources to help mrleonard
he learned the coach couldnt read ans he was good at track
i think the backgorund information has a big impact on paul one reason i think this is because since paul found out more about mr leonard it really encouraged him to go for what he wanted and not let anything stand in his way even if paul would ever fail on something he would have mr leonard right there telling him to get right back up and try again
paul realizes why mr leonard has been helping him and helps him to understand better what his reasons were
being known as the hall monitor without a secondary or primary source for paul there would have been no possible way for him to have known mr leonard as a hurdler its easier to see him as an everyday average person as he seems than a famous record breaking champion in his youth with the average job he has
its encouraging to know about his tutor
the information makes paul curious as to why mr leonard hadnt told him that information the next day pual asked mr leonard about the paper he had printed off mr leonard tells him about it
that he gets into trouble and that he gets talked to about it
learning that mr leonard broke hurdling records in college made paul curious about him paul confronts mr leonard about it because he wants the teacher to explain it this realization also helps paul understand that mr leonard has been coaching him because he wants paul to succeed where he didnt
the informatin paul recived aabout mr leeonard makes paul feel better pauls dont feel alone for not being able to read good because mr leonard didnt do good in school either
it explains his life as a teacher
paul knows almost exactly what mr leonard is going through they couldnt read but in pauls case he has a class he goes to twice a week that helps him learn to read better      mr leonard didnt want paul to end up like him but he felt that he had a connection with paul this whole time that mr leonard had been telling him on your way he had been training his mind and body to react to what mr leonard says when leonard took him out to the track and said on your way he was ready to listen he automatically responded to it by saying yes sir      when paul had found out what leonard was all about from when he went to the coach he was astonished he confronted mr leonard and asked him why he didnt tell him mr leonard explained the whole situation to him      from that point on he understood what he had to do he got as much help as possible and in the mean time got help for mr leonard
paul discovers that mr leonard failed out of college and lost his athletic scholarship because he couldnt read  this causes paul to sympathize with mr leonard because he knows how the man feels  they are both embarassed because of their inability to read so they both help each other  mr leonard helps paul improve his athleticism through track and paul begins to teach mr leonard to read  paul also realizes that he is not alone and that when another person helps you you can also benefit them
mr leonards background imformation effects paul because when mr leonard was young he flunked out of college because he said no one wanted atrack runner who could not read mr leonard is alo embarassed to admit he had flunked out of college this has an effect on paul because paul is not so good at reading and is embarrased to go to a learning center for tutoring this is why mr leonards background effected paul and pauls motivation
when paul finds out that the man who was coaching him at hurdling was a college star who broke national records he feels a little confused and more honored to be taught by someone like this supporting details that paul was confused could be when he brought up the page he printed off from the website where he discovered mr leonards past mr leonard didnt seem too enthused by it but paul continued to pry and find out what happened once he knew paul then felt empathetic toward mr leonard since they shared the same problem
the effect of the background information that paul found on mr leonard was that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals because of this paul realizes how important it is to learn and not give up in school i feel that being in track will make paul a better student and he will recognize how important learning is to make it through college
after all of his training with mr leonard poaul gets fairly good at jumping hurdles so good that he gets asked to practice with the highschool track team after telling the coach about who he had been training with the coach gave paul a url to the schools track website      paul discovers that mr leonard was a track runner when he was in school a very good one he won prizes and broke records paul was confused as to why mr leonard hadnt mentioned this to him before so the asked him mr leonard shared that he had been an excellent athlete but not a good enough student he wasnt given the opportunities or resources in school to improve so even though he was so good he was offered a scholarship he couldnt do the work and flunked out of college he was obviosly embarrased and didnt want to discourage paul because paul had natural talent
the background information that paul recieves just sort of gives him an inspiration to continue trying his best he learns from mr leonard the importance of studying and making good grades for example mr leonard flunked out of college because of his poor grades this point proves that without good grades paul will basically go no where and end up being a hall monitor
the narrator informs the reader that the coach was a college athlete that won the 400 meter hurdles in nationals witch means the coach has plenty of experence of running the track that information helped the narrator relizes that he is learning from one of the best and that he knows if he sticks to running he can do alot even if his grades are bellow average or that hes not a good reader
the effect of the background info on paul is that he realizes he is not alone
the effect that the background information has on paul is paul wants to be like mrleonard so he tries todo what he does most of the time paul just dont want to upset the coach so he does what he says anywayspaul may also want to be encouraged by mrleonard to do the right thing and be the perosn that he wants to be in lifeso in my eyes thats the effect that mrleonard background information has on paul
paul is deeply moved because he can relate with mr leonard about not being able to read paul wants to help him learn how to read since he is being taught at the learning center himself mr leonard never had the opportunity to learn when he was younger he is also surprised that mr leonard never told him about his track successes in college paul sees that he is a modest person who doesnt flaunt his gifts and talents
the background information on mr leonard that paul found out effects paul because both have reading problems mr leanoard states i was a good athlete but not a good student mr leonard has taught paul to become a good athlete as of right now paul cant read very good mr leonard had the problem of not being able to read well like paul has now
he feels empahy for mr leonard he knows how it feels to not do well when it comes to school paul feels embbarrassed when he has o ead aloud or doesnt know an answer everyone else knows
the effect of the back ground information is that paul wants to know more bout mr leonards life  after paul looks on the web site from the coach he finds out that mr leonard was a track person when he was in high school later finds out he cant read
paul gets the information about mr leonard from the high school track coach and not from mr leonard himself paul is a little disappointed the next day that he did not get the information directly from mr leonard paul asks mr leonard about his college career and he explains that he was a great runner but did not do well in the classroom this makes paul understand why mr leonard did not tell him about his track career and paul feels he needs to help mr leonard as he helped him
paul is confused as to why mr leonard did not tell him about his background information then he realized that just because someone cannot read does not mean that they cannot do anything else in life
after getting the informaton about mr leonard paul reliezes that even though he cant read he shouldnt not that hold him back
i think it gave paul confidence because mrleonard was not a good student like him but whent on to do amazing things in colage and setting many records i also motiveted paul to keep up his studies and use trake and a outlit from stress and school and to be able to fit in more
it effects paul because leonard cant read either just like paul but leonard teaches paul that a hurdle is just like life and you can over come it and do good in your future
the information helped the paul realize why mr leonard was helping him and when he finally figures it all out it only makes him want to try harder and also help mr leonard learn to read to when he says  cmon mr leonard its time to start your training
the background information that paul gets on mr leonard has an effect on him because it inspries him to help mr leonard since he found out he cant read so when he did he found that out he said cmon mr leonard walking back toward the school its time to start your training
the author learns of mr leonard off a web site and is cofused about his findingsso paul goes to talk with mrleonard to find out if what he has found is accurate this is in paragraph 35
the background information paul got about mrlenoard effected him because he knew someone who was very good at track was teaching him when mrleoard told paul he couldnt read and he flunked out of college because he couldnt read it made paul want to work hard paul helped mrleonard read
the background helps us understand the story more
the background information about mr leonard that paul is effected by is that mr leonard isnt the best reader ever and paul was going to the learning center for reading help paul thought mr leonard had gone to college paul had then found out that mr leonard was a track runner and not a very good student in school that had effected paul
the information that paul gets on mr leonard is a big part of the effect that he has on paul paul realizes that they relate to eachother alot and that it makes sense why mr leonard is being so helpful to him they share the same emotions  as paul says the feelings of embarassment when approached with not being able to read they are one in the same
the effect of the background information has on paul is that is shows him that mr leonard was just like him he finds out that mr leonard couldnt read either mr leonard says in the story that he couldnt read but back then there were no remdial reading programs he also flunked out of college because of it but the information shows paul that mr leonard is just trying to give this kid the help he couldnt get when he was in that situation
the information paul gets helps him because he knows now that you dont have to know how to read to be succesfull at things
the background information helps the narrator learn more about mr leonard and his past it also informs paul of why mr leonard is helping him with the hurdles on the track by looking up the background information paul learns that mr leonard was a famous track star that won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he also learns that mr leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he could was illiterate then he realized why mr leonard was so empathetic when paul said he could not read either
the effect that the background information the narrator has on paul is he was a great runner but he lost all of his things such as his scholarship because his grades were not good enough for the college he was accepted to
the effect that the background has on paul is that he is shocked because mr leonard didnt tell him about his past of being a former track player and couldnt read and paul had wondered why mr leonard was helping him
the effect that the background information has on paul is that mr leonard told him the college scouts told him that his grades didnt matter that he would have tutors to help him but also that he thought college is a whole lot harder than high school he went on to say that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of high school he mentioned that no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read the effect was that paul felt bad for him but he felt the same way so there wasnt much of an effect if there was any effect it was emotionally
when paul found out that mr leonard broke records in college but then didnt finish college made him confused when mr leanard told paul that the reason he couldnt finish college because he didnt take school seriously paul was surprised and knew that if he followed his dreams and worked hard at school and life he could accomplish anything since paul had the privilege to work hard in school and do a sport that he worked hard to be good at he would do anything to succeed mr leonard believed that paul had potential
the background information about mr leonard seems to help paul to try harder to strive for excellence  he is first a little suspicious when he is stopped and asked where he is going and why he is going to the learning center  he soon starts to be coached by mr leondard and forms a better relationship with him  paul grew really suspicious when mr leonard asked paul his name even though he checked pauls hall pass twice a week  then the track coach told him to do a search for grabowski on the internet  he finally realized who mr leonardd really was
paul finds out that  mr leonard also had a reading dissability in school  the first clue that hints this is when mr leonard asks paul what his name is  paul then wonders why he would ask that when he had seen his hall pass for days straight  once paul finds out about the dissability that mr leonard has he then becomes encouraging and tells him that they need to start training mr leonard for track  this whole situation has a very positive affect on paul
paul is shocked to find out that mr leonard has trouble reading also but that did not stop him from succeeding in a sport paul relizes that mr leonard helped him and feels that he should help mr leonard read now
as one is reading this section one may notice that mr leonard is from the start a very important man in the narrators life  one may also notice that as time goes on and after the narrator or paul recieves the url that he find not only helped paul but was also a famous runner  he had broken many records and was very fast at running  after paul asks mr leonard why he had not choosen to tell paul about his famous ascubuidy he discovers that mr leonard had flunked out and that he could not read  paul instead of feeling disapiontment one may feel that he gained respect for mr leonard  i believe this to be true because in this article paul says this cmon mr leonard  its time to start your training
paul was a track star in high school and collehe but he had a problem he did not amke good grade so there for he was kicked off the team and also out of college there for his track days were over
the background information that paul receives gives him more confidence because there is a grown man who went through the same things he was going through when paul found out that mr leonard couldnt read but still went to college showed that there was hope for him even though mr leonard flunked out he knew that if he pushed and worked hard at learning to read and with track he could go to college as well
mr leonard did not learn how to read well when in high school so when he found paul going to the learning center he felt the empathy to help him and train him the emotions in mr leonards voice were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew
it impresses him to see how good mr leonard used to be this also confueses him becuase he doesnt understand why he didnt tell him about his college successes
towards the ends of the story paul discovers that mr leonard was a very good track star and that he even broke records when mr leonard later revealed his story about how he always got by in life this sparked a light in pauls head he then relized that he to was turning out to be just like mr leonard the only difference is the paul was making steps to fix the problem at the end of the passage paul makes mr leonard follow him as he takes him on a journey to reading
the background information makes paul upset because mr leonard didnt tell him
paul reads that mr leonard was a great track and when he asks mr leonard about it he says that he lost his scolarship and flunked out paul can relate because he says hes one of the select few in the remedial reading program he feels empathetic for mr leonard and wants to help him learn to read and maybe help him get some of his confidence back
it really inspires him it shows him that mr leonard knows what he is talking about but is concerned at the fact that he doesnt know how to read so sense mr leonard helped paul with sport he is goin to teach him how to read
paul was a good kid in school he was one of the selected students in the remedial reading programs
when paul finds out about mr leonards past his attitude changes towards mr leonard paul begins to trust mr leonard more and is more willing to listen to his coaching advice it also makes paul feel less alone to know that he isnt the only person to have reading problems mr leonards story encourages paul to do the best he can in school and to not give up on his dreams
things were different back thenthe college scouts told him that his grades didnt matter
i think there is no effect on paul because he was just doing a background check on someone
the backgorund information is really important in this story or it would really have never ended the backgorund information came from the track coach just curious to see if paul would actually check it out he did and found out that the guy that was helping him was a real athlete but once paul talked to him paul realized that mr leonard had the same problem he did he couldnt read so for paul to find that out is pretty important because mr leonard will push paul to do and good in school and take his place as a track hero
he finds out that he was a track star in college for the hurdles he looked him up on the school website he did not know this at first and he wonders why he did not tell him he is curious why mr leonard did not tell him this
the effect the information paul finds out about mr leonardo is sympathetic he finds out that mr leonardo was a wonderful athlete but he didnt make it far because he couldnt stay in college because he couldnt read after finding this out paul wants to help mr leonard learn how to read
paul is surprised and confused he wants to know why mr leonard kept this from him
