crossing over 
roses head jerked up from her chest oh no she groaned rubbing the back of her neck and blinking at the bright light in the kitchen for a split second she was confused then she remembered her essay for the state competition shed been struggling to think of a topic her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion  
the day like most of her days had been too long too demanding from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework  
when would she squeeze in writing a flawless threethousandword essay im insane she said grimly as she gathered books and papers  even if i win she thought i wont get to travel to sacramento to receive the prize shed already had to miss a lot of shifts and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her 
her younger sister walked in rubbing her eyes  
anna rose said whats wrong you feel okay 
im fine her sister said  i just had another bad dream 
i fell asleep working on my essay rose said  
anna poured two glasses of orange juice and handed one to rose mamas not home yet is she it wasnt a question i hate how late she has to work her voice sank to a fierce whisper im so lonesome for papa it seems like hes been gone for years 
its only been four months rose said as gently as she could he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here 
anna glared at rose  money isnt everything  
only if you already have everything rose said she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her we have our part to do to help paul finish  college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college 
anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chai r away from the table you sound just like mama she stood and stalked out of the kitchen 
by the time rose tiptoed into their room anna was already snoring lightly rose slid into bed and watched the lights from passing cars move across the walls they became the lights that had illuminated the stage at pauls high school graduation as her brother accepted his diploma rose had glanced at her parents faces four eyes shining with tears the work the sheer weight of it to get him on that stage slid from them in that moment only a sweet triumphant ache remained surely they remembered the ship their young son and daughters clinging to their necks cambodia behind them the united states before them on that ship perhaps they had imagined their childrens futures imagined this very day would come
in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands  pauls fate lies partly in these she thought she felt too young for so much responsibility then she shivered imagining how her brother must feel only three years older he held the fate of two people both his sisters in his hands 
rose dreamed that she swam through clear greentinted water enjoying the pure simplicity of a fishs life she stopped moving and looked up she saw paul jump from a boulder and crash into the water just above her his body sank as if it were made of stone pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom she struggled to get out from under him but he seemed unaware of her when she opened her mouth to scream get off water rushed in 
rose woke gasping for air the walls of her room were bathed in pale sunlight when her heart had slowed back down she got up anna was still asleep in the hall rose stopped at her mothers room she was also sleeping so it was aunt kolab making the muted noises coming from the kitchen 
good morning rose her aunt said 
rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her after shed finished her aunt said with a puzzled look do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family 
rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother 
in cambodia our first country what were all doing would be quite normal her aunt said but now i realize that youre seeing the situation through other eyes as you should i suppose because you grew up here this must be difficult for you yes
rose nodded 
hmm maybe we can find a way to do things differently a way better for you her aunts face lit up maybe i can sew for ladies or i could make special treats from our country and sell them 
rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldnt but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter suddenly it occurred to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing

she is a very busy person and doesnt have very much time for what she wants to do and to be with her family for example this essay states how she barely has time for her writhing asignment when would she squeeze in a flawledd threethousandword essay
i think that rose likes to keep her feelings to hereself like shes shy or just dont like to talk about her problems
throughout the story rose has a motherly trait she is looking after anna while her mother is at work roses characteristic is also brought out when she explains how she is working to help put her brother through college the most improtant line that conveys this is when anna says you sound just like mama 12

she is sincere she tries to comfort her sister when she talks about missing her father rose tells anna that her father went to work because he already had everything else he needed except money
rose seemed like a very helpful person when she was talking to her sister anna she seemed this way becuase when her sister came to her to talk about things she tried to explain to her why things were the way they were
a trait that i see in rose is that she is very caring she is concerned for anna when she walks up in tears and she asks her whats wrong the whole time in there conversationg she tries to calm her down like when she tried to laugh to relax the tension between them
rose is tired she has a lot on her plate for someone of her age from work to school to homework and helping her brother through college she is having trouble taking care of all of it and just wants someone to help her get some of the weight off of her back
based on her conversation with anna rose can be seen as mature when rose is talking to anna she tells her that what her family is doing is necessary anna doesnt understand why their father has to be away in los angeles she also doesnt understand why money is so important to her parents this is where rose shows her maturity she explains to her sister the importance of their fathers job and why they need the money so badly
rose says that they have their part to do while paul is away at college this shows that rose is independent and smart
in roses conversation with aun kolab rose reveals her concern for other peoples feelings  her care of others feelings show up previously in her conversation with anna anna walks in feeling down but instead of venting her own feelings rose keeps them to her self and listens to her sister
honest because rose tells anna that helping paul would help them finish college then hell get a good job and hell pay for anna and rose to go to college

i think that accepting life is one because she tries to explain to her sister the way that life is going at the moment for them
rose at first only cared about the future of success in relation to money but actually she does not feel that she should complete the tasks to make it happen she doesnt want so much responsibility weighing down on her
a trait that describes rose would be responsible an example of how rose is a responsible young lady is because during her conversation with her aunt she doesnt respond when her aunt asks her do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family she does not answer because she knows that she has to help out in order for her family to be able to survive
considerate in paragraph 19 the author writes if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
one trait that stands out to me mostly in rose is fear of what she must do for her brother and how so much responsibility is laid on such a young girl according to the passage rose thinks to herself pauls fate lies partly in these referring to her hands that statement represents that she is thinking about what she has been doing for her brother to go to college and how her brothers getting into college shouldnt rely on her
she is really trying to help the family

the one trait that can describe rose is intelligent one example of this is that she is going to enter an essay contest
rose is concerned and is filled with self conflict didnt know wether or not to tell her aunt

from this story i think the best trait to describe rose is that shes unselfish  you can see why rose is unselfish when she talks about how even if she won the essay competition she couldnt go get her prize from sacramento because she wouldnt be able to take off of her work which helps support her family  this part of the passage helps you see that rose puts her family before herself
rose seems to be a strong person that can take care of her family even though she isnt the mother she is taking care of her and others responsibilities when rose fake laughed to help comfort her sister it showed that she actually cares and she is a motherlike figure to anna
i think that one trait of rose that i picked up from her conversations is that she is very hard working she shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her she knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college that shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life

rose seems like a very shy person in her conversation with aunt kolab the only time she actually speaks is to relay her dream then when aunt kolab gives her some advice she just nods several times and never vocalizes the fact that she was going to use the topic for her essay or that she was very helped out by aunt kolabss advice

she is caring for her sister because she was trying to make her feel better about their father being away she said it had only been four months and said he will eventually get a better job to put us through college
there are many different traits i could use to describe rose i feel that brave would describe her the best i think this because when roses aunt kolab asked is rose felt weighed down by her familyrose didnt want to answer rose didnt want to answer because she was prepared to take care of the family im my mind that is really brave

rose thinks that money is very important and determines your overall state of wealth and her sister doesnt in the story as rose and anna were talking anna says money isnt everything rose and then rose replies not if you already have everything and to me this is just like saying that rose wouldnt be happy unless she had everything
she said that she feels like she is the one who is supporting the family and that she feels weighed down because of it when rose is talking to anna she states how she feels about her father leaving and that upsets anna

rose is a person that tries to keep everyone happy by telling them what they want to hear and not exactly what she feels  she says that he had to go  she also refers to a laugh that came no where near soundind sincere
i think that rose is a giving person because she says maybe i can sew for ladies or could make special treats from our country and sell them
rose is considerate of other peoples feelingsrose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
i think anna comes off to be this really exciting girl who wants a life but she is too busy taking care of her family that she has no time to stop and think about who she really wants to be      from school shed gone straight to the resturant to work fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper then she would do homework
rose tries to look at the bright side by telling anna that everything will be fine but she is actually very worried

the fate of rose lies in pauls hands her aunts trying to help her by making her feel lighter and made her think of a topic
i believe that rose is careing in the conversation she had with her aunt kolab about the dream rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt i think that when someone puts someone elses feelings or thoughts before their own is a careing person
anna is a very smart girl and the reason i think that is because she was gone do a threethousand word essay
rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her
rose misses her dad terribly but knows hes just doing this job in los angeles to help pay for her brothers education anna misses him too and she says she doesnt care about the money she just wants her father back

to me rose seems like a competitive girl she doesnt want to loose meaning by that the fact stating she has to write a three thousand word essay rose says even if i win i wont get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize this means she wants to win she wont give up on her dreams
i think rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted in the passage it replies the day like most of her days had been too long too demanding from school shed gone straight to the restraunt to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework this example supports my answer why i think rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted
strong in paragragh tweenty three she realized that her family could survive an ocean crossing
annarose said whats wrong you feel okay from this part of the story i felt that she was caring
when rose says that he has only been gone for four months and he is getting paid three times as much in los angeles it shows that rose a mature and understanding person partly because she feels obligated to
from her conversation with anna rose shows that she is willing to do her part to make money even though its a burden because she knows that in the end it will be beneficial for her and her sister
she worries a lot about if she will beable to go to college or if she would be able to do anything this is shown when rose starts to talk about how her brother must have felt during the time he was there and that now that he is in college he might have to help pay to get his family higher in the world also with all the rsponsibility he had when he was there is now passed on to rosa which is causing her to not have any time to do anything
one trait that rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others and does not think about the affects on her when rose is tired from working and helping her aunt she must then do her homework she does not have much time to do so and is often too tired to even finish this proves that she believes she can help make a difference for paul and that he will return the favor even though rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part in the story rose supports this claim by thinking if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt this is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school but she knows what she must do and is afraid of hurting her family in the story rose is a hard worker and respects others feelings

rose aunt and her are  family and they love each other and they are nice  but it seems anna is jleus
standing up and and helping there brother paul get off to a good collage

rose dreamed that she swam through clear greentinted water enjoying the pure simplicity of a fishs life which means she loves doing cirtin things and other things not so muchrose felt like she was too young for so much responceability
roes is caring she worries about her whole family and wants to help make life better for them during her talk with anna roes says we have to do our part to help paul finish college showing that she wants what is best for her brother
based on her conversations with anna one trait that describes rose would be that she knows that theyve got to do what theyve got to do to get by for example how anna said she misses her father and that it seems like hes been gone for years but rose said he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
one trait that describes rose based on her conversations would be stubborn i think that rose is very stubborn and somewhat ungrateful she is stubborn because she complains about everything she doesnt take anything for granted and never wants to give up on what she wants in a way its a good thing that rose is stubborn because people cant take advantage of her and she wont stop trying something until she wins but on the other hand she can hurt people and can be annoying this is the trait i chose that best fits rose
rose is very weighed down by all of the stresses in her life her aunt kolab infers her struggling and offers to help rose in their conversation at the end of the story
rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
in the story rose felt lonely she said maybe if her dad came home for a weekend or her mom took a day off to be with the girls and help them out with school work maybe she wouldnt feel that way
rose has many traits t he one that stuck out to me the most is how hard wroking she is
anna dont really tell how she realy feels in her conversation with aunt kalob she dont tell her how she really feels about helping the family
anna rose said whats wrong you feel okay one trait of rose is that she is caring
one of roses character traits is that she is hopeful for a brighter future regardless of the present problems in her life as can be seen in her conversation with anna she recogizes her current stresses will help them get into good colleges in the longrun
she gets worked up easy she thinks about the essay that she has to wright and that even if she wins she cant go get her prize then she thinks about her brother and everything that her parents did for him and about money and why her dad moved so far away
one trait is exhausted she feels this way because she feels it is all up to her  her conversation with aunt rose verifies this
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with anna is that she is lonely  in the passage she talks about how she misses her father and wishes that her mother was around more  she shows that she really wants them in her life and is heartbroken that they are not
rose dreamed that she swam
anna is a helper she helps a lot around the house even though she does not like to do it
rose is a very busy girl often tied down with taking care of her sister anna and wanting her mother home but she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is at the end of this story she realized that she can survive this family splitting all by herself when she said suddenly it occurred to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing
rose seems very overwhelmed in paragraph thirteen rose is even troubled in her sleep about her overwhelming problems during the day this suggest that her life has become busy to the point of an overwhelming capacity
in this story rose bears a lot of responsibility everyone in the family must work in order to pay for pauls education which will help the family as a whole rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything she is conflicted to say the least
rose is a very caring person she gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family one example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to sacramento anyways she would have to stay home and take care of her family
she is stuburn and wants things her way because she just rolled her eyes and stormed out of the room
in conversing with her sister rose continually reassures her of the brightness of the future attempting to laugh and sound optimistic she herself takes on the task of writing the essay an unnecessary burden on top of her numerous tasks suggesting that she is trying to repress a feeling of doubt that she shares with her sister thus a prominent characteristic of rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her familys condition taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally
one trait that descibes rose based on the conversation between her and anna is that she is helpful in many ways to me it seems that rose is more of the mother figure in annas life and is there for her when she needs something she helps tries to help out with the money situation by working an example of the book of how rose shows this trait is when anna woke up and came into where rose was rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay
in the story rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone she saysif she told the truth she would hurt her aunt i think that rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so
rose is a hard worker and worries a lot rose is very persistent one example is in paragraph two im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do then how she has to work to help support her entire family
rose is helpful  she works to help support paul and the rest of her family  anna and aunt kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family
rose seems a bit overloaded according to her conversation with aunt kolab
one trait i found in this story about rose would be that she is caring her aunt kolab asked do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose is to caring about her aunts feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings
rose is a hardworker in the beginning of the story she explains going to school heading straight to work for a fourhour shift and then straight home to help make dinner after all of that she still has to do homework
she cares for her family when she talks to anna she said we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with anna  when she tries to to explain to anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help paul finish college she calmly speaks to anna even though she knows anna may not fully understand  even though anna clearly did not understand what rose was saying she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards annas retort at the end of the conversation  instead she remains tolerant which takes a great deal of patience on her part
rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful rose didnt answer if she tod the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mom this describes her puting her familly before herself
rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place when anna says it feels like hes been gone for years rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months and that they needed the money
i think a trait that rose has is caring rose is caring because she cares about her family and understands what things are going on and tries to help her sister understand she also is like a leader to her sister
she seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks whats wrong you feel okay and when the sister replies that she had a bad dream she doesnt ask why or what happend
she understands the importance of finacial need when she stated that her dad moved away to another job that paid three times what he was making before reveals that she has some intelligance in money
roses conversation with aunt kolab suggests that rose is very mature and responsible for her age roses aunt can see how much stress she is under rose doesnt say anything though knowing the family needs money to survive when aunt kolab says something to rose about being weighed down by helping the family rose admits shes under much stress
there mad that their mom has to work so latemamas not home yet is he i hate how late she has to work
one trait that describes rose would have to be that she hard working she works for what her family needs so that there lives can become better
she cares about her sister anna this is supported by rose asking anna whats wrong and are you feeling ok
when roses sister walked and asked whats worng rose tried to tell than she was fine that just she had another bad dream roses sister said the money isnt everything then rose tell to her sister than they have to help paul so anna dislike for that you sond just like mama anna wants to mean that rose start to think and talk like her mother
one trait that can descibe rose is exhaustedshe is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family she must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework
one trait that can describe rose based on her converstation with aunt kolab is that she is caring that she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person the statement that supports my answer would be rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mom that indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom she was probably scared it would hurt her mother too
rosa feels that she weiged down by her family and theres is not much she can do about it  the floashback that involved her brother  standing on top of her in the water sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help
the conversations with anna or aunt kolab was a good sisters relationship
one trait that describes rose based on her conversations with anna is pessimistic she doesnt believe that their life will get better as fast as anna would like it to you can see that by anna saying that money isnt everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees rose acts accordingly and compares anna to her mother which shows that anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story
1 she doesnt like to see people disappointed or u happy for example if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose is a selfabsorbed american teenager  she feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders  she does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard  her aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised  since rose feels she has to much burden aunt kolab says in cambodia our first country what were all doing would be quite normal
i think that rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life she works to help out the family but at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper i think that she feels the same way anna does but doesnt want to admit it with her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom dad or even paul
she works hard for her family she went to school worked for four hours after then had to help her aunt with dinner after she had homework that must be completed she had no time to finish the essay
she is wanting to make everything good for her and her family because her dad is gone so she is working very hard to keep up but it is alot of work and she is having trouble getting everything done in time like she came from school and went straight to the resturant to work for four hours then straight home to help her aunt make supper and then had to try to get a essay done and she didnt have a topic yet
rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people anna rose saidwhats wrong you feel okay
she is a very hard worker she works four hours at her job then comes home to help make supper and then writes her essay
rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money
rose did not want to hurt her aunt she doesnt like hurting people so she wasnt going to tell her aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family
hardworking rose is a very hard working individual she has school work housework and homework she takes on more responsibilites than she can probably handle but she does it all for the good of the family you can see roses hardworking efforts as she goes above and beyond to win a essay contest she puts more on her plate than she can eat but she takes every challenge head on you can tell she is working hard from the stress that is related to us through her character she is strong for her sister making everything seem just peachy but right when she has the chance she breaks down to her aunt lets her know how she really feels
one trait that can describe rose is hardworking whether she wants to do something or not she still gets it done an example from the story is the fact that she goes to school works a four hour shift right after home to help her aunt  prepare supper and then does homework
rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis i know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper because of school work preparing supper and doing homework
rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl rose has reoccurring dreams about things of her brother an example would be she has a vision of her brother recieving his diploma and she also has a dream of her brother jumping from a boulder and sinking down upon herself as if he was made of stone
one trait that can describe rose based on her converstations with anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are  one example from the story that shows this is when anna and rose are talking about her father being gone and to anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone  rose jus responded with a simple answer of its only been four months
that rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
rose said  whats wrong you feel okay that is a trait of love
rose is a rather optimistic person although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off whether it be for paul her parents or herself
rose feels very weighed down because she has too much on her plate and it drives her insane because she also has to do a bunch for her family too and she feels presured not to give up and to help as much as she can and i know this because of when she had that conversation with her aunt at the end she had her aunt explain what she was feeling in a different perspective
rose is very selfless she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself
rose is very caring about her family she sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay along with her family to get her brother through college of course it doesnt mean that she is happy about it all the time but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can
she dont like to her peoples feelings because she dont tell her anut the truth about whats really makes her feel weigh down by what shes doing to help her family
even if i win she thought i wont get to travel to sacarmento to recieve the prize
to try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress in the story she tries to make a  joke on how money isnt every thing to poeple that have everything
she hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others like when she didnt want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt
it is easily surmisable from the text that rose can be described as burdened  it is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her
one trait that i saw in rose during her conversation with anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it also that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive for example rose said to anna we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
rose is a nervous person shes saying even if i win i wount get to travel to sacramento to recieve the prize
rose and anna both have a hard time writting an essay when they get mad they dont want to do it anymore and they walk off
rose is paranoid she is paranoid with how her life is going with her mother working late and her father moving away to work somewhere else  this is shown when she keeps having bad dream
i feel asleep working on my essay said rose                                               rose was doing her essay and she feel asleep and had a bad dream and she woke up scared and anna ask if she was ok and rose said yaq i am ok
one trait i identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felta detail from the story is when rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay she was more concerned about the essay then roses bad dream or how she was feeling
the one trate i would identify rose with would be understanding she shows this trait when she explains to anna why papa had to leave
i think she is desolate and worn out she works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself
rose feels overworked and wants an easier life this based on when aunt kolab asked her if its difficult for her to imagine life in cambodia
rose is very responsible she spends her days at school then going to work then preparing supper and then doing homework she is dutiful because she is trying to prepare for her future at college and helping paul pay for his
one trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with aunt kolab is that you can really feel what rose is actually feeling you can almost make a connection with rose and how she has to deal with life for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt so you get a feeling of how rose feels on the inside too you feel that she really cares for her family and doesnt want to upset anyone
rose has a great trait the trait she has is willpower rose does a lot for the family and she doesnt really ask for anything in returnrose didnt answer one of aunt kolabs questions because she didnt want to hurt her feelings
rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not selfcentered she is an trustworthy person and is very reliable and she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit
rose is under a lot of pressureparagraph 3 says she has to write a flawless threethousand word essay
she had a lot of flash backs and it was coming all back to her sister because it was about her brother
rose is a very afraid to let any one down  this trait is both good and bad for her personality  it is a good thing because she is always there when someone needs something  she would do anything to help someone around her  it is bad because as roses dream shows us rose can be taking on to much and doesnt know how to let it all go and tell people she cant handle it
rose is very well at thinking before she speaks in paragraph 19 she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt
rose is a caring person she wants her family to be well of and live a good life she did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father i see rose as a caring girl
one trait that can discribe rose is she woulod like everything to be her way and if it does not go her way she does not wont to do itann is mom home yet  rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer
rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings  the reason i say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probabaly her aunt would tell her mother
when rose is talking to anna after anna pours two glasses of orange juice rose says that she is lonesome for papa he has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years
she works really hard and its for her family she would do anything for her family and they would do the same for hershe is over working herself though she needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house but she does it anywayfor her brother
in her conversation with aunt kolab we can see that rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt aunt kolabs feelings or that the aunt would tell roses mother and it would hurt her mothers feelings
rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings in her conversation with anna she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help paul get through college it takes a strange dream and some probing by aunt kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation
i think that rose is strong in the story it says that she was talking to her sister in the kitchen and that she was trying to help her sister understand their situation and help her come to better terms with it even though she felt the same way
i think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that she is worried she is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down the dream in which paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer
they are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to los angelous for his work  they both knew that he was making more money that ever
one trait that i can see in rose is that she doesnt want to her her aunt by telling her the truth  also by listening to her aunt kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier  i think the reason is her aunt kolab seems to help people see the good in life
one trait that can describe roses trait would be while shes listening to aunt kolab she doesnt directly answer her aunt cause shes afraid of hurting her aunt or her aunt telling her mother for instance aunt kolab says do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose only nodded
she is a busy body cause she always has stuff to do
busywhen would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
she is always busy
rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with aunt kolab as her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things rose nods away at what aunt kolab says although she still questions it in her head she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future
that she is worried about her family
rose seems to be very kind she didnt want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with anna
rose is a very busy girl she has to deal with being in high school having a job helping her aunt kolab with house work and she has to write a three thousand word essay
one trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring  i think rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad  rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money
she grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in cambodia she has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking  her down to the bottom of a body of water and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes
based on her conversation with anna rose can be described as caring because she puts her sisters needs before her own although she needs to write a three thousand word essay she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father
rose is very thankful even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt what her aunt did was take some stress away and give rose a little hope
one trait that rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family  this appears when she is talking with anna in the kitchen after they both wake up  anna says im so lonesome for papa  it seems like hes been gone for years para 8  roses response is he had to go  the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here para 9  this shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all
rose can be described by hopeful  she is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future  when rose and anna are talking at the beginning of the story rose talks about how once paul finishes college he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college
rose was nice to her sister at first but then kinda got angry in the story they were talking about their dad and rose made anna mad
i feel like rose is very stressed in the second paragraph the first sentence rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesnt feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay
personally i believe that rose is sincere she is trying to help her family to the best of her ability but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances in this story rose goes through her todo list for a typical evening you would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going i wish we could all have her sincerety
the one trait that rose has is to work hard fo rher family to get by without some of her family memebers i get this support because her sister and her have a talk about mone yand that her dad is gone and her mother works a long shift just to get money for them to survive
one trait that describes rose is a hard worker  she goes to school every day then goes to wrork and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework  she still get everything done and that is why rose is a hard worker
she isnt very happy
i would say rose is an understanding person in the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family she is understanding of why her father has to live in la and why her mother has to work so late she is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get she is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding
rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family but the pressure only weighs down on her more this is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister anna despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely
she seems hopeful even though she has it rough when she was telling her sister about how paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didnt really believe it was going to work out
she seems iritated and tired because in the story she wakes up and says oh no and groaned this shows that she is very unpleased and that she is very tired and irritable
she cares about others she didnt answer her aunt because she didnt want to hurt her
she is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast
she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family and writing 1000 word essay than the pressure for paul
rose tells anna and aunt kolab that she is in some way being weighed down rose had a dream that paul was holding her down
rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things in the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wanna hear
i believe that in the story rose is a very brave responsibal girl during the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country
in the story the conversation with rose and aunt kolab would describe rose as a helping person she dosent mind helping out in the family but meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother
rose is dismissive and a little passive she answers her aunt truthfully but only with nonverbal communication this shows shes dissmissve for the subject
rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her a rough job taxing schoolwork and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else from school shed gone straight to the  restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework
well she is caring and nice
rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to aunt kolab she is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother
concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late 
rose seems to be worried about money in her coversation with anna a detail that supprts this when she brings up the fact that her dad is making more money now  away from them than he did with them
in the passage crossing over rose has many different traits but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility when anna wakes up from a bad dream rose checks on her and asks her whats wrong this suggest that she is wanting to take care of anna then when rose is talking to her aunt kolab her lets the reader know that rose has a big resposibility with the family when her aunt says do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family this implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family the two examples that are given are small but imply much more that rose is almost like a second mother for her family
rose is
one trait that can describe rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves rose and anna have to help paul finish college and when paul is out of college hell pay for rose and anna
one trait that rose shows is compasion she cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the united states rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate she does so many things to be accomplished that she doesnt care how stressed out she is all she wants is a good life for her and her family
rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time when her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer
rose is responsible when it says from school shed gone straight to the restaurent to work a fourhour shitft this shows he responsibilty and what position she holds in her family
rose feels like she is being weighed down and cant help her family when rose is asked by momma if she is weighed down and she looks at her and just walks away ignoring her
in the tory when rose said to anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college this shows a trait of being optimistic also whe talking to her aunt although she said things probably wont get much better she stayed on the plus said and said maybe they will
one trait that can describe rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when anna said she doesnt care about money and she wants papa home thats being selfcentered  rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family
rose is unhappy and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better she doesnt want others to see her as someone who can only take so much an example of this is when roses sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay she tells anna that they need to do this for thier brother and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be she also jokes about money with anna as if things were alright with money at this time
the one trait i think that describes rose is that she is caring i say this because when she was talking to her aunt she wanted to tell her the dream she had she ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her
rose seems like a very open person she uses personification when the narrator said rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her this just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly
rose is caring her conversation with anna shows this rose asks anna if she feels okay
during her conversation with aunt kolab rose doesnt tell her how she feels this shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother she also says that to anna that he is the one that can help them get to collegeshe is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college
one trait that can describe rose is respectful because when aunt kolab asked her do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose doesnt say anything because she did not want to hurt her aunts feelings or her mothers
she is very sincere and thinks about other peoples and cares about other peoples feelings rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose feels weighed down because of how much shes trying to help her family she feels like she has to carry most of the problems in the conversation rose has with her aunt kolab towards the end of the story her aunt specifically asks her if she feels weighed down by what shes doing to help her family and rose doesnt answer it gives proof that she does not want to tell her aunt or her mother
they are in the same family and like roses
rose had a talk with her aunt and it made her ffeel alot better then she actually felt
anna is very hardworking  she says that she works a shift at a job somewhere  she also has to keep a veil of confidence up for her younger sibling in order to keep her from being frightened
rose is frustrated i think shes frusterated because she has a very big essay to do and no parents to help her and she has to take care of her little sister
rose is a girl who is always putting her family first though she fights with her sister and has terrible dreams about the weight put on her shoulders that she explains to her aunt she still always tries to put her family first she takes the dreams shes been having and relates them to everyday life in cambodia and later finds a topic for a state championship essay that would help her family out greatfully
rose talks to her sister anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money  rose doesnt like that her mom works so late and her dad had to move so he could get a better job for his family  anna said it helps them a lot because of the money they make but all rose wants to do is see her dad and mom more
she is very brave it takes alot of courage to write a long essay like that and have to present it at a state competition she is also brave for talking to her aunt about what is going on
rose tries to put things lightly so that she wont hurt others feelings this becomes apparent when she is talking to anna about their father and trying to comfort anna
rose works too much she works after school and has to do her homework and come back and take care or her bothers and sisters
i could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her her aunt sees that and offers to make some stuff to sell that comes from her country
one trait to describe rose would be guilt because of the dream she has about paul jumping off the boulder and landing on her in the water
in roses conversation with anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation when she explains to ana that he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here it is apparent that she is telling her this just to make her stop worrying rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation
she understands how important school is
based on her conversation with anna rose is an understanding person anna is still young so she can not fully understand why her family is working so hard rose explains to her its for the enitire family for her brother and themselves rose overworks herself with school and work but she knows its for her family so keeps on perservering ignoring the fact that she feels too much responsibility for her age
rose judging by her unwillingness to speak about how she felt to her aunt kolab works as hard as she does because she does not wish to let her family down
when rose is talking to her aunt kolab her aunt tells rose that now she can tell that rose is seeing the problems and situations through other eyes i think what she is saying is that now rose is seeing life in a new perspective that now she doesnt just think that their family is having a hard time financially that now she knows by trying to be a part of the problems and help to resolve them
one trait to describe rose would be optimistic in paragraph 11 rose is talking to anna about money and rose makes the comment that their part is help paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college their family is having problems and their dad just moved away to have a better paying job and rose is looking on the bright side and how the outcome will be good if they just dont give up
rose was a procrastinator in the story she put off writing her essay until last minute then she couldnt think of anything to write
she thinks its all about moneyanna glared at rose money isnt everything     only if you already have verything rose said
one trait that can describe rose is hardworking the story shows this when it talks about how most of her days are long when she has to go to school then the restaurant then home to help with dinner and finally to do homework this relates to her conversation with aunt kolab when her aunt can see how hard she is working and how exhausted she is when rose comes down in the morning her aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family
rose is very willing to persevere and accompolish her goalsone could seen this in the end when she is talking to aunt kolab   rose kept nodding  mayber her life would get easier
rose doesnt like to say her true feelingsparagraph 21 line 1 and paragraph 23 line 1 it says she just keeps on nodding
rose to me seems like a very understanding person she listens to her sister when she is resentfull about there father and mother and tries to explain it so that she can better understand the situation herself rose also shows that she is understanding when her aunt comes to her with more ideas on ways to help out there older brother paul
roses sense of responsibity is evident in her conversation with anna her ability to suppress her own feelings to try and make things easier for her sister is a great personal trait
rose is a very determined person you can tell this from the story because she is working hard in the resturant making dinner for her family at home and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time by reading conversations she had with her aunt kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person aunt kolab says  do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family also shows that rose is a very determined person
she is hopeful that her future will be worth the work she puts in she just needs to make out of this rough patch in life
rose is caring and trys to comfort her sister anna when anna is down because her parents are never home rose says to anna in the story that he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away
rose to me seems to be a very hard working person in the story she tells us she has work most days right after school then help with dinner and finally do homework by this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone she doesnt like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person she is making sure she never disapoints her family she knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education
im so lonesome for papa it seems like hes been gone for years its only been four months this tells me that rose is a family girl she is not happy unless her family is with her and supporting her she is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in los angeles
she is strong inside because even under pressure she tries to help her family
rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family  rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school  she works instead of plays so that her brother can get through school and take care of her rather than the other way around
one trait that that can decscribe rose based on her conversation with anna would be worried my example from the context would be anna rose said whats wrong you feel okay
she is very hardworking and she cares about her family in the story it says that after school she went straight to work and straigh home to help prepare supper
she in a way feels like she cares about the essay but if she does win than she cant pick up the prize anyway so she feels that there isnt realy a point in trying to win and her schedual is already realy busy as it is
anna is from cambodia but grew up in the united states and she is seeing stuff diffrent then her aunt who grew up in canbodia
rose is a very responsible girl she has more of a load on her than most girls her age would she worries about money her brother and her father her aunt kolab says that what they are doing is normal in cambodia this makes rose feel better and relieves her of some of the stresses that she feels in everyday life
i think that rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better rose wouldnt tell aunt kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didnt want to hurt her feelings
caring when she is talking to anna she does as much as she can to be nice and comfort her about what is happening
rose thinks that there is something wrong with anna
rose is a hard working lady that wants to do good things for herselfshe is wanting to write this three thousand word essay but cant fit it into her schedule she wants to become a winner
i think shes affraid to tell people whats wrong with her if there is something bothering her she would rather keep it to herself and deal with it other tham telling somebody about it that will help her
one trait of rose seen in her conversation with anna is a selfish trait  anna is attempting to confide in rose but rose just pulls the conversations topic back to herself

rose is a carring person when her sister came into her room she took her down stairs and gave a glass of orange juice to calm her down
rose is a the type of girl that wants to do anything possible to please everyone she knows she wants to be known as dependable the one detail that comes to my mind is when rose is thinking about writing that essay eventhough she is very busy with working but she wants to win the prize
rose tries to hide how she really feels when she talks to anna she tries to sound reassuring even though she is worried for example she tries a laugh that sounded fake even to her
rose is very dedicated to her family an example of this is when anna says you sound just like mama
she acts like her mom and says the same things her sister told her she sounded just like their mom
anna is very courageous she doesnt mind working hard for the family even though it might hurt her an example of this is how she works a four hour shift after school to bring in money to help pay for her brothers schooling
a trait that rose can be described by is realistic  she realizes the importance of her dad taking a job in los angeles because it pays three times more than what he was making  she knows that the money will go to good use by putting his children through college
hardworking rose understands that she and her family must work hard to get what they need in life she works hard to help pay for her brothers college knowing that once he has finished school and gets a good job he will help pay for her college in paragraph 11 she states this
rose is very considerate although she probably resents that her father must get a job in los angeles she understands the greater goal behind his reasoning and tries to explain it to anna she knows that all of her family members need to help each other succeed
rose care about what everyone thinks  she listened to anna and helped her get over her bad dream  she also cared about what aunt kolab had to say because she was trying to make live better for rose
persistent
in the story rose feels depressed as if she has no way out this gives her the trait that she is confused about her family
she acts scared from her dream when she saw paul sinking in the water on  top of her and she couldnt get out from under him
shes needs to be more open with her aunt instead of being scared
rose is a realist this is because after anna says money isnt everything rose says only if you have everything
fatigued at the beginning of the story she has a hard time staying awake because her daily schedule is so demanding
fiesty  you sound just like mama she stood and stalked out
that she puts stuff off till the last minute my proof of this is i fell asleep working on my essay
she does not want to write her three thousand word paper  she has two conversations with people but yet she doesnt work on her paper
her aunt talk about how life going to change

rose is wanting someone to take care of her example is that when her brother gets out of college she said he will take care of us
rose asked her younger sister if she was ok and asked why she was up so early her sister said because i had a bad dream
rose doesnt want to let her family down but she feels obligated to keep quiet and not tell anyone how she feels its weighting her down and stressing her out in the story aunt kolab can sense that rose feels like shes being weighed down just by her emotions
rose is very mature  she has numerous responsiblities but she is mature enough to see how imperative it is that she complete them she does not try to push all of her responsibilities onto someone else
one trait that can describes rose in her talk with aunt kolab would be attentive rose was attentive when she kept listening and nodding to what her aunt kolab was telling her
in paragraph 11 rose states to anna that they both have a part in helping their brother paul through college and in return he will put them through college this shows that rose is generous she knows that by doing all she can to help her brother he will return the favor to not only her but her sister anna also

she is a hard worker  she goes to work right after school for a four hour shift then goes home helps with supper and then finishes up with her homework

rose is a caring person when rose and anna were talking rose asked her what was wrong which showed that she cares about how her sister feels also she cares about her family because she doesnt want to let them down with writing her essay
rose seems to be a negative person based on the way she avoids anything truly positive in her conversation with anna
anna is hard working and so is aunt kolab
they have already done everything they can

rose is optimistic about her future in life we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
roses conversations between anna and her herself show how independent she is when talking to her younger sister she acts like her mother and watches over anna instead of ignoring her sister like some older siblings may do rose asks anna what is the matter and checks to see if shes alright as anna continues to worry rose tries to reassure her that things will be fine in the future as long as they work together rose assumes the responsibility in the absence of her mother and doesnt rely on anyone to do work for her
rose  felt  an  urgent  need  to  relatd  the dream  to  expose  it  so  it  would  loosen  its  grip  on  her
emotionaly tough she is going through alot of stress yet she still trys to comfort her sister when she is sad
she is not a very happy person even though she tries to come across to others as being hopeful and joyousrose kept nodding maybe her life get easier maybe it wouldnt
rose does not want to her family to assume that she is lazy or that she feels overworked by helping her family because she cares for her family and feels guilty in a way by feeling overly busy  an example of this is when she says do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose didnt answer  if she otld the truth she would hurt her aunt  and probably her aunt would tell her mother
rose is very responsible as her telling anna about their duty helping paul finish college shows
rose is very strong she had to show no emotion with little sister anna anna was angry that her father has been away for so long but rose is explaining to anna that he needs to make money to  keep paul in school rose misses her dad too and wishes they didnt have to work so hard to make money but she has to be strong for her sister
she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her
anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table
rose is a lonely person rose had glanced at her parents faces four eyes shining with tears
even though shes as stressed as she is she still cares about others it seems like she is used to putting others before herself
one trait that can describe rose is caring rose is caring because she works hard to earn money for her struggling family so they can pay for paul roses brother to finish college
she doesnt like hurting other peoples feelings especially her familys rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
that anna is her little sister and that they hate when they mother is always working late
rose is overwhelmed you get this idea because whenever you look at the things rose says you can imagine the feelings that are going through her one of the examples would be the essay rose is overwhelmed with her busy life that shes barley having enough time to just write an essay for the contest
one trait that best describes rose is responsiable rose show a great deal of responsablity because she is dealing with a lot to help support her family at such a young age and when he little sister begins to feel tired of the situation as does rose rose explains to anna without grief that what they are doing is the best for the family we have our part to do to help paul finish college rose said to anna she explained that in the long run and the troubles have settled that it will benefit them
rose has sympathy for people she does not want to hurt others feelings in the story it says that if rose told the truth than it might hurt her aunts feelings
in roses conversation with anna it was clear rose is very supportive of her family rose works a part time job that takes up most of her time trying to make enough money to help her brother attend high school this shows that rose is very responsible and knows that she is doing what she must to help her brother with his future
one trait that describes rose is caring in her conversation with anna she not only asks if she is okay but speaks gently to her in order to try to ease her pain
one of roses traits in the story is being insercure about herself
she is just like her mother
one trait that can describe rose is she is a  understandying person and takes advice from her elders very well an example from the article is last paragraph rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easiermaybe it wouldnt but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter line 21 rose nodded
on trait that describe rose is that she has alot on her mind like resposiblities when she is having converstions with her aunt and sister she often thinks about other things
i believe rose is forgiving and it shows she is when her and anna are talking and rose said the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
rose cares for others feelings in the 19th paragraph rose didnt want to teel the truth to her aunt because it would hurt her feelings
her sister walks in and she ignors the eassy and tends to her sisteranna whats wrongyou feel okay
i think that rose can be described as caring but once it gets to a certain point she just starts to care about herself
when anna walks in from her bad dream rose is nice to her but than when they get to talking about her mom not being at home and working they start to argue a little  like when rose said he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here anna said money isnt everything
rose is busy  rose is always doing something wheather it is writting an essay dreaming taking care of her sister or talking to her aunt
it is evident that rose is stressed based on her conversation with aunt kolab who simply nodded instead of showing a positive attitude when kolab told her of how normal her feelings are and her hopes
one trait that identifies rose is that she likes to make other people happy with her siste anna she hid how she was feeling weighed down and tried to make her sister feel better with her aunt kolab she didnt want to tell her the truth because it would hurt her and her mother
rose realized she was a stronge person and could get through anything
rose is the type of person that is curious someone that gets to the bottom of thingsrose felt an urgent need to relaye the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her
one trait that can describe rose would be concern the morning when her and anna talked about their dad being gone and all the problems within the family rose asked anna if she was okay and rose tried to talk to anna and make her feel better and try to get anna to believe everything that was happening was happening for a good reasoncause
one trait is that she is really upset as stated from the text four eyes shining with tears
shes helpful she doesnt quite like all the work she must do but she continues to help and tries not to complain even though her aunt kolab can tell how rose feels by listening to her dream she didnt ask for a relief of her helping efforts but she did appreciate it but is still willing to help if she is needed to
rose is a very kind hearted person i can tell this because she listens and talks to people when they need someone to talk to
rose akways looks on the bright side of thingsshe knows she can do anything
frightened rose woke gasping for air
she is caring of her family by trying to make anna feel better about their situation
rose demonstrates a very hopeful attitude in her conversations with anna and aunt kolab when anna complains about never seening her parents rose responds by explaining how their jobs and the familys current situation will eventually work out for the better
rose is carimg i think she is this way because when she is aunt kolab she doesnt complain on how she feels about working to help pay her brother through college and how her mom is never home and how she isnt getting her school work done very well because she is tired she just moves through the day because she has to do this because its her family and she would do anything for them
rose is somewhat selfish compared to the rest of her family  they had had to brave coming to america from cambodia  rose had no idea what cambodia was like and how bad it was there
rose doesnt beleive in paul
rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister annas life  anna feels discouraged and resentful towards how hard she and her family must work to put her older brother paul through college  rose reasures her that once paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister
rose is very busy with her life and doesnt think that she has time to appreciate or have time to do other stuff she really wants to do
she is caring because she mentions how hard she is working to help out her family
rose is compassionate because even though she is exhausted and trying to work while going to school she still tries to calm her sister she tried to make anna feel better about her father being away
that they are like each other  they talk like each other
based on her conversation with anna one can deduce that a defining characteristic of rose is her selflessness it is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college she is understanding of the familys position and is doing everything in her power to improve it
she seems uncaring and ignores what her sister anna or how she is feeling for example when anna says i had a bad dream rose continues on with her problems and never asks  about the dream
exhausted i feel asleep working on my essay rose said
she tries to find a away to suppres her feelings
anna cares for and wants to know if there is anything wrong with anyone anna is not greegy but likes to share with others
rose is sympthatic person towards anna  when anna came in to the kitchen at the start of the story rose asked whats wrong  anna said im fine i just had another bad dream  rose replied trying to be funny and sympthatic at the same time i fell asleep working on my essay she gets up and goes pour her sister a class of orange juice
one trrait that rose has is shes selfcentered  shes selfcentered because in a conversation with anna she hinted her that money is every and in a conversation with aunt kolab she wanted her to go to work to make more money
annas trait is that she is truthful she told her sister what she had to do which was get over dad being gone and help paul get through college
rose has a maternal trait  this has been shown through her conversation with her sister anna  for example when she speaks to anna the author says she uses a gentle voice
she is very angry for some reason
nosyask to many questiopns
when rose was talking to her aunt kolab i think that rose is just being selfish and just doesnt want to help out with anything shes basically only thinking about herself maybe i can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them her aunts offer made her feel lighter
i think that she is faithful becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help in the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of cambodia things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats
she is very devoted to her school work she wont give up in the story when rose is talking to anna she talks about her essay then when she talks to aunt kolab she talks about her topic for her essay
that rose and her aunt both know how rose feels in their family situationroses aunt asks her do you really feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
one trait is that rose is a caring person that loves and respects her aunt during her conversation with aunt kolab rose did not expose her dream to her aunt because she did not want to hurt hers or her mothers feelings
i think rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family aunt kolab mentioned to rose that her parents and aunt kolab went through similar situations in cambodia
based on her conversation with anna the reader can conclude that rose is a strong person for the sake of her younger sister she puts on a brave attitude and sincerely assures her sister that all the promblems and conflicts within the family will soon be ressolved we know that rose works very hard in everything that she does mainly for the sake of her family       in the begining of the story we read that rose feels very worried that she wont be able to finish an essay for class do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family however when she is having her conversation with anna rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister this suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story i believe that this little action shows that rose is a strong and hearfelt person
she is very wise like in the conversation with anna as she said that they needed to get their parts so thier brother paul can pay for their colleges
 do you feel so wighed down by what youre doing to help  this family rose feels too much pressure on herself she has bad dreams
rose is a friendly person she does not get mad or upset with anna when she came into her room
rose is a very worrisome person she worries about what her future holds for anna and herself she feels that the weight of the family is coming down on her and cant help but to be bothered by the situation that she is in she feels the her brother will not be able to pull throw and will hurt her and her sisters futures of going to college just as he did my supporting detail is as she lies in the dark she cups her hands and says pauls fate lies partly in these
rose is conflicted she feels like she has too much responsibilty in helping the family yet feels like she must help
caring rose says we have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job
one trait that describes rose is the way she supresses her true feelings  she knows that paul getting a good job and paying for both herself and anna to go to college is basically impossible but she wants to believe its true so she doesnt have to worry so much  one detail to support this would be the when rose cupped her hands and though about how hard it must be for paul to have all of that pressure on his shoulders
rose is strong in her conversation with aunt kolab she is careful because she doesnt want to reveal to her aunt that she is exhausted from working and going to school rose fears that tis may dissapoint her aunt and her mother she feels weighed down from all of her responsibilites and doesnt think that all of this is necessary but she does this with a good heart
rose is dedicated but feels pinned down shes wishes for alone time and free time but knows she has the duty of helping her family you know this because she has a part time job and because of what she says to her little sister we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay foe you and me to go to college this shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return
rose has a tendency to not let others know how she is really feeling an example of this is in paragraph 11 sentence 2 when she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her this shows that rose is hiding her true emotions so that she can make anna feel better about their family situation instead of voicing her doubts she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation
she is talkative
rosa was kind to aunt kolab when she didnt answer the question  she didnt want to hurt her aunt
she believes what she wants to believe according to the passage the quote we have our part to do to help paul finish college and then hell help pay for you and me to go to college rose believes this because if she helps paul finish school then she is putting her foot through the door
shes a very busy girl and tries to get tasks done she goes to school then goes straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help her aunt prepare a quick supper after that she does homework
one trait about rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them during her conversation with anna she is constantly trying to make anna understand whats going on so anna isnt so angry at everyone in the family during her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on rose through these ideas rose realizes how important family is
rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother      this statement shows that rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesnt want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping aunt kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to rose this helps rose a lot because now she knows that someone is there to help because rose is too young to have to be worrying about helping get money and should be worried about school
i believe that rose feels tired but she still wants to help her family in the story her aunt asked  do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family i believe she does feel weighed down but she is a hard worker and that is her trait i am speaking of
rose is just do down and depressed with her whole life the way that she talks and the way that she tells t he events that are going on in the story
rose is  careing person she firsts askes her sister is she was okay then rose states that she and anna play a big role in helping paul finish college
rose is very considerate she did not want to aunt kolab her real feelings on the situation because she was afraid it was going to hurt her instead she decided to take in all the responibilites given to her and do the best with them and that concluded to rose possibly having a change in her life
rose is very considerate to the feelings of others  when speaking to rose she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation  she speaks about paul and how he will eventually come back to help them
she is very imaginary the walls of her room were bathed in pale sunlight
rose is a hard working girl who is trying to support her family now because her father is away for right now she goes from schoolto work then aunts then she has to try and get her homework done all in that days time
rose always thinks about her family rose said to her aunt do you feel so weighed down by what you are doing to this family
one trait that would describe rose would be helpful rose is help ful because she help around the house and help paul finish college in the text it says we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
rose is a good listiner when she is talking to her auant kolab she dosnt say anything and just nods in consideration
rose is very optimistic when it comes to a conversationarguement with her sister because she put in all kinds of examles that could be put as relieving or helpful
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab is maturity rose is very mature for her age rose gets out of school goes strait to work for a four hour shift comes home to help her aunt with dinner and then tries to find time to complete all of her homework rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from cambodia rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with anna although anna says she misses her dad and that money isnt everything while rose says that they need the money and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is responsiblity an example from the story is when anna comes into the kitchen and complains about her and roses parents being gone so much and rose explains to anna that their parents need to be where they are to help give their brother schooling which will in turn give them an opportunity at schooling it is also revealed that anna sees rose as responsible when she says you sound just like mama who is a mature and given to seem as a responsible person
rose cares about other people because she doesnt want to hurt her aunt kolab when she asked do you feel so wieghed down by what youre doing to help this family sentence number 12
rose i think is like basically any other child  i mean she didnt want to make her aunt feel bad so she didnt actually claim a lie she seems sad and depressed  cause if her dad not being home and all  the work she has to do  i mean thats hard on a teen  and depressing
strong this is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical she is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is she works goes and most likely excells at school because she is involved with the competition and also helps support her family
rose is very respectful and thinks before she speaks in the story rose kept nodding to aunt kolab she did not want to answer aunt kolab because if she told the truth she might hurt her aunt and her aunt would tell her mom instead of saying anything she just nodded and her aunt already understood
one trait that can describe rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family one can see this when she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
she dont pay attention too anna and anna dont pay attention too her
rose has faith at the beginning of the story she was almost stressed at the fact that she had to write an essay and hadnt started yet but then by the end of the story she realized that her family and the way they were doing things is to help each other then since she never gave up on the essay all of a sudden the idea came to her of her essay topic
she feels very stressed about the burden she has on her she has a job a threethousand word essay to do and a little sister to worry about
one of the main characteristics that appears in the story is burdened when she is dreaming of her brother like a stone on top of her in the water it displays the pressure and the burden that she is plagued with
rose is a caring person one reason she is caring is because in line 19 she didnt want to hurt her family by telling them the truth the truth was that rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family
that rose see it as she the olny one that matter and dont see it from another person point of view rose see it as family is way more important than anything one thing about her is she get angry to fast and dont sit down and think about things
a triat of roses is that she is a queit person  in both conversations rose didnt say much  in the conversation with her aunt kolab rose kept nodding rather than speaking  this trait has a likely cause and can be related to the situation showing that the trait can be proven to be true rose is has a very stressful and abnormal life at home with her family
one trait that i thinks descibes rose would be hardworking she goes to school and then straight tp her job and then has to worry about typing a huge essay
rose optimistic person when anna says money isnt everything rose responds with only if you already ahve everything
she is very responsible by trying to help paul finish college and shes doing everything she can to help her family
they are try to see if rose is having too much work for her to handly by herself since she have school to do to the restaurant for a fourhour shift then help out with the family
rose is caring she cares about her family even though it is not her resopnsibility to do so she also worries about her brother and sister and wants what is best for herself and her family
rose is doing everythimg she can to help her family because she knows its what her family is expecting of her she supresses how she feels because she doesnt want to sound ungrateful nor does she want to make her family upset  she hesitates about telling aunt kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her because she doesnt want to hurt her aunt or have her aunt tell her mother she speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to but she doesnt agree wher sister because she feels it wouldnt be fair and her sister wouldnt understand her  she is a very honorable responsible and helpful daughter but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she cant take it all
rose is hopeful when she talked to her aunt kolab it had said maybe her life would get easier when they had that talk rose saw eye to eye with her aunt and no matter how bad things had been she had hoped for better days
rose has a helpless attitude in the story her little sister says money isnt everything rose responds to that by saying only if you already have everything this shows that rose has in a way given up
she seems like an optimist because she doesnt get angry about her dad like anna does
rose is stressed aunt kolab can see that rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family
rose could be considered protective towards her family when her little sister anna says im so lonesome for papa it seems like hes been gone for years rose attempts to consul her sister by saying  its only been four months he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here also rose is working extremely hard in school and at work to help support her family a sure sign of a desire to protect and help her family
rose is a girl who seemed to always be stressed out she freaks out an anna which kinda gives it away
rose is a very responsible girl she just wants what is best for her family you can tell my the conversation she had with her little sister anna although they are going through rough times rose understands that her father is doing the right thing for the situation and she is greatful that he will pay for their college although she isnt happy that her father isnt around she is very mature in the sense that she can see her fathers good intentions
one trait that can decribe rose is caring she cares so much about her brother and wants him to graduate from college and will do anything to help him do so
a trait i can identify from roses conversations is that she cares about people in her famil  for example in paragraph nineteen it says rose didnt answer  if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
doesnt want to hurt anybody  if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
shes caring because she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings by telling her that she did feel weighted down by what shes doing to help the family
rose is very mature  she helps support her family and tries to do her best at what she can  including her school and job      she shows this matuirity in the conversatin between her sister where her sister describes her as being like their mother     you sound just like mama
one trait is that she is busy all the time but yet she is a hard workerone detial that supports my answer is that she can barely squeeze in a threethousand word essay
rose ithinks money is everything and that she needs to have it a detail from the passage is when she says the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
rose is hard working and a very respectful girlthe story states if she told the truthshe would hurt her auntand her aubt would probably tell her mother
shes a caring person because she asks her little sister how she is feeling and whats wrong
she is very kind in both situations she never raises her voice and tries to tell her point of view without making any one mad
one trait to describe rose is that she is caring on top of her threethousand word essay she has to finish she still makes time for her sister she gives her sister some supporting words also she is worried about her brother and parents
rose cares about her aunt because in paragraph 23 he aunt is telling her how she can make things different and rose says maybe her life would get easier as a sing that she cares about her
stressed out because she has to help out her family and do her school work
rose is a hard worker and always is pushing herself to the limit this is proved by her taking on the tasks of helping her aunt as well as the essay even though she is busy she tries to make time for all that is necessary
hard working from school shed gone straight to the restraunt to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework
rose is helpful because she helps her aunt make dinner
based on her conversation with her sister anna rose seems to be quite understanding when anna complains to rose about their father being away rose takes the time to explain to anna why it is their father is in that situation instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister
anna is understanding in what is going on with in  her family and how she plays a part in working through the situation
in this story an example used to describe what kind of person rose is would be we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job  anna and hell pay for you and me to go to collegeparagraph 11 line 34reading this and the part of rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think rose is a person that wants to succeed
she said that she just wonted to be like a fish and beeenin the water all the time when she was talking to to her aunt she told her she was just misssing her home country of combodian
durring roses conversation with anna she sounds like she feels that she has to understand that her pappa has to be away from home and that she has to look after anna and help her family
rose trys to be thoughtful of her sister and aunt but she has the essay that she has been working on she goes on to say that if she wins we wont get to travel to sacramento to reive the prize she wants
i would say a good trait to describe rose would be that she is very caring an example from the passage would be when rose professes that we have our part to do to help paul finish college i beleive this quote shows roses willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life
one trait that describes rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is caringin paragraph 19 rose supresses her feelings so that she wouldnt hurt her aunt this is just one example of how rose is a kind and caring person
that she is stressed out on helpping pay for pauls college funds while shes in school doing workshe fell asleep and had a nightmare of paul drowning her with the weight he has bringing
one trait that can describe rose is respectful she did not tell her aunt the truth about how she felt because rose did not want to hurt her aunt
based on the two conversations with anna and aunt kolab you can tell rose just wants to get rid of a lot of stress in her life most of the stress is caused by her parents but her brother is also a contributing stress factor
rose is very understanding we see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with anna she understood that papa had to work to put paul through college while ana did not seem to be so understanding
rose seems to be very stressed and has had a lot of responsibility put on her after telling aunt kolab about her dream her aunt looked at her and asked do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
rose is understanding about everything we have our part to do to help paul finsh college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to anna and wont risk answering how she truly feels to aunt kolab for fear of hurting her rose is more concerned with the wellbeing and feelings of others than her own and it seems plain as day as you read this story
she seems like she is overwhelmed she has to do this essay for a state competition when would she sqeeze in writing a flawless threethousandword essay help her sister calm down to go back to sleepi just had another bad dream anna says rose talks to her until she exits to bed she has a job that she is struggling to keepand her supervisor was on the verge of firing her a family to help take care ofstraight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper and a lot of expectations to do as her brother didshe felt too young for so much responsibilityimagining how her brother must feel
in the story rose is a very mature girl  she realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed  it shows how mature she is in the story when she explains to her sister the importance of papa being in los angeles  rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like mama
she is simalar to her motheranna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table you sound just like mama
one characteristic that we see of rose is her sense of realism when rose is talking to anna she talks to her about helping paul finish college toward which anna feels resentment rose talks about money and other worldly things that trouble her
rose is very busy and has to much on her hands and she doesnt get enough sleep rose goes to school than she goes to work and works a fourhour shift than goes home and cooks dinner for her sister and aunt and has to still finsih her homework
one of roses traits include being always busy  she always has something that she needs to do
rose is very lonely and she feels very sad like when she had a convorsation with her aunt she wanted to try something new to make her happier
i would have to say that rose is a hard work because it said she worked a four hour shift after school then came home to help with dinner nd then had to work on her essay
based on roses conversation with anna you can tell that she cares for her younger sister and the rest of her family she tries to comfort her sister by gently saying its only been four months when her sister talks about how it seems so long that her father has been gone
that she is real open but hessitent to to say what she really wants to because she doesnt want to hurt aunt if she tells the truth
the one trait i would use to described rose would be helpful i believe rose is helpful because she not only goes to school but she helps support her family in the story it said that roses brain must have surrendered to exhaustion and it goes on to explain why rose had a paper to write but she fell asleep because of the school day she had earlier and the fourhour shift she had worked at the restraunt prior to her coming home
rose is a type of person that think s about her furture she can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose it makes her think about a lot of stuff
a trait rose has is believing in the passage she is worried at first about her family and isnt sure if things will get better because her moms never home and her dad doesnt live with them because he got a better job in los angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them after rose had a talk with her aunt kolab she started believing that she can help make things better and she would do her best to make that happen
she is really caring and sincere when talking to her aunt she tried to hold in her feelings about her responsibility in the family so she wouldnt offend her aunt or hurt her feelings
one trait that rose possesses is being compasionate towards others  an example of this is when she is talking with anna and says anna whats wrong  you feel okay
rose is worried about if she will be able to go to college or not because it all rests on her brothers shoulders in the story she talks about paul finishing college and getting a good job to pay for them to go to college
i believe she could be seen as a patient person because in both conversations she listens to anna and her aunt and then gives her opinion on the issue at hand
when rose was talking to her aunt kolab it showed that she was hard working that she was tired of all the things she had to do for her family
rose was aften discouraged and did not feel positive towards many things and hurt her loved ones at times
rose exemplifies the trait of self doubt rose constantly ponders the idea of her life becomming easier but never truly beleives herself when talking to aunt kolab the author states  rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier rose is showing self doubt in this situation by not thinking her life cause become easier and instead thinking her life may become easier
in the conversation with anna rose shows that she is encouraging and an optomist she tries to help her sister understand the situation as kindly as possible  rose even tries to lighten the situation between anna and her  she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her  this shows that she knows the seriousness of the situation yet wants to make her sister happier
rose never loses hope  she always no matter what situation she is going through is hopeful  she knows if she pays her dues now and helps get paul through college then he will return the favor
rose is considerate she works hard on her school work and she does her best at her job so she can help her family even at her young age when rose is talking to aunt kolab she refrains from telling her aunt how she really feels because she doesnt want to hurt her or her family in paragraph 19 if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt she is considerate of her familys feelings and their situation

rosa seems to be a hardworking young woman despite how weighed down she felt she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family she even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay she said to anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college
rose wants to be the big person she wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesnt on the inside this is brought out especially during her dialougue with aunt kolab she doesnt want to tell aunt kolab the real situation because she is afraid that she will tell her motherthis is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought      if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably        her aunt would tell her mother

when her sister walked in the room and rose sead whats worng you feel okay

rose doesnt care about much of anything else besides herself in the story rose just completely ignores her sister after she comes out and says she had a bad dream

roses aunt sugests making treats from their country and selling them aunt kolab wants to share their cambodian tradition with the people of their new country and help them understand cambodian tradition while at the same time she wants to make some money to help the family out

rose is very protective to her family  she works had every day by going to school working four hour shift then home to help her aunt  rose tries to be the best she can for her family by never giving up even if she is exhausted
rose is very hopeful in the passage the author states rose kept nodding mayber her life would get easier

one triat about rose is that when she tells about her feelings she doesnt really express them too much anna seems the same way like if she does have alot to say and that she feels a certain way she doesnt express it well anna just keeps everything inside like in paragraph 910 when anna  rose were having a conversation the topic about their father was that rose felt hes been gone forever an that the job he has now in la pays really good money than the job he had at home ana who look at rose she was like money isnt everything to me it sounded like she is very upset that her dad is so far away and that anna does really miss him
she understands and listens to what others have to say when anna was talking to her rose helped her out she explained and help rose understand some things she tried her best to make anna not feel so lonely     when she had a conversation with aunt kolab rose didnt really talk about much she doesnt like to talk about her feelings she likes to keep her feelings bottled up inside

one trait of rose is she is very faithful she wants her family to be happy even if she is not you can tell this when she is talking to anna telling her that everything will turn out for the best it will just take some time
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab would be that rose is a very busy girl with very little time on her hands  the day like most of her days had been too long too demanding from school shes gone straight to the resturant to work a four hour shift then go straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper
rose is caring because when her sister walks in rubbing her eyes the first thing rose asks her is if she is alright
rose is caring when she talks to other people because when she was talking with her aunt she thinks if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt this shows that she cares about how other people feel
according to this particular story rose is depicted as discouraged the story explains how aunt kolab asked rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family and rose had no response signifying a sense of discourageness or hopelessness
rose feels in urgent need to relate to her dreams but yet she is very exposed to the fact that the truth might hurt she is starting to relize she needs to see things throught others eyes not just her own
stressed because she is in a situatuion where she has to support her family and when she talks to her aunt she expresses her stressfulness
rose wants the best for her familybecause she talks to her sister about going to coledge
she is a very worried person that has alot riding on her shoulder so that she can go to collage and then send monry back so that her sister can go
rosa tries not to upset others she tries to make them feel better by saying we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college to anna
rose is very sincere in paragraph 8 sentence 1 it says that rose said  its only been four months as gently as she could she wanted to help her realize why and wanted to do it so anna wouldnt get mad at her
i think that rose is stubborn because when she and her sister were talking shen got mad and walked out of the kitchen
she tries to be the mother of the family for her sister anna its only been four months rose said as gently as she could he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
in the story rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done  she feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders  in her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear greentinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her  this symbolizes that she cant get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to  when she talks with her aunt after the dream she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it  one trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she cant live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish
she trys to help her sister out when she thinks her father is not spending enough time at home with their mother rose tells her sister that their father had to go and that the job paid more and it would help to go to college
she is always looking to the future like in the second sentance of paragraph 23 she said maybe her life would get easier
one trait that best describe rose based on her conversations with anna is hateful she didnt like the fact that her mom is working extra hours at work also she hated that her father is gone away on a bussiness trip
rose had many traits in this story but one that stud out to me was her welling to do everthing she gos to school works helps her aunt and deffends her father about what anna is saying
rose was always determined to write the paper and win the trip she never really enjoyed the paper but she set her mind to it
rose is very determined because when she first talks to anna she doesnt seem to care about what rose is trying to accomplish then when she talks to aunt kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her aunt forgiving her encouragement
a trait that describes rose would be her great helping attitude with her family after school she would go to the restaurant and work four hour shifts then she would go home and help aunt kolab with supper for the family after that she had time to work on her homework she put the needs of others before the needs of herself
she was stressed about the competition and how she was going  to enter when she has a job to attend to she talks about this and the dream she had because she was also conserned if it meant something in her life that has been currently being going on to support this answer she says even if i were to win she thought i wont get to travle to sacramento to recieve the prize
anna is a dreamer not in a sense of sleep but of ambitions shes always talking about going other places like the green tinted water in her dream
responsible would be a trait to describe rose she has a job to pay for pauls college
one of annas traits is that she is jealous of paul because he is in college she gets mad when other people try to stand up for him one example is this passage is when rose told anna that paul will get a good job after college and even pay for them to go to college she just rolled her eyes pushed the chair aways from the table and told rose she sounded just like their mom
rose is first of all stressed out because of the things going on in her life with school working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt coming home and helping the family with supper and then homework and sure enough itd be time for bed soon after so during her conversations with anna and aunt kolab you can  tell she has a stressed out tone and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done done
she feels her life is hard since she is trying to help the family get through hard times aunt kolab do you feel so weighd down by what youre doing to help this family
rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings when rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunts feelings it shows how she feels about tothers feelings
rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family but cannot tell her aunt kolab because she would hurt her aunts feelings this trait comes from roses conversation with aunt kolab when aunt kolab asks her do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
one trait that can describe rose is supportive  as rose talks to anna in this story she keeps telling anna how everything will work out  rose has other thoughts about the situation but she keeps them to her self to make her younger sister feel better about the situation  she tells anna we have our part to do to help paul finish college  then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college  this shows that rose no matter how weighted down she feels will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright
rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing an example from the story would be we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
in this short story rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her papa has to work somewhere else for money it states she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her rose which tells the reader that rose is trying to hide how tired she is and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family from that aspect of the story rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family
respectful if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things i think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasnt done yet but i think that she just had to realize what he most important thing was after all
she worries about everyone except herselfshe feels that she has to take on a big responsibility for her family
rose is very strongwilled because when anna said to her money isnt everything rose immediately snapped back and disagreed with her
when rose wanted to expres who she feel and the dream  she had but she didn know how to a example is when rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell  her mother
rose wants to help her brother get to college to get a good job in the future so her and her sister can hopefully go to college someday one detail from the story is when she says that her brother has both of his little sisters fate in his hands
rose has a lot of stress and responsibiltiies after telling her aunt about the dream
she is scared rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
she is only thinging about the money end of life and not about living for the moment anna tells her this by saying money is not everything
i believe that two obvious traits that rose possesses is hope and courage though she was troubled by how her life had been upon talking to her aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself she knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened
she does not tell the truth to her aunt so she does not hurt her
i think her conversation with anna made her seem like she is a very caring person of how she was asking whats wrong or are u feeling ok
dragged because of the dream she had the night before that she told her aunt
rose has a positive attitude towards papa being gone she reminds her sister why hes gone and points out he will be able to pay for thier college when he is done working
rose is guarded she doesnt want to let her guard down and this is obvious when her laugh sounded fake even to her
one trait that can describe rose is selfless during the conversation with aunt kolab rose doesnt want to answer aunt kolabs question or tell the truth about her true feelings of being such a big part in supporting the family rose didnt want to hurt aunt kolab or make her feel bad
rose felt tha her life would get easier
rose is a hard worker she takes many things upon herself such as helpinh her brother graduate
i find her stubborn or rude really in her conversation with anna anna is upset because her father is away rose completely subsides the sadness anna feels and begins speaking of money
one treat that can describe rose would be positivety  during her conversation with anna rose told her that they have their part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job and that hell pay for anna and her to go to college  even during hard times rose still told anna that eventually things would work out and they would get to go to college as well as paul
she is busy because she has school work and help make dinner it also says when would she squeeze in writing a flawless threethousandword essay
hopeful           maybe her life would get easier
from hearing her aunts point of view rose not only found her topic for her essay she felt lighter from her aunts offer to help her rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldnt but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter suddenly it occurred to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing
anna is very caring about other peoples feelings in paragraph 19 it reveals anna didnt want to hurt her aunt kolabs feelings if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab rose seems to have trouble with internal conflicts  she is fighting a war with herself that makes her feel that she has too much resposibility placed on herself  for all of the work she has done for her older brother she wonders how her life would be different if she had not been forced to do so much work
one trait that can describe rose when she is talking to aunt kolab is when she thinks that her life might get easier maybe it wont but she has a topic for her paper

one trait rose has is maturity matuirty is represented in paragraph nine when rose is explaining why her dad had to move away she is explaining it like it is what is best for the household
one trait that i believe can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is calm i think this is a good trait to describe rose because while she was talking to her younger sister anna she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her her aunt was talking about ways to make rose feel better as rose listened to her aunts suggestions she calmly nodded her head in agreement to her aunt
one trait that can describe rose is stress why i say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time also she has a long essay to write along with fixing food with all of this going on its going to cause stress on her which is causing her dreams since she realizes this she goes and talks to her aunt even if she wanted to hold it all inside
she is someone who can get very discouraged easily cause she is always worried about how late her mom has to work also about getting all her homework done then going strait to work she thinks she is always pushed for time
that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
she has alot of frustration in side that she wants to let out but has to hold back and the reason that i think this is because she says if she would of answered and told the truth she would of hurt her aunt
when rose is talking to anna in the kitchen you get the sense that rose wants to please her family she feels weighted down by all she has to do yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like shes fine when rose and anna are talking about money rose tries to make light of the subject by making a joke and laughing although her laugh sounds fake even to her
in the convorsation rose had with her younger sister anna she seem to be strong she was being postive about the situation with her father i feel she was being this way towards her sister to give her comfort and make it seem like things arnt as bad as they seem
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is with aunt kolab rose is an american she doesnt remeber cambodia therefore aunt kolab has to teach her of cambodia with aunt kolab deciding to bring a little of cambodia to america when aunt kolab says hmm maybe we can find a way to do things differently a way better for you and maybe i can sew for ladies or i could make special treats from our country and sell them

rose is determined shes not only worried about herself but paul also rose said we have our part to do to help paul finish college shes willing to do whatever it takes for her family so paul can get a good job and her and her sister anna can go to college
she is a very egar person  
faith in the story she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job
they both worry
only if you have everything rose always seems negative with no hope
rose is misrible and she knows it however she tries not to show it and wants to stay strong for the sake of the rest of her family  aunt kolab asks rose do you feel so weighted down by what youre doing to help this family  rose didnt want to answer her aunt out of fear of harming her or her mother  to rose other peoples feelings matter more
one trait to describe rose would be pressured rose is constantly busy her job family and a threethousandword essay are occuping her time in cambodia our first country what were all doing would be quite normal roses aunt said to rose near the end of the passage this detail suggests that roses aunt and parents are used to the pressure that they might not be able to see things through an american girls eyes
rose was fed up with everything she had to do and she wanted her dad to come home she still worked and did her homework rose did not complain so i would say she is patient
rose is very caring she encourages her sister that everything is going to be alright and life will get better for them even though she is feeling doubtful in herself she assures anna that their dad is away to make things better for them and be able to send them both to college
she is always hopeful  we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
i think rose seems to be caring about not just herself but of her family in the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling she cares fro paul she also helps out aunt kolab
they both have attitudes
she is very mature because of the way that she talks to her sister about helping the family out at such a young age
she feels very stressed out why is that because the story says she felt to young for so much responsibility
helpful greatful and loving money isnt everything
she is a very worryfilled person when she states that she dreamt of the weight of her brother on her shoulders in the water
she seems very confident that something may happen when she was having a conversation with her sister in the kitchen she looked at the positive of their father working is los angeles
anna is stuggling hoping her life would get easer
rose can be described as hardworking in this story she is very hardworking because she goes straight from school to her job and then home to help aunt kolab cook supper
shes a little grumpy because when she comes in sounds like shes giving attitude to everyone which dont make her look good
one trait that rose has is that she is very cautious of others feelings and tries to not upset them an example of this trait would be when aunt kolab asked rose if she felt weighted down by what she was doing for the family and to avoid hurting aunt kolab she didnt respond
she is very weighed down but at the same time she is doing it cause she has to help her family  she is a very giving person by giving up her time to work for her brother and make money for him to finish colledge  from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper  after thst it ws time to do homework
she is very unopen with how she really feels to the rest of the family even though she is struggling with everything she tries to make them see positive
rose shows that she can be very understanding of other peoples thoughts  when she was talking to her sister she tried to show that she understood how her sister felt  when she was talking to her aunt she understood that life in cambodia was much different than hers
burdened his body sank as if it were made of stone pushing her beneath him down under him but he seemed unaware of her
rose wants to please the people in her family  she often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family  for example in paragraph 19 rose held back from telling her aunt kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family
i believe that rose is overwhelmed by having to go to school and work one example is that her aunt offers to sew for ladies or make special treats from their home country and sell them to bring in some extra money
in the story rose changes the subject when anna reveals that she had had a bad dream this shows me that rose is too concerned about her own problems also aunt kolab starts offering to do extra work so that rose wouldnt have to do as much work and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is
she dosent want to hurt her aunts feelings so she doesnt anwser her aunt that proves she cares for her family and is a kind and caring person it decribes her
one trait that can  be described about rose is that she is a very hard working person who just wants the best out of her familys lifeone detail from the story that represents my answer is when she was talking to anna about how she was explaining the situation about the family and how if they help paul finish college he could get a good job and help support the family

her trait is that she can see things form anothers point of view eplination when her and rose were talking she was looking at the situation from pauls point of view
i think one trait that describes rose is that she sounds like her mom  when anna and her are talking on paragraph 12  you sound just like mama
i think rose tries to help the family out a lot but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her while rose was talking to her aunt kolab her aunt said do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose only nodded and fell silent i think this shows that rose is young and does a lot for her family
one trait that can descibe rose would be that she is opptimistic she keeps thinking everything is going to get easier in the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier
she doesnt want others to be upset and keeps her bad comments to herself she is not use to the way they are living because she didnt grow up in cambodia

rose wants to help her family no matter the cost this shows that rose is an unselfish person as stated in the story pauls fate lies partly in these she thought she felt too young for so much responsibility then she shivered imagining how her brother must feel only three years older he held the fate of two peopleboth his sistersin his hands

rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister in a way she is protecting her sister and keeping annas hopes up her sister probably looks up to rose so she needs to seem confident so anna wont lose confidence but when talking to her aunt she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go because her aunt has the role of helping rose and rose helps anna and together they can help each other have faith
one trait that describes rose is hopeless at first in this story rose is talking to her sister and seems very down she is explaining to anna that maybe one day they will have it good she doesnt even seem to believe her own words when rose is talking to her aunt kolab she is also coming off as a hopeless person aunt kolab says something that turns her attitude around

one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that she is willing to do anything for her family she has many things going on in her life that she would like to spend more time on such as writing her essay the fact that she has to work at the restaurant and come home and help with supper shows that she is doing everything she can to help her family through their problems even if that does mean that she cant always do what she wants to
she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help the family  the detail is that she does not want to answer and tell her aunt the truth because it might make her sad
one trait that i found that could describe rose is she is a kind person one example of this is when rose is talking to her aunt and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family what rose did not say should how she was a kind person in paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how rose is a kind person

hopeful after talk with aunt kolab she felt lighter
rose and aunt kolab are both hard working kolab works late every day
when anna fell aslepp doing homework she always seem tired and lonely she doesnt like how her mom has to work late hours and she think that she shouldnt have to
based on roses conversation with anna rose trusts her logic more than she trusts her emotions whereas anna complains that she would rather papa be home than making money in los angelos rose reasons although she misses papa the job in los angelos is better paying and they need the money for paul to finish college
one trait that describes rose is that she is like a mother  she is always thinking in advance about the future and what she can do for the family

rose is empathetic and can understand what others are going through even when she is haveing a hard time example she felt too young for so much responsibility then she shivered imaginining how her brother must feel only three years older he held the fate of two peopleboth his sisters in his hands
she cares a lot about her family and she doesnt want to let anyone down one example in the story is she says  i feel like i got a lot of responibilty and i have no idea what to do
rose is a little bit selfish when her sister came into the kitchen form just having a bad dream rose didnt say anything but i fell asleep working on my essay instead of comfortig anna
roes thinks that shes the only one trying to do good for the family when she speaks with anna she has a tone about her that explains how she thinks she knows everything but she also felt to young for all the responsibility that paul put on her thats why she couldnt tell her aunt about her dream
rose is hardworking she goes to school then heads off to the resaurant she works at for her fourhour shift heads home to help her aunt make a quick super and then she started on her homework
rose has a very devoloped sense of family she didnt want to answer aunt kolabs question beacsue she thought it might hurt her aunt or her mother would be upset she also decided to write her essay on the topic of cambodian tradition and that same sense of family
anna feels like she needs to do her part in helping the family out but she feels like it is taking away from her life as in not having time to do what she wants such as writing her essay
shes not used to the business of america like her aunt says in cambodiawhat were all doing would be quite normalnow i realize that youre seeing the situation through other eyesas you should i suppose because you grew up here aunt kolab means how rose is more used to the way life went in cambodia then the way life goes in america
a trait that rose has is caring about her family shes not selfish at all in the story rose states that money isnt everything and even though she missed her father she understood that he had to go to los angeles for the money
one trait that can describe rose is hardworking the author of the story says that she feels she needs to do her part to help paul get through college she is working to help him because she knows he will return the favor to both her and anna
i can tell that she is very open minded about things that she has to sayand she doesnt have an attitude problemand she loves her little sister
rose seems like a person that is caring she seems willing to help her family even though she is having a difficult time with everything going on just as it says she has an essay to write work school and other things at home
confused because she has an urge to talk about it with people to find out what to think of it
she tries to hide the way she feels  rose does it by not telling her aunt how she feels when she asks if everything is ok
rosa is always busy she never has time to do anything she always goes to school then she turns around and goes to work when she is done there she goes home and helps her aunt cook a quick supper she is a very busy girl she hardly ever has time to do anything
the conversation with her aunt kolab was good when the one with her sister anne was not so good
rose seems like she is not verry caring to anyone and i think this because of how she was rude to anna in their conversation
she sticks up for her mom and dad in the story rose and anna started talking about their moms job and how she works so late and how her dad had to leave for a job that payed almost three times as much and how she hated it but rose stood up for them and said they had too
one trait rose has is that she is a hard worker she has to work go to school and fine time to do homwork but she gets is done
when rose is talking to anna she tries to tell her sister how much she cares for paul to get his education in college that way so that he can pay for her and anna to go to college
rose is a caring person in the way that even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesnt want to concern the rest of the family with the matter so she keeps it to herself
she is not rude when she told her dream she was not rude about it she was more respectful
we have to do our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
rose is kind with her sister she shows this by being compasionate with her sister when she wakes up in the middle of the night and she explains that dad left because the pay was three times what it is where they live
rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relatives feelings after roses aunt asks rose if she feels overwhelmed with responsibilities rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings or her mothers feelings
anna gets angered really easily an example of this would be while talking to rose she tells anna one thing and she storms off to her room
rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her aunt kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt  the author writes if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt  and probably her aunt would tell her mother
resentful she is trying to just push away her feelings by hiding how she really feels about her dad going away for his job
it seems like to me that she tries her hardest to make light of the situtaion with her and her sister she made a joke about money anna said that money wasnt everything and rose tried to make a joke and said only if you have everything
rose is strong she manages to comfort anna instead of giving into the tiredness she feels
she is responsible  at least she feels responsible for everyone  if she didnt she would have ignored anna and got on her paper but istead she tried to comfort her and make her see the situation differently and that it will change
roses charcter can best be decribed as stressed she had to take on so much responibility for her families sake and she just cant take it like when she didnt say anything after her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by her family she didnt say anything because she didnt want to up set her aunt but she secretly wnated to say yes
rose is busy a lot and does the best she can i say that because of this quote from school shed gone staright to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper
rose is a overcaring person she care for her family and want to help however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself     it is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare she envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive ultimately she is drowned when she attempts to tell her brother to get off of her and  water enters her lungs this suggests that she feels that she must help her brother get into college and her family get money and that she feels guilty for her shortcomings
rose likes to caarry the weight of the world on her shoulders
i think that rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others and that she is afraid to express her real feelings it says that she was afraid to tell the truth because she thought she would hurt her aunt rose doesnt trust her voice because she doesnt want to say anything offensive and therefore most of the coversation she had with her aunt she remained quiet she seemed ashamed at even telling her aunt the dream but felt she had to so she wouldnt feel alone
one trait that describes rose would be fighter she fights to keep a job and go to school she fights through being tired to help her aunt with her sister she fights with knowing that her essay and her dream to winning that award may not come true becuase she loves her family enough to help out
she dont care when her sister anna was talking to her she did not care what she was ssaying because she started on another subject
rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things she had to do a flawless threethousandword essay if she wins she gets to go to sacramento to receive the prize when she was talking to aunt kolab it is obvius that the kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back
scared and troubled if you ask me i think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him she is troubled because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands
rose is quite uncaring considering how she ignores her sister and how she complains that she does too much work
rose is responsible because she goes to work making money to help her family out  she does this while also keeping up with her school work and with urge to help her family
she is understanding like she understands why papa has been gone
i would describe rose as comforting she tried her best to make her sister feel better and understand the situations taking place within the family when she woke up from a bad dream

rose is veryunderstanding in the story rose understandes why her dad has to work in los angeles and tries to get anna to understand as well
rose is understandable  in the story when anna was upset about their papa leaving for the job she could not understandbut rose understands completely  her family needs money and their papas new job paid three times the salary of his last job
rose is a giving person she will do anything to help her family we have our part to do to help paul finish college
rose has a great attitude
rose trys to be a positive person pargraphes 912 show that she trys to look on the bringht side of their dad leaving to los angeles
rose is very compassionate and is always mindful of others this is shown in her conversation with both her sister anna and aunt kolab when she talks with anna rose tries to make anna feel better about the fact that their father cant be with them when she talks with aunt kolab rose avoids telling her how she really feels in the interest of keeping from hurting members of her family
one trait that rose claims is the fact that she does not wish to hurt her family members  although she is very stressed out when her aunt asks do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings
when she  talks to both of  them it seems  like she  does not want them to worry about her because in both of the  conversations she avoids telling them how she  truely  feels and whats wrong to keep them from worring
even though things are not going so well in the family rose tries to make the mood lighter by trying to laugh that sounded fake even to her
hopeful because when anna mentions missing papa rose assured her that they didnt need him and that if they were to help paul finish college and get a good job and then he could pay for them to go to college
rose is a very mature young woman you can see this when she explains to her sister why her mom and dad do the things that they do to get money it would be very easy for her to complain but she doesnt and this shows her maturity
roses family is always busy working her mother and father and even herself after school for a fourhour shift
when rose talks to annaonly if you already have everything she feels guilty
one trait that describes rose is cautious just because of the way she chose her words carefully in both conversations
rose is a very giving and thoughtful person rose is helping her family by getting an education and even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down for what she was doing for her her family rose didnt tell her the truth on how she really felt
i can see that rose tries to be positive about life with her sister anna when she is telling her sister that they have to do their part so her brother can finish college and pay for rose and annas college
rose is a very conflicted person although she loves her family she feels resentful that she has to put so much time and effort toward trying to support them for example when she is trying to convince anna that supporting paul is important she doesnt completely agree with what she is sayingshe tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her
rose is a hard worker and is trying to do her part to help her family for example rose states that anna and her have to do their part to help paul finish college

rose feels that she is being weighed down with all this responsibility of helping the family she told her aunt about her dream and her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by what she was doing for the family
roses trait would be that she is strong emotionaly i know this because even when she is stressed and sleepy she helped her sister when she needed it
one detail is that she is tried from work school and homework and she has to get ans essay done for a state compition
i think one trait of rose from the conversation with anna makes her seem like she really likes her dad and wants him to be there but understands that he has to make more money for the family i also think she is the one that is overwellmed with this essay and is stressed out
one trait that could describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is hardworking in paragraph eighteen her aunt says do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family this shows that rose is working extremely hard to help her family out financially

rose is a very caring person
one way to descibe rose would be scared because she dont like fighting and argueing with her mom or her aunt

rose cares deeply for her sister despite the hopelessness that she feels she tries to make her sister anna feel better about the situation when in line 12 she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college despite her internal struggle rose pretends that things will work out to give her sister a sense of hope

1rose is caring because she is trying her best to help support paul in college
rose is a very stressful person she always has something on her mind and something that is always causing her to veer off her own path to help others
rose trys to act that every thing is ok when around her sister to make sure her sister dosent worry for example when rose realized she was over worked and had to finish her essay and anna walked in and saw the look she had on her face and asked if everything was fine and she replied that she just had a bad dream
rose can be descirbed as hopeful she believes in her brothers abilities and she also is hopeful that her papa did what was best for them even if the situation upsets her
i think rose is sincere to what she does but when she has to work or has to do an 3000 word essay she gets overwhelmed and doesnt know what to do

when she has something in her head shes going to do it she cares a lot about everything in her life
rose seems very caring and compassionate toward others when she is talking with anna she says its only been four months he had to go she says this to try to comfort her sister who is upset about papa leaving
she is hard working and doesnt give up on anything easily she is going to work after school and then is going home to help with the dinner
when she was talking to anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesnt have is confidence confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself i think she is very busy with her life and doesnt have time for herself or atleast doesnt make time for herself it seems like she is missing some things in her life that she needs at that point in time im so lonesome for papa it seems like hes been gone for years paragraph 9
that anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done but most the problems she is having is that she cant half of them done so through out this whole story anna is trying to found a way to do this
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab would be troubled you know this because she feels weighed down i know this because she agrees but doestnt tell aunt kolab about being weighed down
rose seems very overwhelmed when she is talking to her sister she gets very aggravated and storms out of the kitchen
rose is very loving because she works hard to try to help her brother get into a good college and would do anything for him even if it ends up hurting herself
rose is fearful of letting her family down aunt kolab saying do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family shows how much rose is afraid
one trait that could describe rose is that she has alot of flashbacks and emotional problems another that could also describe her is determinded because she wants to get this done and she stayes up all night trying to write this threehundred word essay that she will say and she fell asleep writting it so i find that she is very determind about the situation and the essay that she must write
rose is overwhelmed because she feels like she has to do everything rose has to work at the restaurant for a four hour shift then help her aunt prepare a quick supper afterwards she has write her three thousand word essay
rose is a strong person when anna says she is lonesome for papa rose says its only been four months and he had to take that job in los angeles
one trait that can desribe rose is that is is difficult because rose grew up here like when she said this must be difficult for you yes
rose is very hard working and caring  she believes that when you help someone they will help you in return  when rose is having a conversation with her sister anna rose states we have our part to do to help paul finish college  then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college       rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has  she is a very dedicated lady who seems to find success in a lot of different situations throughout her life
rose is very stressed out from haveing to do so much it says from school shed gone straight to work for four hours then home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper and then do a three thousand word essay
rose has taken on a adultlike responsibility this is evident when anna says to her you sound just like mama this trait could be described as she was growing up too fast she was not the typical teen that people would think of in the world the best example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like this shows that she is busy with helping this fact is shown when she talks to her aunt in the end when it talks about her being weighed down because she is helping her family
rose wants to help her family out because of the hard time they are going through she is what you call it a people pleaser and she wants to help out and win the essay contest to help out her family
rose is considerate she is stressed out and feels like there is too much responsibility on her but knows the family needs help when aunt kolab asks her if she felt weighted down by helping the family she doesnt respond because she wants to help she just doesnt know how much she can
rose is a very hard working person she has many tasks to do in one day including school help around the hose supper work at the restaurant homework and her essay
rose feels overwhelmed with all of her responsibilites however she is very understanding about what she needs to do to help her family she displays this understanding attribute when she cups her hands and thinks to herself that her brothers fate lies partly in her hands
resourceful suddenly it occurred to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague
i believe that rose has traits like a mother would have when she is talking to her sister anna rose takes care of her rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed when rose is talking to aunt kolab it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working
rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night she immediately asked if anything was alright
guilty would describe rose because in paragraph 19 rose was afraid to tell aunt kolab because the dosent want to hurt her aunt and she also thought that her aunt would tell her mother so rose just kept it to herself
rose is a hard worker  we do not know how old she is but by the description i would say shes in her teens  though at a young age she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork
rose wants to please everybody when shes talking to anna she talks about how they have to do their job to help their brother paul finish college so he can get a good job
she feels like a burden rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easiermaybe it wouldnt
rose sounds very responsible she has a lot of responsibilities and she is still concerned about school work and other important things in her life
rose can be described as overwhelmed she is noted quite a few times through out the story as being overly busy
she belives that money is everything she feels that she and everyone else has to pay for her brother than he will get a job and have to pay for his two siters to go to school
rose is very hardworking this is demonstrated by the fact that she works a job in addition to her schoolwork and also competes in other areas like the essaywriting contest teh fact that she can manage all of those activities at all even if they do leave her exhausted is proof of her hardworking character
there is one trait that can be picked up from the two conversations in the story rose wants to help her mom and her aunt but she has alot on her mind for instance when she was talking about writting the essay and she saidwhen woud she have time to write a flawless three thousand word essay
she is willing to heklp her brother work his way to college she tries her best to do what she can
the anna told rose head jerked up from her chestanna what wrong you feel okay that what anna told rose
rose is angry she has to work and school work at the same time and she just cant take it much longer
anna knows that no matter how stressful everything is on her she needs to continue to reassure her sister and let her know that everything will be ok  when anna asks about their father rose says its only been four months he had to go  the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
confused i think she wonders why her father would choose to go so far away just for a job and she wonders why her aunt is doing what shes doing to help their family
i do not know
rose seems to not talk a lot she just nods when her aunt tells her something
rose is a very busy personit said that her aunt offer had somehow made her feel lighter it made the weight on her shoulders lighten up a bit
one way to describe rose would be respectful because through out the whole story rose never talks back to aunt kolab
one trait i can think of would be unsure of herself she seems to be unsure if she can help out her family like the others like she questions whether or not she is capableshe feels as though she would be a let down if she was not able to help out one detail would be when her aunt ask her  do you feel so weighed down by waht youre doing to help this family she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt
i think that rose is open minded because she could be like her sister and be bitter and angery but even when she talks to her aunt and sister she still concidered about her family because her sister at the table is telling her theres no hope for their family
with rose having school work chores and homework i would say that she is strong rose has a converstation with anna talikng about their papa and even though rose doesnt like the situation any better she trys to stay positive
in crossing over the author displays rose as a helpful child but one who keeps her feelings inside although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done for example as she was speaking to her sister she explained how they needed to help paul finish collegeand hell pay for her and anna to go to collegeparagraph 11 sentence 34 not once does rose express her worry about the situation
as is widely known people do not always show their true emotions for a multitude of resons even though her feelings told her otherwise during her conversation with anna rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their familys situation rather than be thoroughly honest then when speaking to her aunt rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family what rose has done being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character
muted noises aunt kolab making muted noises in the kitchen
lonely mamas not home yet is she i hate how late she has to work

rose doesnt want to tell her aunt how she really feels at first because she doesnt want to hurt her or have her aunt tell her mother so one trait would ne that she is matureshe takes care of her little sister while her mother works long nights
aunt kolab cares about anna and she knows when something is wrong with her anna rose said whats wrong you feel okay
from reading this story i have come to find that rose is a selfcentered person when young anna came into the kitchen and told rose that she had had a nightmare rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying i fell asleep working on an essay without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling
the trait is that rose kept an open mind during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay which pretty much worked out in the long run
in both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress rosa feels she almost cant go on because of the fact her fathers gone and shes left to work rosa feels that she is too young for so much responsibility
rose can be optimisticrose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldnt
anna rose said whats wrong you feel okay it shows that she is caring
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab could be that she is a very family person she wishes to make people happy and try her best to keep the family togather
rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else in her conversation with her little sister anna rose feels overwelmed but she doesnt let her sister know and she even tries to compfort her when anna complains about their mother not being home and their father being away rose explains to her little sister why things are how they are in a gentle way this shows compation and caring
rose was cautious she didnt want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her one passage in the story that would support this conclusion is rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
one trait rose shows is caring the reader can see this in the 19th  paragraph because rose doesnt want to tell her aunt kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings

rose can be described as consoling  in her conversation with anna rose attempts to make sense of the familys load to anna who is distraught and doesnt quite understand the whole situation  she justifies their helping paul with college by telling her how hell be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job  rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood
rose cares because in thestory of crossing over she trys to help with the money but the three thoundsword essay was messing with her
that she is always worried
one trait is caring it can be seen when rose was asks her sister anna whats wrong this shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister
rose while feeling overwhelmed tried to be optimistic in most situations she feels like she has to be a role model for anna if rose expresses her true feelings then she is afraid that anna will lose faith in their situation as well in paragraph 11 rose explains with a maternal tone how her and anna have to appreciate what paul is doing for them he is going to school so he can get a job and ultimately help pay for the sisters college funds rose tries to point out the importance in helping out paul rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up how she is tired of working so much and how school is constantly weighing down on her despite these feelings rose tries to remain positive for annas sake and holds her tongue
rosa coul be feeling a little hust at the dream she had she told anna that im fine i just had another bad dream
in this story the character of rose is in a tough situation her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her as a result when she is talking to her sister anna you see you get a little angry this is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling you can see this when she resonds to anna saying money isnt everthing with only if you already have everthing this is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure rose is feeling to not only finish her essay but to also make money for her family

guilty rosa didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
she wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing
from paragraph 19 i could tell that rose is a very modest person i got the feeling that she doesnt like to bother people she even says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone

rose is a young girl having to squeeze in time for her school work while she has a job and also a younger sibling to take care of even though she had many things to do she still is caring for her family and is willing to do it all for them

she was afaird she was afaird to tell her aunt the truth
rose is brave in the sense that she doesnt want her sister to know how she really feels rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh she didnt want her sister to worry about her so rose was brave

she is responsiable she was nervouse because she didnt want to mess up her brothers chance to graduate from collage
rose feels conficted by how she believes that no one really understands what she is going through one detail is in her dreams she sees all  the things that is going on and it frustrates her so much that she feels that she cannot do anything about it
helpful paul fate lies in partly in these
one character trait that describes rose is thoughtfulness     rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
she tries to help her sister out cause their dad is gone but her sister is mad that their mom has to work so late and she isnt home yet she can also help out her aunt kolab with the things she needs so she has a helping trait
rose is stressed and scared that is why she does not tell the truth to her aunt at first because she does not want to hurt her or her mother
one trait of rose is that she is a hard worker  you can tell that she is a hard worker due to the fact that she has schooling then has to work a fourhour shift and after that has to come home to help with dinner and do her homework  with all of what she does for her family she never gives up nore dose she ever take a break
one trait that rose has is responseability and this is shown by the statement do you feel so weighted down by what youre doing to help the family this statement was made by aunt kolab in response to roses dream this shows that rose has felt the burden of responseability and is trying her best to maintain and finish through on what her family asks and what she wants to achieve
rose is a fearful or stressed being she wants to help her famliy however she feels as if she does not have enough time or patience to do everthing rose feels pressured and this trait of feeling pressured is exposed through a dream his body sank as if it were made of stone pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom pauls body wrighting her down represents all of the tasks she needs to do she has too much going on
rose is a sympathetic person she does not like hurting other people in paragraph 19 it says rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
she is very down to earth and knows that her mom has to do what she has to do when she says money isnt everything
anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table
rose is a hardworker and will do anything to keep her family up and running  thus when she defended what her family was doing to stay afloat to her sister she proved that she knows whats best for her family and will do anything to help them prove it
one trait that best decribes rose is that she keeps to herself meaning that she holds her feelings inside and does not share with anyone rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probaby tell her mother this is and example from the story as to the trait i described
she felt weighed down or sad
she is confused and busy with her life is right now rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her
this story shows that rose is a mentally strong girl  the story shows this trait in her when rose says to anna we have our part to do to help paul finish college  this sentence shows that rose is a mentally strong because eventhough she is younger that paul she still has to help him finish college  rose also has school work and family obligations that she has to take care of too
i think that rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself she worries about other people i think this because when she was talking to anna in the kitchen she says anna whats wrong do you feel okay i think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though shes worried about her essay she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay
i think rose is very hardworking cause she says we have our part to do do help paul finish for college i think it shows that rose works hard even if she doesnt enjoy doing the work
one trait that i think describes rose is mature i think this because when she was talking to her sister anna she stood up for her father who moved to los angeles she looks at things from other peoples perspectives which makes her very mature
mad
rose is very tired and overworked  from school shed gne straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper  after that it was time to do homework
1 i belive that rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with anna she comforted anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice
she was talking to anna and said he had to go los angeles paid three times what he was making hereanna glared at rose money isnt everythingthat she was under stress and her mother was working late
rose is very closeminded shes so used to things in america that she didnt realize that what shes doing to help her family was also done in cambodia her familys native country     her aunt tells her in cambodia our first country what were all doing would be quite normal but now i realize that youre seeing the situation through other eyes as you should i suppose because you grew up here this must be difficult for you yes to show that rose is indeed weighted by her efforts to help her brother paul graduate from college and also to help her family in other ways as well such as helping her aunt kolab with making supper and helping anna cope with bad dreams
that rose knows wgat is going on with her family
rose wants to help the family as much as possible but she does not want to up set her mother or aunt in paragragh 19 she says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
she is a person who thinks bout every thing even if it is a old thought like ther dream she had how she remembered him jumpin off the rock and sank like a rock and had her pinned to the ground and didnt even realize it
hard headed but open minded at the same time
rose is a person who tries to please everyone this trait is clearly shown when she does not answer her aunt when she asks rose about feeling weighed down
while talking to anna rose shows that she has a short temper when she rolls her eyes and then she stood and stalked out of the kitchen
when she is quiet she seems self concious
rose comes off to be a an impatient person its not her sisters fault that she has to write such a long essay she gets an attitude with her sister her voice sank to a fierce whisper
one trait is the fact that she doesnt want to hurt her family no matter the reason so she decides to lie in paragraph 19 she puts this theory into effect
rose can be described by the the word caring she shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and anna when she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care for example she sayswhats wrong you feel okay
rose is very turthful sometimes also she keeps almost everything in how she was turthful she told her aunt about her dream also she kept in about how she felt about the work load
rose is caring and doesnt like to upset others when she was talking to her aunt it said rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother which shows that she doesnt want to see her aunt get hurt
i believe that rose had the trait to endure not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay she also has the patients to endure even the negative moments that her sister often feels due to the situation they are in
rose doesnt think that her life will never get alittle easier unless her parents and her aunt had someway to make her feel lighter then always being busy camdodian tradition and snese of family she realized could survive an ocean corssing
she is a very caring person and she always wants to help out she always trys to be nice
rose seems like she does alot to help her family and it is hard on her because shes still young shes a strong person and would most likely do everything she could to help her family rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt and now she feels like things might get easier
rose the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and downtoearth while many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time an example of roses groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister instead of comforting anna when she talked about missing thier father rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college
rose is open minded the support is when aunt kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies or even make special treats from their country and sell them rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head
one trait rose has is that she can make the best out of anything although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother her aunt helps to brighten her day saying that maybe she could help rose out not only did this make rose feel better but she also used it as inspiration for her essay and realized that her life really wasnt all that bad
rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job when she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to anna about how she feels she says that she misses him and says money isnt everything because thats why he went to get more money for the family rose doesnt understand that so she is very upset about him leaving
rose is a very caring person she would not tell her aunt kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt
i think that rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do like in the story her aunt said this must be difficult for you yes rose nodded that rite there is what tells me that rose feels responsible
she feels stressed like she cant do what she wants to do she feels as though she must do what is best for the family therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest an example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy but having to travel to sacramento she said that she couldnt go because shed missed too many shifts and she needed her job
one trait that describes rose is tired exhausted i feel asleep working on my essay rose said
anna feels sorry for her dad cause her mom works way to much
 its like she wants to keep her true feelings insideand have her two family members thinking everything is okay detail from storyrose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
to me it sounds like rose helps provide for her family which tells that she is responsible when she is talking to her aunt kolab her aunt asks do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family that tells me she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on and doesnt have time for herself such as the essay
she worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now she talked to anna about they had a part to do so that they could go to college aunt kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do rose said that she does worry about it
she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around because how she said i hate how late she has to work and also when she said im so lonesome for papa
one trait that can describe rosa based on her converstions with aunt kolab is exausted because she has alot on her shoulders between working school and other activities such as the three thousand word essay for a competition
rose has identified her self as stressed durring both conversations rose seems to be hiding it when roses aunt began speaking she noticed roses face do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
based on the conversation rose had with anna i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lostthe reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for himbut she doesnt really know if thats really true
rose is a loving caring and very family orientated
she is a hard worker she always helps her aunt and mom out she also makes sure her homework is done and wants to do an essay
that their father left to make more money
in the story crossing over the character rose is very hard working when rose is talking to her younger sister anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay another thing rose says while talking to her sister is that we have to do our part to help paul the older brother finish college later in the story she is talking to her aunt and her aunt says to her do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family these example show that rose is a very hard worker
she shows compasion whe she was talking to her aunt kolab she knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question so she did not say anything
she feels like she isnt ready to have someone elses fate in her hands  when she talked to aunt kolab she didnt talk but she did agree that she felt weighted down by all the responsobility and soon after was grateful that she had talked about it
rose worries alot
i brlieve that rose is sad she is moping around she is having nightmares she feels like the wolrd is resting on her shoulders
i believe strength describes rose she is trying to hold her family together and we see this during her conversation with anna
rose is strong even though she has to work at the restaurant and go to school she tries to push forward for her family
from reading the passage one of roses traits would probably be confusion or exhaustion from the essay
rose is very stressed girl she has so much to do in so little time she has to do that paper and also put someone through school then have time to go to school herself
rose is lonely she says im so lonesome for papa it seems like hes been gone for years
rose is a helpful kind loving sister this trait of love can be seen when rose says we have our part to do to help paul finish collegethis statement shows the maturity of rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother by keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night
rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family when anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around rose attempts to lighten the situation and make anna feel better she makes a joke saying that money isnt everything as long as you already have everything rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does an example of this is when she tells anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future
shes caring by listening to her sister and trying to cheer her up even though she failed at it and also thinks about her aunt and her home country of cambodia as something to write for her essay
sincere    rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
rose is a very selfless from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper
rose is a quite girl it saids that rose didnt answer or she just nodded
when rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money rose cant get anna to understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to make more money when rose talks to her aunt she feels the same way as rose does they both understand that the family needs money her aunt says that it was the same way in the other country they both have the same trait just different arguments
rose is very humble at first rose dislikes all the responsibility that is put on her then she realizes that paul has the fate of two people in his hands rose only has to take care of herself for now she appreciates the fact that paul will care for her and her sister
she has a way with finding topics for her essayssuddeenly it all occured to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague
caringshe cares because she didnt want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunts feelings
rose seems very caring when her sister anna wakes up and she is talking to rose about how their dad had to go to los angeles for a job and rose comforted anna even though she was upset as well
rose cares about her family more than anything
one trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasnt there i think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing her mom works late and so that must mean that rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time
rose is a lonely person
rose cares for her family not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt  she also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away
rose feels as if she has to work work work to help her family it seems she cant enjoy herself or write her essay in the story it says pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her
one trait that can describe rose is her driving need to succeed and help her family in any way she can the fact that she is trying so hard to help her aunt and wanting to keep her little sisters spirits up
one trait of rose based on her conversations with aunt kolab is that she is tired of being so busy and would like some time to live rose said that she feels too young for so much responsibility she told aunt kolab and she understood seeing that she would see what she could do to take some stress off of roses shoulders
she wasnt really in to the conversation she just kept nodding her head to show that she understood what her aunt was trying to say
she is optimistic she tells anna that when paul finnishes college he will help pay for her and her sister to go to college
rose is exhausted and hard working but also quit aunt kolab asked her if she felt weighted down even though she does she didnt admit that she did
one trait that describes rose is hopeful even though she has to work go to school cook and try to write an essay she still has hope that her life is going to get better this is shown when rose is talking to her aunt kolab maybe i can sew for ladies or i could make special treats from our country and sell them this sentence shows how she is going to make an effort to make her life better she is also hopeful by coming up with an essay topic to write about and maybe should could win the writing contest
rose could be described as lazy because she doesnt want to work
rose knows she has to get the essay done and ann i will ing to help
she is easily stressed out to the point where thinking clearlly is near impossible the dream that she had was symbolic because paul weighed her down just like stress weighed her thoughts also paul has recieved his diploma and so she may feel pressured to reach up at education just as he did but the essay unresolved burdens her mind
rose is very difiant in the story its almost like she is looking for attention rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose i5t so it would loosen the grip on her after she had finished her aunt said with a puzzled look do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
rose is a very understanding person she understands that in order to live a life somewhere new there will be changes that they all will have to make she knows that they cannot all have everything they want but in order to have somethings they have to make some sacrifices     while rose is talking with anna she explains to her that their father getting a job in los angeles was something he had to do for their family although none of them like the fact their father is away so much it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want
rose is a very responsible person because she tries to do all that she can to help out her family  she tries to suppress how she is really feeling inside in order to avoid conflict
rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is that she is a grateful person when aunt kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell rose felt better in crossing over it says but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter that signifies that rose truely did appriciate what aunt kolab was willing to do to help her out
rose is responsibility because she said she felt too young for so much respnsibilt
one of roses main traits in the story is her selfless determination when she says we have our part to do to help paul pay for college she shows how helpful she is to her brother
she is hardworking because she balances schoolwork and works a 4hour shift at her job
rose is shy rose shows this when she is talking to anna rose does not say much but finally looses patience with anna also when rose talks to aunt kolab she does not say much either just keeping her thoughts to herself and nodding
one trait to describe rose would be optimistic after annas bad dream rose tries to help anna see their father moving away as a positive thing rose also attempts to help anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job
one quality to describe rose based on her conversation with anna would be she is responsible rose said we have our part to do to help paul finish college she has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister rose feels pressure from her duties to the family but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first
rose is a very responsible and respectful person in paragraph 2 she was responsible for supporting her family working and doing school work rose is very respectful to her aunt kolab because as it shows in paragraph 12 sshe does not want to hurt her
based on the conversation with anna you can tell rose is sincere she hid her true feelings in order to try to comfort her little sister
rose is careless of othersin her conversation with anna she was talking as if money were everything and she was rolling her eyes at annarose said they have to do their part and help paul through college so he will pay for them to go to college when its their turn to go
rose is a independent teenaged girl with alot on her plate from school she goes straight to her job at a resturant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help her aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework she feels overlwhemlmed with the familys focus on her brother paul she dont want to wait on him to take care of her and their family she wants to make moves on her own
rose is a responsible person  she knows that she has a role in her family  she does everything she needs to do to make her familys plan go smoothly  she does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college  in a way she is responsible for her future  if she helps pay for her brothers college now he will help pay for hers when it is time  she never complains and is responsible for her role in the family
in the passage rose says we have our part to do to help paul finish college  she says this to her little sister anna as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money  this statement by rose expresses her work ethic  it shows that she is hardworking and that it is important to her as well as the rest of her family to work hard to support one another
i think that rose is catious of other peoples feelings she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings by saying yesdo you feel weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
anna
rose is selfish in the story when rose and anna were talking rose was saying how there papa was away in las angelas for 4 months but she really didnt care cause the job payed better anna got upset and said money wasnt everything to her
she feels like everything is hard for her her essay her job moving from a different country it would be hard for her she feels suppressed from pauls achievements because he has graduated from high school and is getting worried because her family doesnt have alot of money for school
rose
rosa feels like her brother is bringing her down she also feels like she is responsible for her brother in a way  a part in the story is when she says pauls fate lies partly in these  she talking about her hands  she is saying that she is going to have to work for him so they can have a good life
roses trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing she doesnt believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that
rose is uptight  this is apparent when she dreams of paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what shes doing for the family
thoughtful when aunt kolab asked do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt aunt kolab and her mothers feelings if she had answered the question also rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with anna about her father working so far away
rose is loving and cares for her familybut she is scared and lonely rose is scared f being lonely and misses her family very much rose expresses her feelings of loneliness
rose had a essay to write and she was getting a additude with them all rolling her eyes throughing the chair and more she wanted to stay with her aunt kolaband her aunts face lit up because she wanted her niece to stay with her and start over
rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than anna and realistic about thier situation i know this because when anna says money isnt everything she replies saying that it isnt if you already have everything
rose is doubtful especially by her sarcastic remarks towardher sister anna sayingonly if you already have everything
rose she has a lot on her plate she has to work and go to school plus has to watch her sister anna plus rose seems to be a dreamer  she has a lot of bad dreams everything is hard for both her and anna
rose is very considerate of her family when talking to aunt kolab she shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesnt not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt
one trait that describes rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings i think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didnt want to hurt her
rose seems to be reserved shes more to herself she wont talk about her feelings to others at the end of the story aunt kolab was asking rose about how she felt about the family she asked do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose didnt answer to her aunt kolab she just simply nodded
thoughtful because she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she didnt want to hurt her mother
they both like helping people
rose is very dedicated to what she does she has school homework and a fourhour shift and still finds time to write a 3 thousand word essay
rose puts her family before herself this can be seen when she is talking to anna and insists that they must work hard to put their brother through college
a trait that rose has is the ability to suppress her problems and to reassure others
she is very stressed when rose talks to anna about working on the essay so hard that she fell asleep doing it
in the conversations that rose has with anna and aunt kolab rose comes off as determined she is determined to graduate just like her brother paul did shes determined to help her family out as much as possible with her father gone in los angeles
she is a very busy person in the story  she is constantlydoing something to help wether it be school or family  from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to hel aunt kolab prepare a quick supper  after that it was time to do homework paragraph 2
rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger
she is caring and wants to be as kind as possible an example was when the story said its only been four months rose said as gently as she could she was obviously trying to be nice to her sister
a trait that rose showed when she was talking to anna was that she can be sarcastic she shows that when anna said money isnt everything and rose responded with only if you already have everything
rose is caring when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family does not tell her that she is she does this to save her aunts and mothers feeling so they are not dissapointed in her
rose is upset because her mother is always working she feels that it is her job to watch out for her sister and little brother
she is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay when would she squeeze in writing a flawless threethousandword essay
one trait that rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people she is very stressed concerning her familys situation yet she still manages to keep going her talks with aunt kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has thus she finds a topic for her essay making her feel better
one trait that describes rose would be stressed in the story she has to work at a resturant help her aunt with supper and do homework the story also tells me that she would have to squeeze in writing a paper telling me that she is pushed for time showing that she is stressed
determined because she just knows that paul will finish college and make enough money so that both of the girls will also be able to go to college  even though anna doesnt think that this will happen rose knows it will happen
rosa told her aunt kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it her aunt understood completly and trird to help rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help rose not feel this way
i would describe anna as a very hard worker she goes to school on a daily basis after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant when she gets off work anna rushes home to help her aunt kolab prepare a quick supper and then she does her homework anna has to juggle school work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker
i think roses most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility but instead of going into how hard her life is she notes on how much harder pauls life was this also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others
what is only one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab the one and only trait that i think could describe rose is motivation i think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things in paragraph 22 line 1hmm maybe we can find a way to do things differntly i also think that this shows her character is a very driven person
one trait rose has in this passage was that she said that money isnt everthing meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till papa gets back from his job in los angeles
one of the traits that rose has based on her conversation with her aunt kalob shes someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right and go better an example of this is that she goes to school and has a job right after school leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself but she wants ans needs to help her family out
a trait that i believe would describe rose best would be persistant even though she has to work a job help around the house and has the pressure on her to go to college she still goes on with life and does the best she can during her conversation with anna rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in cambodia but rose also hides how she really feels and even though she does not like the weight she must carry she still moves on during her conversation with aunt kolab rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for rose
one trait of rose would be that she is hard working this i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab she has all these thing to do its like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her although she is still young she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family and thats deffeniatly a hard worker
rose felt that she did a lot for the family she felt too stressed rose did a lot she balanced having a job school helping take care of her sister and family  she felt weighed down also  an example of this was when roses aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family  rose did not answer her because she didnt want her family to feel bad she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother  she didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything  even at the end of the story roses aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help roses stress level
she was sincere one way this is shown in the story is if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose has a sense of humor she says only if you already have everything to express this humor although she does not feel like the happiness behind it is real
she is very protective of her family she wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out she has a strong sense of duty you can see this by how she goes straight from school to work a long shift to help her aunt make dinner
rose can be described as selfless she puts the needs of her family first she risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family her aunt kolab hints at it when she asks rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but rose doesnt respond
one trait that i can see in rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldnt be able to travel to sacramento if she won the essay prize
rose can quickly see the better things that can come out of the situations she is living in this shows that rose has a good attitude on life and when she is down she can become happy very quickly
i think rose is very caring  it seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family even though it can be very stressful at times  i think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed
she is considerate paragraph 19 rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would  hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
shes a caring person
rose doesnt want to hurt anyones feelings by saying how she feels  she didnt want to hurt her sister or her aunt in the story it says rose didnt answer  if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family the storys states that she has a job tries hard in school and tries to help her sister as much as she can it seems the father will be gone for a long period of time as will the brother one for work and the other for school so it seems rose may have to step up and help out
thinks she knows everythingshe ignores anna
rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep this shows that rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake but her mother was not awake to help so rose continued to keep to herself
rose cares very deeply about others she tries to comfort others and would do anything for them in her conversation with anna rose sees that her younger sister is upset rose tries to comfort anna and tells her that even though things are tough now they will get better

one trait that can describe rose is responsible rose works to help support her family and takes responsibility in comforting her younger sister anna by telling her that they have a part to do to help their family
i think one thing that could have been a trait was that maybe she was respectful and a good listener for example the author said suddenly it occurred to her here was her topic so that meant that she listened to her aunt while she talked

when rose was talking to her sister anna in the kitchen an she was mad rose kept giving her positive feedback i think thatswhat the oldest child should always do i dont think thats howshe really felt but thats what anna needed to hear
rose is respectful of her relitives feelings because in paragraph 19 it said she didnt answer because if she told the truth it might hurt her aunts feelings
i think rose is caring but she is just too pressured to stay focused and do what she wants to do you know she cares by her still trying to write a threethousandword essay when she has school and a job to concentrate on for her to put that much work in for her family shows she cares a lot about them
rose is overwhelmed with work she feels what her family is going through and is trying to help but is scared she has to go to school then go to work and on top of that she has to do homework and help take care of her family
rose is a positive person who tries and reassures her sister as much as possible she really cares about her family and tries to take her responsibilities maturely we can see this in her conversation with anna when anna is complaining about her father going off to work rose reassures her by saying that its only been 4 months then she continues saying we have our part to do to help paul finish college we can see that she cares about her brother and is positive about the work she must endure to help him succeed

selfish  the job at the los angeled paid three times what he was making there
rose is a helpful person  in the story she is always trying to find a way to help her family
rose can be best descirbed as caregiving person i think that she cares for her dad and she misses him and wants him to come homei also think she is more like a day dreamer she think alot about the past and she like to imagine things or have flash backs of good moments
anna glared at rosemoney isnt everythingaunt said with a puzzled lookyoure doing to help this family
caring
she was told that she is just like her mom
caring if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
she works hard for something that she wants like the competition but she does not forget about her other duties like home workthe essey proves my point she was working hard for it yet she still did her work shifts
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with aunt kolab is that she still has growing up to do even though she has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders she is still young she still has a lot of learning ahead of her rose needs someone to talk to when she has a conflict in her life you can see this trait in the conversation with rose and aunt kolab

rose is caring she seems concerned when anna walks in and she asks anna if she feels okay
she is positive even though she is feeling the same way and like she has to do all the work she still kept a positive attitude she faked it to make her sister feel better for example she talked about how paul is going to finish college then pay for them to get good jobs she was saying that they wouldnt have to suffer for too long
rose seems to be a really stressed out kid the passage supports that with many things but i think a really good example of it would be the conversation she had with her aunt
she is worried about the responsibility she has to take on rose felt too young for so much responsibility
i could use many words to describe this young cambodian girl named rose shes helpful caring smart gracious and very reseponsible but i believe that the word that suites her the most is mature     rose is very mature she is handling her situation quite well shes not going around and complaining about how much she has on her plate shes trying her best to keep a positive view on things she works a fourhour shift at a restaurant goes to school and still helps out with household chores like helping her aunt kolab prepare dinner     shes a young adult and has a very high level of maturity for tackling all her tasks and being a strong role model for her younger sister anna thats why i would describe rose as mature
caring rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
rose seems to be held back by her family as she expressed to aunt kolab
from the story you can tell that rose is a very heartwarming person she cares about her family and respects their different cultures that they may have rose was always a positive person even when her and her sister anna would get into it she would always stay positive
caring     rose said we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
rose is a responsible young girl she is also hardworking one detail from the story that supports this assumption is the following excerpt from school shed gone straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homeworkrose had a lot of responsibilities that she managed without becoming completely stressed out
rose doesnt like to hurt peoples feeling you can tell because when her aunt asked if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family she knew how she felt she just didnt want to tell her aunt the truth because she didnt want her to be upset
that you can do anything you want in your life
rose is a very suddle or respectful person because she kept some of her feelings inside of her or didnt tell anyone how she felt fot a while and no matter what she was bound to keep working to keeep her family good doing whatever it took
i can tell from this passage that rose is a very generous person throughout the entire passage she talks about how she is stressed out and under much pressure but she keeps doing it all to help paul get through college a very specific part to show this is at the very beginning whenever she wakes up from dozing off when trying to do her homework after that part she talks about why she is tired because she goes to school works and then has to help around her house and try to keep up with homework and she continues doing all those things to help someone else
their conversations were good they always would talk about the good
a trait that could describe rose based on her conversation with anna is frustrated i feel this way because sh is very upset about the familys situation and the amount of importance she is right now in their lives
one trait that anna has is the need to please people anna has the type of personality that everything needs to be fixed and corrected by her for example she places alot of stress upon herself to fix the families issues but in the end all that occurs is a feeling of heavy weight is placed on her by her family paragraph 18
one trait that describes rose is that she is responsible  for example she goes to school work and makes dinner  she is a responsible girl and tries to take care of the family
rose feels like she has to carry the weight of the whole family because her brother and father were out of the house rose had a dream that she was swimming in a lake and suddenly she looked up and her brother jumped in his body was weighing her down but it seemed like he didnt notice
in the story rose is the main character this main character displays kindness it can be easily noticed in the conversation  that she has with aunt kolab when they are talking rose suppresses her feelings she is under the impression that she may offend her aunt so she does not mention how she really feels these traits show that rose tries to be kind even when she is under quite a lot of stress
1 rose is selfless because she is willing to do something for her family that she does not want to do and she does not want to let aunt kolab know how she feels because she thinks it might hurt her aunt
they lost one of there family members and they are upset about it and she keeps dreaming about it and all they want it to be happy and all they think about is that family member that passed away
i think the trait that can be used to describe rose is she is busy with everything in school her job and helping with the house she wa stired from writing her essay
she does a lot for her family she defends her father when anna says he has been gone too long she says they all have their own part to do to help their dad finish college she suggests to her aunt kolab that she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family
in the end rose is able to show her feelings and not keep them inside she is under a lot of stress and has a dream about paul weighing down on her body she confesses to her aunt that it is difficult for her to help the family out as much as she does after she talks with her aunt rose feels relieved and lighter
rose could be described as protective in her conversation with anna she insincerely laughs after she states that money isnt everything only if you already have everything in order to hide the depth of the familys struggles as well as the weight upon her own shoulders from anna
this story is discribing that rose is letting her work control her attitude when she talks to anna ignores her sisters bad dream

she is loyal but cannot live the way she is expected to at the beginning of the story she was upset that she had fallen asleep and failed one of her tasks this shows that she sincerely wanted to get the task done
when rose was talking to anna she flet kind of like she was being amused then when anna glared at rose and said that money isnt eerything she was really upset when her gradfather went to los angeles for a job there

conflicted rose knows that she has to work at her job and make money to support paul at college yet she has her own dreams and she has an essay to write which she could win a prize for but she needs to keep working and to accept the prize you need to go to sacramento but if she does her boss will fire her and she wont be able to work for support
a trait that rose has is she is put under a lot of pressure and is stressed easily with her family conflicts and juggling everything that is occuring in her life he aunt asks her do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose is timid and does not tell her the truth and this displays that she is stressed
she is independent i say this because in the article she has to take care of her sister and she already has a job

rose talked to anna in a sencer loving way  anna rose said whats wrong you feel ok
a trait would be hoping for the better she tried a laugh that sounded even fake to her
when rose was talking to aunt kolab she did not speak it was almost as if she was scared or afraid to hurt her aunts feelings she did feel almost exactly how her aunt was suggesting and she was to nervous to tell her when her aunt offered to help out more by making some special treats or sewing for ladies rose felt as if a heavy weight was taken off of her shoulders and she became less stressed
she doesnt want to listen to what antone has to say about what they have to do to make ends meet in paragraph 11 rose is telling anna that they have to help paul finish colledge by workin and in paragraph 12 anna says u sound just like mamma and stormed out of the room
rose is a character of many traits  one that is revealed in her conversation with anna is her compassion for doing things they way they should be done  she understands that paul is in college and needs help  she also understands that when she gets in college she will also need help too  her head is on straight and she can see reality instead of what she wants to see
she think about other people than herself maybe we can find a way to do tings differently a better way for you

rose is very stressed about helping her family for she feels overwhelmed but at the same time she doesnt want to tell her aunt kolab that she is feeling stressed because she knows that aunt kolab will most likely be hurt by the information this proves that rose is thoughtful of other peoples feelings and caring even when she doesnt feel well herself
rose is a careing person becuse she says whats rong you feel ok this tells that she cares for her sister becuse she could of not said eny thing and she wouldent know what her sisters thinking about
she is caring because when her aunt kolab ask her questions about if she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family rose didnt want to answer because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or mother
she needs an answer to her question and she wants her opinion
one trait rose has is self absorbition in her talk with anna she takes in all of the pain that her dad isnt  home and tries to keep it away from anna
i think roses trait is that she has a lot to do with the family she tries everything just to make the family happy she is kind of like the mother she has quite a bit of responsibility                     an example from the story would be when rose said from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper
one trait that can descibe rose is that she is hardworking the story says that she came home from school and went straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift and then straight home to help with supper she also had to do her homework rose was a hardworker and had dedication she had to have dedication to do school work and help out her family rose may have had to do all these things but she did her best at all them to help her family and to make a better life for her and her family
rose is growing up too fast and having to take on responsibilities that she isnt used to  she has to act like more of an adult than she really is so that her sister doesnt have to worry  this is obvious when anna says you sound just like mama it shows that even if rose doesnt realize it she is becoming an adult
one trait the identifies rose is that she has alot of fate in believe her family will hopefully come out of debt sometime and will not have to worry about money anymore an example would be when she says that their dad had to go to los angoles for a new job so he could get paid more money and some day return at the same time their brother is going to college and once his finishes and gets a good job their dad and brother will help pay them two to go off to college
she loves money
one trait that can describe rose is trust she trusts her aunt enough to come to her and tell her whats wrong and it ends up giving her motivational help
rose is a strong induvidual because she does alot for her family and stays strong for them an example of this is in paragraph 11 sentences 2 and 3 she tried a laugh and that even sounded fake to her  we have our part to do to help paul finish college this shows that rose is trying to stay strong for anna and her family by supporting paul
the trait that i would give to rose during her conversation with anna is strength because rose is also upset about her father being away for four months but she decides not to get discouraged about it
one trait that can describe rose is open minded rose spends the whole time stressing about her essay and what she is going to do to support her family in paragragh 23 rose became more open minded when she began talking to aunt kolab about things she could do to be helpful to the family
rose is very responsible and she wants her family to stay together this is talked about in the story when she says that she needs to look at things through other peoples eyes also
rose is caring towards her sister she gives her sister anna a logical explanation as to why their father moved for work rather than complain about how much she misses him too in a way she is trying to comfort her sister and tell her that it is for the greater good of the family
she is caring she knows that paul needs to go to college to get a job so that he can pay them back but anne just thinks about it now although anne is right about money isnt everything
that she is always worried about her school work and nothing else when anna told her thath she had a bad dream all rose did was change the subject about the essay
rose is a caring person and this becomes evident when she askes anna if shes feeling okay after anna has had a bad dream
helpful
she wasnt very confident about what was gooing on with the essay and her dad
she is shelfish she only thought about herself and money maybe we can find a way to do things diferently a way better for you
hopeful     we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
i think that rose is sympathetic because when she was talking to her aunt kolab in the kitchen she doesnt come out and tell her aunt that she feels weighted down by what she does to help the family because she doesnt want to hurt her feelings
rose is a very hardworking young woman as her aunt had asked her do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family poor rose has had to work fourhour shifts on top of going to school in order to support her brother through college so that in return he can work and support rose and her sister come time for them to go to college
they both dont understand what rose  is trying to say
stressed in the 14th paragraph it says she felt too young for so much responsibility as she cupped her hands together thinking about her life situation
one trait that you could give rose is that she a hardworker because when she came to the essay and she didnt have anything to write about she didnt give up or put it off and not do the essay she continued to try to find a topic to write about
rosa is very motherly when anna walks in the room rosas first response is to ask whats wrong you feel okay this shows how she cares for her and her family
after reading the text anna is presented as being tied down or feeling suffocated she shows this throughout but she shows it when she wonders to herself when she would squeeze that essay inparagraph 3 sentence 1
she has too many emotions
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with aunt kolab is that she is hardworking she is so hardworking that aunt kolab notices it aunt kolab says during their converstion that maybe they can find a way that is better for rose one that will take so much stress off of her this shows that she must work hard for the family to keep it running it shows that rose is very hardworking
roses trait displayed in the story is that she is a very hard worker especially for her family  when she talks about her day is begins with from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then staight home to help aunt kelob prepare a quick supper
rose is caring in the way that she does not want to trouble others with her own conflicts  this is shown when rose doesnt answer aunt kolab when she says rose feels weighed down by trying help her family
that she is responsible because she helps her sister anna with her bad dream even though she didnt appreciate it
rose has a trait of protectiveness this is shown through her conversation with anna when she hides her emotions from anna this is an example of protectiveness because she is doing what is best for her by not showing that she is scared as well this will give anna a sense of comfort to think that someone is in control another example is when anna first walks in and the first thing rose does is ask if she is ok
rose is a very kind person  she asks how her sister feels and goes to her room to check on her
rose is perseverent she doesnt give up she works a fourhour shift after school and has to do homework too she knows that she has her families fate in her hands she knows that she cant give up
an the athour is right money doesnt buy happynest
she is extremely caring of others and does all she can for other people she also always puts herself last before others
rose has a trait that makes her seem to herself as helpless  this is a good trait because you can do more work when you have something that needs done although you do not know why  you feel helpless and so you do something that needs done without you really even knowing you did it  rose is talking to ana at the time that this trait exposes itself  it says she tried a laugh taht sounded fake even to her  this is trying to get her sister to no feel so bad about papa leaving to go  to los angeles  she is also trying to get her to know that it is their responsibility to support paul through college
rose is very stressed because of this essay she just needed to take her mind off of the essay in the end she wasnt thinking about the essay and her aunt helped her firgure out  title by not really even helping her
rose is very determind but she is also being wighed down by other things like the essay she is doing to help her family she is very determind to get the essay done and help her family and her brother
even though it doesnt say in the story but you can kind of get a hint that rose is older than anna but also younger than paul paul is away so rose has to step in and be the mature one and watch after her little sister she is mature because in the conversation with anna talking about her father rose is trying to soothe annas thoughts about missing her dad
if i had to use one trait to describe rose from this story i would say she is overwhelmed in this story i could tell by her conversations with anna and aunt kolab that she felt like she had too much resting on her shoulders for example when aunt kolab says  this must be difficult for you yes and rose nods
well rose is upset because of her essay and anna tries to confort her like any sister would and rose is angry
rose has forgotten how to care for others by only looking towards the future and forgetting the present from being over worked in the persuit of raising money for her brother she has lost sight of her sister and how to care for her here in this passage she directly ignores her sister  im fine her sister said i just had another bad dream i fell asleep working on my essay rose said paragraph 7 line 1
rose is hopeful that since her aunt sees it her way that her life will get better
her distress defines her as a character  she is worried about what will happen and is feeling great pressure from her family to succeed and to contribute to the family  i drew this from her aunts response to the dream when she said do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help the family a question  she did not answer because the truth would hurt her aunt
rose tried to anna can understand the real problem with their parents and she is trying to do her best to have a good family by her side but anna just dont get the situation for example rose told anna that her parents need to work more and that they have to appreciate the opportunity that they are having in their job and anna just dont get that thats a good opportunity for her family
rose can be described by being stressed in the story it state that her brain became exhausted and is always busy moving from one activity to another
i feel she is respectful because she listens patiently while the other person is speaking
rose seems to always act like the mother in the house when her mother works late  she goes to school has a job cooks supper for the family then she does homework
in the passage rose is feeling weighed down by her family because she has to work and go to school just to be able for her family to live a some what normal life in her conversation with anna anna has a different view of the story because she is younger and doesnt have to work she doesnt see the unjust position that her older sister and he mother are in she doesnt understand why their father had to leave for a better paying job anna has a lot of resentment towards her family but she is continually trying to surpress her feelings in anna and roses conversation anna glared at rose money isnt everything only if you already have everything rose said she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her  we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college this reveals that even though rose loves her family she resents that she has to help send her brother to school but she is putting on a brave face for her little sister and saying that even though they have to work hard it will all get better soon
rose is composed she is breaking under the weight of her essay her job and all the stress in her life yet when anna comes in to talk about her nightmare rose is calm and collected im fine her sister said i just had another bad dream anna is distracting rose from spending much needed time on her essay with a mundane topic but rose still speaks gently to her with the compassion of a loving sister
she is a very respectful person because rose didnt answer her aunt kolabs question because it would hurt her aunt since she feels so weighed down by helping out her family
one trait that can describe rose is caring one detail from the story would be when she was thinking about the fate of two lives resting in pauls hands and one resting in her hands

she feels that everything will get better and her sister should appericate what she has it says when pual finishes college hell pay for us to go to college
she is a worried person she thinks that she does not want to have the responsibility that paul had and she thinks that if she tells her aunt her aunt will be upset
one trait that can describe rose is that she though feels extremely weighed down by her many responsibilites always puts the wellness of her family as a whole before her own well being  this is shown during her conversation with her sister anna  anna is complaining about their father being gone but rose argues that their father needed the far away job to help pay for pauls their older brother college education so that when he gets a job he will help to pay for their education
rose is a hard worker who works to exhaustion as can be seen when she says i fell asleep working on my essay to anna
while rose was talking to her aunt kolab one trait that i saw was that her aunt was very supportive her aunt gave rose a different point of view of the sitution by her saying they can find a way to do things different
rose feels upset because her brother is schooling and she has to take care of everyone  she thinks that after paul finishes college he will get a great job and pay for the two girls tuitions
rose is caring because  if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
she worries too much ex when she tells her aunt about the dream
that aunt kolab would help out rose with her problems and strees she has when aunt kolab said she wouls sew for the ladies or sell things for the communtiy to help out rose
one trait of rose is that she is a very generous person she spends all her time working so she can earn money to help her family
that she was a person who didnt want to listen to anybody
rose wishes to be successful an overachiever with life and education while talking to her sister rose says that her father went off for the better to make more money anna rosess sister is furious and explains that money is not everything in liferose disagrees and says that they have to help paul get through college then herself and anna she feels like she has to put the weight on her shoulders to benefit others she overachieves or tries to throughout the beginning of the story
she tells her aunt everything and is very trustworthy but she feels guilty about what happened to her brother  she had the bad dream about her brother but made herself feel better by talking to her aunt

rose is respectful to her elders she does not want to be honest as to not offend her family in paragraph 19 rose didnt answer because it said she would hurt her aunt
rose is scared and feels that she has to much responsebilty for her age in the story she has a dream of paul weighing down on her which would simbolize the the preasure she feels from having to do as much as she does
rose feels stressed you can tell this by the way she is actin when her sister is trying to talk to her anna is trying to tell rose something and rose says that she sounds just like mama in an angry tone
rose is an easy going person but she is also very stressed out because of all of the help that she is doing for the family so her brother can finish college rose has to work right after school and has no time for her school work
rose always tried to do what was best for her family  it was not until her dream about pauls body drowning her that she realized how stressed she really was as soon as her aunt suggested taking some of the weight off of rose and doing more to help rose instantly felt a little bit more relaxed and grateful towards her aunt
rose sees others points threw their eyes not just hersit says in the story i realize thar you are seeing the situation throught through other eyes
rose is encouraging she was having a very rough day when anna walked into the kitchen rose says we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college despite her feelings she tried to encourage anna and keep their conversation postive
maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldntshe seems undecided but shes willing to take things as they come she has a half positive outlook on things
rose is caring because she is working herself until she is exhausted because she is trying to help out her family by helping pay for her older brothers college
one trait that can describe rose is that she is caring of her family rose fits in school work and helping her aunt cook dinner each day even though she feels she has too much to handle she continues to do these things because she feels it is her responsibility to help her family in the conversation with her aunt kolab she admitted that she felt weighed down by everything she was doing her aunt then offered to sell treats from cambodia to lessen roses responsibility leaving rose feeling lighter
i think that rose is resentful of the fact that her family is not with her that paul needs the money their father is making while in los angeles that makes him have to be so far away from the rest of the family also that she feels that she has to help to bring paul into college
rose is very jealous of her brother paul
rose is very considerate of others and puts others before herself this was shown when she talked to both anna and aunt kolab when she talked to aunt kolab she realized that everything she was doing for paul and for the family was worth it she shows this when she says cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing
she is a hard worker she goes to school then straight to work then home to cook and finally does her homework which just so happens to be a 3000 word essay
she is very stressed by the wieght she has on her shoulders
rose is hardworking because she weighs herself down with responsibilities for the purpose of supporting her family
rose is a type of person that doesnt give up eaisly and fights untill she gets it all worked out when her and her sister were fighting she kept arguing untill they came to a conclusion and they both felt they had won and walked away
in the story rose is very mature she is trying to succeed in school help out around the house and blance a job although her situation isnt ideal she performs the same tasks everyday i noticed her maturity when her aunt asked is she felt weighed down by the family rose didnt reply because she didnt want to hurt her aunt this shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others but also understand her families situation at her age this shows maturity
rose is very determined she does everything she can to help pay for her brothers college even though she is exhausted and stressed in the conversation between rose and anna in paragraph 11 rose says we have our part to do to help paul finish college this statement shows that rose knows how important it is for her and her sister to stick through the hard times to get the money for her brother
one trait that can describe rosa is talented talented descrides her dream and yet the fact that she came up with a story about her dream it was also creative she didnt just pick some idea and settle with it she put time and effort
one of the traits that rose has is careing during the conversation with anna rose is asking her whats wrong and if she feels okay she cares about her and her family one other example would be when she is talkin to aunt kolab she doesnt want to tell her that its too much work for her to handle she doesnt want to upset them because she cares about how they feel
rose is a dedicated person while she is talking to aunt kolab she figures out what topic she is going to write her essay about which shows her dedication to getting her work done rose is also proved to be dedicated by working on her essay until she falls asleep and keeps up with school and a job
rose cares about how other people will feel if she really tells them how she feels for example when aunt kolab asks rose if she feels wieghed down by what she is doing for her family roses response is if i told the truth i would hurt my aunt and she might tell mother
rose felt more hopeful after talking to her aunt the story tells us that her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
rose is very selfish
rose is a strong individual because she hasnt seen her dad in four monthsplus she has to go to school then right after school she goes to work and after she gets off of work she has to do homework 
unsure is a trait i would use to describe rose one example is how she if fretting andunsure about the essay contest coming up and shes also unsure about her brother is what her dream showed
i hate how late she has to work
in the story aunt kolab asked if rose felt like the family is wieghing her down even though it was true she decided not to answer this makes me assume that rose is a very helpful and respectful person
rose is a person that tried and do watever she can to help out her family like she works at a restuarant to help around the house roses mother always have to work late
one trait attributed to rose is a sense of hopelessness in the dream she puictures her self collapsing under the weight of her responsibilities and under her brothers
she is very mature and you can tell because she can fell the stress from paul and knows her responsibilities
she has always been so busy
she has faith in everything she does and she cares about her sister i believe its because she tells her sister that everything will work out and that they will go to college like their brother
rose hides how she really feels to both of the characters this is one trait that she has and she shows it by not saying what she really whats too
one character trait that i can identify about rose is that she is not very outspoken due to her conversation with aunt kolab she seemed like she was scared to tell her aunt how she relly felt because she was afraid of hurting her aunts and her mothers feelings
rose is faithful she is faithful because she doesnt want to hurt anyone in her family she does what she is asked because she knows its the right thing to do in the story the aunt askes do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help thins family  and rose didnt answer because the truth would hurt her aunt and she doesnt want to hurt anyone rose is a good person
rose acts like she is resentful to her family when she lists all the struggles she went through with her normal day it sounds like she resents having to do what seems like all the work she goes to school then to work at a restraunt then she had to go home and work more to prepare dinner
one trait that can describe rose is a presistance her school day was very long after school she went to work and did a long shift then came home and made supper and now she was trying to make a threethounsand word essay that takes someone who is a hard worker and who is persistant
rose is very understanding in her attempt to calm anna down this trait is expressed by the way she trys to explain why papa is gone for example when anna started to bring up the fact that papa has bein gone for a while rose trys to help by saying its only been four months
rose is a heard worker like her dad her dad took a job in los angels he doesnt get to see his family much
in the story rose seems to be overworked from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was tim to do homework
rose is obviously very confused she has a great burden to carry but is confused by what other people think of it
rose is selfless when anna came into the kitchen to talk to her after her nightmare she started talking about how she misses papa and she wishes mama didnt have to work such late hours anna im sure felt the same way but she hid her feelings because she had to make anna feel better she had to put her little sister before herself
rose respects and cares about how other people might thin before she speaks in the story she didnt want to tell her aunt something because she didnt want to hurt her feelings
rose was a very hard working girl she felt really lonely because her dad had just left and her mother worked most of the day she said she felt too young for so much responsibility
detuerminedeshe said that they had to do their part to help paul get thru college then he will get a good job and hell pay for them to go to college
rose is always tired or busy because when rose was talking to anna rose said that she fell asleep or she could not get the essay done
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with her sister anna would be she sounds like she wants to be in charge of her sister anna rose acts like a mother figure to anna one example from the passage would be when anna rolled her eyes and shoved the chair away from the table and said you sound just like mama
rose doesnt think she is all to great  in the beginning she was having trouble writing an essay  she then tells her sister how she fell asleep while writing it and thinks money is everything  then later on she tells her aunt kolab of her dream and how much pressure is on her  rose thinks she is the underdog in the family
a trait to describe rose would be stressed aunt kolab said do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family rose didnt answer because if she told the truth it would hurt her aunt
rose is mature we know this because when she talked to aunt kolab she does not want to hurt her aunt and therefore does not answer the question about if she feels weighed down
based on roses conversations with her aunt and her sister rose is very mature from the situation she has already been put in when rose comes in the kitchen to find her aunt she confesses that it is difficult
she is a kind person but she is weighted down with all that is happening to her and her family     she felt too young for so much responsibility
she is very responsible she works at a restaurant and is a full time school student  she took care of her little sister when she woke up from a bad dream
rose has a charateristic of being very worrisome in the conversation with her aunt she thinks to herself if her life will get easier or not
one trait is when rose said as gently as she could one detail is when she woke up and came downstairs and her aunt said  do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family and anna didnt reply
one trait that could be used to describe her would be strong strength seems to fit her based on what she is trying to do for her family and trying to get a better education as well
rose is generous she doesnt tell about how she really feels because shes concerned about everyone else it is shown in paragraph 18 aunt kolab says do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing for this family then in paragraph 19 when the narrator states rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt this shows that rose is generous and concerned of the wellbeing of others
rose is very quiet when she was talking to aunt kolab she just kept nodding when she was talking to anna she kept changing the subject and suppressing how she really felt about the situation
she is stressed and seems to be having trouble managing everything that needs to be done but she is willing to do it to help out her family in her converstation with anna she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college this passage shows that she is aware of how hard it is now but all her work will pay off eventually
i would say that rose is a sad girl who doesnt always know what to do and is trying to see if others would help with out makeings it worse on her or her family she feels like she is the one that is holding the family together
rose is a responsible character in that she helps write an essay for her older brother and is still able to carry that weight with her  she never once asked somebody else in the story to help her
you sound just like mama
that she worries much about her her father  she tries to say as gently as she could in paragraph 14 it says pauls fate lies partly in these she thought she felt far too young for so much responsibiltity then she shivered imagining how her brother must feel only three years older he held the fate of two peopleboth his sistersin his hands so the trait would be that cares about people her family
rose respects her aunt kolab and in paragrapg 19 she didt want to tell the truth and her aunt kolabs feelings in some way
rose is sad she misses her dad very much
one trait about anna based on this story is that she really wants to help her family but shes feeling very pressured she thinks that the fait of the family is all on her this is shown in the dream she has in paragraph 15 when she is being held underwater by her oblivious older brother
when rose had woke up and ask anna was sh eok then she told her s he had fell asleep on her essay again
rose is a very realistic person in the last paragraph from the story she opens up to her aunt a little to let her know how stressed out she is her aunt offers other alternatives to making money and this is good for rose although rose knows its a good opprotunity she does not get her hopes up because she knows that everything might not get better for her or her family this shows she is realistic because she has hope but she also knows the reality of the situation might not allow things to be improved
rose is takes in to thougth to what her aunt said to change her thoughts that nothing would surely work out maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldnt  but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
rose is very senitive and really needs her sisters helpyou sound just like mama
rose keeo nodding maybe her life would get easier rose is always is busy and always forgets something she has to do until the last minute and trys to squeeze it into the day that is already as busy as can be
rose is thoughtful from the conversation she had with her aunt she takes in her family she wanted the essay to be so good and didnt want her brother to look bad that it started to weight on her mentially
she has a positive personality  she says then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for yo and me to go to college
when rose was talking to anna she tried to be strong to give anna some hope that showed that she is sincere and it also shows that she is a strong individual that wants to help out if she can
rose is stressed out she has too many things to do right now in her life she has to go to school then work a fourhour shift then cook supper for her family and finally work on her essay she feels she is overworking herself so that her family is supported
rose is very considerate of those around her she supresses her own feelings to make others feel better as shown in the following quote rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt rose does not tell her aunt what she is truly feeling so as not to upset nor disappoint her aunt
rose is very responsible but needs a break or a little weight lifted she does what she is supposed to do
rose appears very mature she attempts to make an explanation for her father when anna comes out to talk she also shows maturity when she chooses to talk about her problems with her aunt kolab
one trait that descibes rose based on her conversation with anna is mature because she understand what is going on in her house with the money sitution she tries to explain to anna why her dad is gone for so long
rose is a pesimist rose says even if i win i wont get to travel to sacramento she also said  if we had everything refering to her dad working away from home
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with her younger sister anna is that rose is optimistic one detail from the story that can support this is when she is explaining to anna that paul their brother will get a good job and pay for anna and rose to go to college rose is displaying her sense of optimism by talking about the good things that will happen in the future
rose is very mature about her family problems the example in the would be when she tells anna he had to go the job in los angeles paide three times what he was making here     she understands and still misses her father just as much as anna
rose seems to have a sense of duty she says that we have our part to do to help paul finish college
from this story we can infer that rose is a worried person she is always worried about other people and trying to be the best she said she was worried about getting her essay done so she could win she wanted to be the best and actually win the contest then she was worried because she couldnt make it to sacremento to claim the prize if she did win she had taken too much time off and was on the verge of getting fired that made her worry even more because then she would be out of a job
rose is very stressed out the story lets me know by saying she felt too young for so much responsibility
when she is talking to her sister and she does not respond to what anna had to say shows she is not that caring about what other people have to say she is more selfish
that she is sometimes willin to listen but somethimes not but when she hears something she likes she gets incouraged she learns how to give and help others out
rose is a very caring person who tries not to hurt anyone you know this by the way the author stated that she tried to tell anna as gentle as she could that their father had only been gone for four months she wants tobe free but rather she would want the happiness of her own family before hers since rose is a caring person  maybe that is why she didnt wan to hurt her aunts feelings when they were having a conversation
rose seems very busy and she has no time to herself she said she didnt know when she would squeeze in writing a flawless threethousandword essay
one trait that can descirbe rose based on her conversation with anna is shes loyal to her family  while she was conversing with her sister she claims that she and anna have to work hard for their brother also rose defends her mother and father when anna complains that theyre both away working
rose is hardworking in the story it says  from school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a fourhour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper
she is a good person she only wants the best for annna
i think one trait that can describe rose would be how caring and unselfish she is in the story rose says with her hands cupped pauls fate lies partly in these she cares abut paul so that is why she tries so hard in everything she does
rose is a hard worker she goes to work at the restaurant and still comes home to help cook supper after supper she does her homework she also is trying to win a three thousand word essay contest
i think rose is a very caring person  she cares about anna and her parents  she realized that her dad had to go get that better job to support the family  one detail from the story is that rose cares about her job and her family  she believes her parents must work to provide for them
rose is a very determined person because of what she does for her family despite all the stress from school and work she still finds time to write an essay for a competition outside of school she also exhibits determination in that she does not tell her younger sister about all her problems so she does not make her sister worry
rose cant help remember her father sinking to the floor
one trait that describes rose is confused one thing that supports this is that she doesnt know what she wants to do in life when she was talking to her aunt
rose is very understanding she isnt stubborn about doing things that other american teenagers wouldnt ever have to do she understands that her family needs her help in supporting her brother sister and everyone else one detail from the story would be this we have our part to do to help paul finish college found in paragraph 11 line 2
roses younger sister walked in rubbing her eyes because rose was having a bad dream
rose is a very optimistic person when she was talking to anna she was able to always look on the bright side of their situation anna was naming the bad things that are going on in their lives at the time and rose always said something optimistic
rose is a very caring and understanding person but she feels as thought he familys weight on her is pushing her down her dream would be a good example of this  and how it is affecting her
rose sees the need to have money for the family while her sister would rather not have as much money and everyone be together and at home  anna doesnt want their father to be in los angeles or their mother working so late  rose however explains to her sister that the money is needed to be able to live and their brother to be able to get a college education that would let him get a good job  the good job would then help bothe rose and anna go to college
one trait that was about rose was that she wanted papa to go and just come back with the money it was all about the money untill she started talking to her sister and then had the dream that changed it all her perspective of the whole situation was totally different
rose is understandig because she understood that her father went away for a better paying job
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that she is very caring of other people in paragraph 19 sentence 2 rose chooses not to answer aunt kolabs question if she tells her the truth rose knows that the statement will hurt her so she doesnt say it
rose is responsible in here conversation with anna we have our part to do to help paul finish college she is helping her brother through college so she can then go to college too that shows a great deal of responsiblity
she listens to other people and what they have to say when aunt kolab is talking to rose in paragragh 20
rose is trying to help her family get more money her aunt kolab tries to help her by saying that she will sew for some ladies or make treats
she is greedy she wanted someone to leave so that they could get a job that pays three time more
rose seems always depressed and angry she says mamas not home yet is she i hate how late she has to work her voice sant to a fierce whisper
rose seems to be a very caring person she tends to keep her pain bottled up in front of her younger sister anna she does this because she wants to instill hope in her baby sister rose knows that the situation the family is in is difficult for anna to handle being so young when anna and rose are talking in the kitchen anna mentions missing their father although rose misses her dad deeply she finds a way to justify him being gone again for annas sake
a trait that i think that rose has is commitment i think this because she goes to school works helps with dinner and still does her homework it takes a lot to do so much through out one day and her commitment to doing all of this is helping her and her family
they have the same ataitod as each other like when the two sisters are fighting in the kitchen
rose is determined  when she talks to her little sister anna she feels that she needs to be brave for anna and not show her how she really feels so she wont worry anna
she is caring in paragraph 5 she is conserned about her sister and ask her if shes feeling okay
she worries about her father so i guess she cares deeply about people in paragraph 14 she says in the dark pose clasped then cupped her hands pauls fate les partly in these shes obviously worried about her father and in paragraph 8 shes worried about her mom having to work so late
rose is very selfless your hear in the story about ll of the stress and anxiety in her life in order to help her brother go to college but she doent complain to others when roses aunt offers to help with the situtation and take some stress off of roses shoulders rose doesnt show excitement for the relief of all her stress rose just politely nodds and thinks about how maybe her life will become easier
rose is responsible and understanding she does everything she can to help her family and doesnt complain about how hard it is on her
rose is sympathetic towards her family i know this because in roses and her and aunt kolabs conversation rose didnt answer when her aunt asked do you feel weighed down by what youre doing to help this family because she knows if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and her aunt would probably of told her mother
rose got help from there aunt that means that she got help instead of not doing her essay her aunt told her that she should do the essay on the cambodian tradition and sense of family she also discovered that she could survive an ocean crossing
one trait that rose has is hope even though her family is having hard times she is still hoping her and anna will be able to go to college rose shows hope when she says we gave our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college
rose is very dedicated to her family and is willing to do what she can to help themrose has a job to help put her brother through college and she helps her aunt cook dinner when her mother is at work
guilty             do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
when rose clasped her hands together picturing the fact that she was clasping and cupping her hands to prove a point in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands
rose is thoughtfull when she was asked if she felt like she was being weighed down by having to take a big role in taking care for her family she kind of knodded instead of complaining about it to her aunt
a trait that can descrie rose based on her conversation with both anna and aunt kolab would have to be worried or frantic this is because she is worried about her essay and her family as well which builds a lot of pressure on her in the end she will eventually snap from all the unnesseccary pressures
rose seems like the type of person who would worry to much but at the same time she likes to help people and she cares about other people too for example rose asks her sister if she was okay to see what was wrong with her
she doesnt like to tell anyone how she is really feeling if itll end up hurting them in paragraph 19 she shows how she thinks aunt kolab would react if she told how she really feels about helping with the family
one trait that can describe rose would be hard working it says in the second paragragh that rose had gone to work strait from school works a fourhour shift then goes straight home to do homework i would imagine that rose would be a very hard worker knowing that she has a job and she is smart in school and has the opportunity to send a letter in and get sent to sacramento just to recieve the prize so in my eyes rose is a very hard worker
rose has many traits but one that stands out to me is her willing to thrive and how hard working she is rose had long days but she never stopped rose went to school the straight to a fourhour shift the straight home to help her aunt kolab for dinner then she worked on her home work she never stopped to take time for herself or a social life
rose is a very busy person first she has a long exhuasting day of school after school she works a fourhour shift then she runs home and helps aunt kolab prepare a quick supper finally she has to do her homework
in her conversations we can see that rose is scared to say how she really feels in the story it says that if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt

based upon the story it can be concluded that rose cares about other peoples feelings  in paragraph 19 rose does not allow her aunt to realize that she feels so greatly burdened by her responsiblities  she believes that if her aunt were to know this fact she would be hurt and will also tell her mother who then would also be hurt
rose supresses her feelings and keeps them bottled up her aunt asked her a question and she didnt answer because she knew she would get hurt if she answer she would have rather kept to herself
i think one trait that would best describe rose would be had working in the story rose is so busy because she is trying to help her family as best as she can and starts to feel pressured by it rose does a lot she goes to work comes home help make dinner and does her homework i thinkg that shows that she is hardworking because most people crack and fail but she keeps doin because she wants to help her family and go to a good college
rose is a understanding person rpse acknowledges that her dad has to be away so that her brother can go to coellege and get a good job rose understands that she is helping to put paul through coellege and he will help her and anna
rose is under stress rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier

one trait rose had in her conversation with aunt kolab is caring she is caring about trying to help her family

anna was only a high school student with alot on her mind she had the responsibility of an adult for an example she not only had to live her kid life by going to school and doing homework but she also had a job and had to take care of her little sister and also she helped prepare food all of that can cause a lot of stress which is why she was sleepy and day dreaming and which is also why she had that dream because drems do relate to what your feeling so therefore all of that made her stronger and also gave her something to write about in the end for her essay
i think rose is stressed out because of how urgently she needs to tell aunt kolab about her dream
rose lives poor she supports her family and feels like the world is caving in on her she cant handle the pursure anymore and dont want to tell anyone
idk because i cant read jp
rose is very outgoing she goes to school works cares for her family and still makes time for her school work she keeps her belief that if she can help her brother through college he will help her through school so she can live a better life than what she has at the time anna tells rose money isnt everything rose says differently that money isnt everything if you already have everything
rose feels like everything that anna and she does relates to paul in some how in the story it says we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna hell pay for you and me to go to college

she is mean
well during the conversation of rose and aunt kolab i noticed that rose is confused about certain things when it comes to cambodia  when they talk about looking at something in a different perspective i see rose not looking at in jer eyes but in everyone elses eyes  in cambodia our first country what were all doing would be quite normal her aunt said  but now i realize that youre seeing the situation through other eyesas you should i suppose because you grew up here this must be difficult for you yes
she feels like the weight of the world is on her shoulder
anna thinks rose is to worried about the essay and rose thinks even if she wins she wont even get to travel to sacramento to recive the prize
rose is determined and responible for many things in paragraph 2 it talks about how long roses day is and what she has to do she has schooling and work but most of all shes respectful by going straight home to help her family
rose sometimes suppresses her feelings from others      only if you already have everything rose said we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for you and me to go to college    rose says this but leaves out how tired and horrible it really is for her
from this story you can infer that rose has a strong sense of responsibility you can easily see this in her internal conflicts in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands pauls fate lies partly in these she thought this shows that she knows full well what is on her shoulders she knows the amount of work she must put in

one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with anna is that she is caring  even though rose probably feels just as bad as anna does because their father is gone she hides and it does her best to comfort anna  the line she tried a laugh that sounder fake even to her suggests that rose doesnt nesecarily believe everything she is saying  she says it to make anna feel better though and that is why she is caring
rose is a good kindhearted person who was trying to be positive for her sister when anna was mad about her dad leaving her mom being at work and the family having no money rose tried to lighten the mood and make her sister laugh even though she had stayed up late with the paper and was cranky she never took it out on anna

rose looks at the bright side of things when her sister anna was talking about how she missed their father rose was the one saying that it was a good thing that he was gone because their family needs the money
it seems like rose is an outgoing girl but doesnt have any confidents in herself it looks like she gives up to soon before she even trys like when shes talking to her sister and she says im so lonesome for papa it seems like hes been gone for years well it just seems like she doesnt think she can do anymore until he comes back also if she writes the 300 word essay she has a chance to go to sacramento but then she says my boss is already mad at me and i would more likly get fired well right then is where shes giving up she could go to her boss and talk to him about it but instead she pretty much gives up

rose seems to be very understanding shes willing to do anything to help paul with college and doesnt second guess it when shes talking to anna she tells herwe have our part to do to help paul finish college
i can infer that rose is more concerned about her little sister that she is about herself  i can tell this because she seems to hide her true emotions when speaking to anna  rose tells anna exactly its only been four months  he had to go  the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here  after this a few lines down anna tells rose you sond just like mama  i am sure that rose has heard all that she said from her mother and was simply repeating it to anna to comfort her little sister
blunt rose straight out explains to anna and aunt kolab how she feels
one trait that describes rose is smart because her sister doesnt get that money is accually everything in this world rose knows that in order to survive money is needed
rose feels somewhat guilty
rose is thoughtful she talks about her brother during most of the story and you can see how bad she wants to help him she has an essay that is due and she wont even try to start on it because she is so worried about her brother
rose is a caring person we see this when she talks to anna she asks anna whats wrong instead of going straight to herself falling asleep on her essay
rose got the trait that she was just naturaly good at what she did for example she was always good at wrighting essays ever since she was a little kid
when rose talks to anna she feels exhausted she is trying to help the family so much that she is unable to think strait rose cant think of anything to write for her essay and when she starts working on it she is distracted the first time anna had woke rose up because she had a bad dream then anna and rose talk about where their mom is

confusedaunt kolab dou feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
rose has a good mindset she knows her college will be paid for so she isnt upset about anything she knows how to plan her future
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is hope  aunt kolab gave rose the feeling of hope by exploring other options that could benefit the family  one detail that supports my answer is rose recognizing that her life would get easier if people search opportunities to help support their family
rose is so exhaulted about writting her essay she keeps on falling asleep while trying to write it
based on the conversations rose had with anna and aunt kolab you can tel that she is very soft spoken as well as shy  during her first conversation she holds back what she is truly feeling inside  then in the second conversation she simply nods agreeing with her aunt both of these help convey roses shy and soft spoken personality trait
she suppressed her feelings until she couldnt keep them inside her any more when she talked to anna she made everything sound fine but she really missed her father too
in the story i feel like rose was a very realistic person i think this because when rose discussed the topic about their father not being around with anna rose knew he was gone for a reason to help his family and she knew that was how things had to be to support their family
rose didnt answer because she new that tekking the truth would hurt her aunt
considerate when she was talking to aunt kolab instead of telling her how she really felt she did not say anything because she knew it would hurt her aunts feelings

she is a responsible girl based on the part where she is talking about helping her brother pay for college so that he can help when she goes to college
rose is a very mature girl
rose is a girl who really cares about her family and if something needs to be done she will do it in her conversation with aunt kolab aunt kolab asks if rose feels weighed down and because rose didnt want to hurt her  aunt and felt like it was her job she did not tell her aunt the truth showing that she cares for her family and she will do what needs to be done
rose is a respectfull being she is worried about how her sister anna is feeling when she walks in rubbing her eyes
roses character i believe can be summed up in a short few sentences between her and her sister anna in paragraph 10 sentence 2 anna states that in her opinion money isnt everything roses feelings towards this statement are quite obvious with her response in paragraph 11 sentence 1 only if  you already have everything here we can interpret from her words that anna feels money especially in her familys case is quite important she feels that money usually is very important unless you have everything else in this sentence we can see a glimpse of how rose feels about the dependancy of money when it comes to the outcome of her and her sisters futures
rose is confused you can see this when her aunt says this must be difficult for you

she is a very busy person she hardly ever has time to do anything while shes at school working or helping her aunt with supper
hardworkingfrom school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt  rose did not want to hurt her aunt or her mother to find out so she did not answer her
how she still has some hope left after all thats been done through out her life when shes talking to anna about thier father she knows things are bad but for her sisters sake she has to be strong and believe things will get better
hopeful rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier
rose when speaking to aunt kolab shows a great deal of respect i know this because when her aunt asked her about being weighed down rose didnt want to say her real answer because it would hurt aunt kolab and her mothers feelings if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt as you can see in this qoute from the passage this supports my conclusion
rose is like a mother always worrying and trying to act older than she should when rose and anna were talking about college and hell pay for you and me to go to collegeanna said she sounded just like mama

one trait that can descrive rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that she thinks about other peoples feelings one example from the story that supports that she thinks about other peoples feeling is when she is talking to her aunt kolab in paragraph 19 when she said if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
in her conversation with anna rose can be described as being a maternal figure for anna rose tries to calm anna after her bad dream and not tell her how she really feels about the situation their family was in
a trait that describes rose is she cares about her family and their feelings a detail from the story that supports my answer is when anna is talking with her aunt she does not want to tell her aunt the truth because she is afraid it will hurt her feelings
