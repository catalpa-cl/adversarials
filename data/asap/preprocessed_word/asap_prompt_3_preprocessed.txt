one mans pet anothers invasive species
by joel achenbach
bushnell fla robroy maclnnes is the man to see if you want to buy a crocodile or a scorpion a rattlesnake a boa constrictor got a hankering for a cobra just pony up 600 and you can have one of the more lethal species
it is a very effective threat display maclnnes 49 says as a pakistan black cobra six feet long hissing hood spread writhes in its enclosure and strikes again and again and again at the thin glass separating the creature from a visitor a snake like that coining at you youd leave him alone
or simply die of fright
maclnnes is coowner of glades herp farms an empire of claws spines scales fangs and darting tongues the reptile trade hes happy to report is booming the pet industry estimates that about 48 million households now contain at least one pet reptile a number that has nearly doubled in a decade reptiles are increasingly popular in a crowded urbanized nation they dont need a yard you dont have to take a lizard for a walk
but biologists see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species such as the burmese python which is breeding up a storm in the everglades and the nile monitor lizard a toothy carnivore that can reach seven feet in length and has found a happy home along the canals of cape coral under a new state law a customer must obtain a 100 annual permit to buy a monitor lizard or some of the largest snakesfour species of pythons and the green anaconda the animal must also be implanted with a microchip that tag could help officials identify the animal if it turns up later in the wild 
maclnnes contends that the government overestimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles he says hes being blocked by the us fish and wildlife service from importing some commercially attractive animals such as fiji island iguanas and radiated tortoises from madagascar
even the term invasive species is unfair he said theyre introduced i think that invasive is passing judgment
of the pythons he said to me its a wonderful introduction i think its the best thing to happen to the everglades in the last 200 years
biologists however say that invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity life on earth has always moved around but never so fast organisms evolve in niche environments what happens when the natural barriers are removed when anything can go anywhere
complications ensue
snakes alive
skip snow a wildlife biologist for everglades national park has helped drag hundreds of burmese pythons out of the weeds of roadways and even from under the hood of a tourists car he calls maclnness argument ridiculous the snakes he says are imperiling five endangered species in the florida keys including the key largo wood rat one specimen of which tagged with a radio transmitter was tracked all the way to the belly of a python 
no one knows how the snakes went native but theres speculation that hurricane andrew which obliterated thousands of homes played a factor in a wholesale python jailbreak in 1992 many invasive species undergo a lag before proliferating whats certain is that by 2002 pythons were seen in multiple locations in remote regions of the everglades
then one morning in early 2003 a bunch of tourists on the parks anhinga trail a reliable location for viewing wildlife were startled to see an alligator with a python in its mouth 
even more dramatic was what happened in the everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator and theres not a delicate way to put it exploded the photograph ran around the world it wasnt pretty but you had to look
this february the us geological survey reported that pythons in asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of the continental united states a usgs map showed potential python habitat stretching from california to delaware and including much of the south you could conceivably have pythons snacking their way right up the potomac
the map wasnt a prediction of where the snakes will actually spread however media coverage of it was overly sensational argues the maps coauthor robert reed
when was the last snake story that didnt get sensationalized he asked
ecophobia is playing a role said jamie k reaser a science and policy adviser to the pet industry joint advisory council mammals are warm and fuzzy birds tend to have quite a following but animals such as lizards and snakes tend at least in this culture to be less well respected or supported  
the experiment
what is happening in florida illustrates a broader fact about life on earth we live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists a generalist is a raccoon a python a cockroach a whitetailed deer the ultimate generalist is arguably a human being who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere from florida to antarctica to outer space its no accident that the species that have become most abundant are often those that do best in and around humans
a specialist is chinas panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australias koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively
maclnnes is not without an environmental conscience
were degrading the earth at an alarming rate he said will man go extinct before we reach the point where we figure it out
he added what favors generalists is change what favors specialists is stability right now mankind has chosen to make earth a rapidly changing place
down in the everglades skip snow would agree with that part of maclnness philosophy we are all part of a vast experiment in the blending of organisms from around the world he said
the thing about the experiment is its not planned and theres no one in control snow added its an experiment run amok

pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they can only survive in very special climates with specific food sources these are different from pythons because pythons can adapt better and eat many different things this is shown in the map provided with the article because it shows pythons could survive in 17 states
the pandas and koalas are alike because they both only eat one thing as with the pythons they eat a few different things they are different types of animals so they need different things
pandas in china are similar to koalas in aus because they are both anunaunt  and specialists that eat bamboo eucalyptus leaves so they cant be harmful to humans they live in a certain place unlike pythons which are generalists so they can rang from florida to antartica to outer space
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia by which they both are specialist pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively verse pythons are generalist that could eat anything
pandas and koalas are similar in theyre eating habits chinas panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australias koala bear which eat leaves almost exclusively they differ from pythons because the article explains how pythons eat all of the habitats native animals causing potential extinction where as these 2 bears do not
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they dont eat everything they are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything

both pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they they are specialist this means that they would not be able to survive anywhere else because the certain food sources they need are only incaled in china and australia a python  a generalist is different because it can live anywhere on earth as long as it has a climate that is suitable
pandas are specialist meaning they dine on bamboo koalas do much of the same thing they eat only eucalyptus leaves both these animals are different from pythons in the article the author talks about them being generalists this means the python can live almost anywhere in the world pandas and koalas however can not
