a group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation
procedure
1 determine the mass of four different samples
2 pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers
3 place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container
4 after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
5 allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
6 determine the mass of each sample
the students data are recorded in the table below
after reading the groups procedure describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment make sure to include at least three pieces of information
some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar
after reading the expirement i realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one the amant of vinegar you poured in each container two label the containers before you start yar expirement and three write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate
what you need is more trials a control set up and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cupbeaker you could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour
the student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure
for the students to be able to make a replicate they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the expirement
i would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers and what are they drying into
the information i would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment also the materials that was used to creat the experiament after the 24 hours of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture
you would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment you would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure you would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container you would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use plastic for example might alter the results
some additional information you will need are the material you also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it you need to know how much vineager is used for each sample another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way
inorder to replicate the experiment we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining masshowever revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required
an additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
the additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples also you would need to know the kind of vinegar in a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers
there are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are alsothe procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container a good procedure would have specified this
in order the replicate the experiment you need
well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples put them in different containers that look the same put vinegar on every sample  finally rinse them out with normal water  let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry then your finally going to see the difference between those samples
i dont know what is going on
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the shape of each material because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass changes the results i would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment
the additional information i would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain after that i will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so i can tell and see each one is different in mass i will organize the data to see if the information is accurate then i will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct
in order to replicate this experiment i would need a scare in order to get the mass next i would need tape and markers to label the containers last i would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment
in order for the me to replicate their procedure i would need to know what four samples they used they should include that in their procedure also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment i would in as close to what they actually did and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment
you would need to have four seperate but identical containers you would also need to pour in each of them vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them and new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers
inorder to replicate the experiment i would need to know the mass of the four different samples how much vinegar to pour into the containers what the samples were made up of and how much water to rinse them with after the 24 hours
the students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored they also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started
for this experiments duplication you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup you would also have to know how big in size each container was additionally you would need to know the size of each sample to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly
some additional information that i would need is the amount of vinegar they poured
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what type of vinegar they were using because it could of been any type what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldnt have valid results and they also should have told me what they were holding constant because i wouldnt know what variables to use or control
they needed to include what time they started and when they ended also the amount of vinegar they used also the size of each sample
1 get 4 different samples marble limestone wood plastic p 2 put each sample into 4 different containers p 3 pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers p 4 after 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w distilled water p 5 allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min p 6 determine the data of each sample p 7 record your data
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were in this groups procedure they do not state what
in step three you would need to know how much of each sample to use also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much also there is no control variable
i additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable i would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical container
you will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up
for this experiment you would actually need to know what each sample is the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each sample
to replicate the experiment i would need to know the samples that i will be using i would also need to know how much vinegar to use i would also need to know what type of containers to use
in order to replicate the experimentyou would need to know how much vinegar to pour you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it
well i would need to know what the problem statement is i would need to know what type of cups we are usingi would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using and i would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure
i will need to know whats the purpose for this experiment know the difference in mass for each sample and i need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was
they should add how much vinegar to add to each sample for this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know first how to calculate the mass of the samples i would also need t o know what the four samples are as if is not stated in the procedure lastly to repeat this expirement i would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container
additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experimentwhat materials are going to be usedand how much of each material will be used
in order to replicate this experimentyou would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container you also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in also you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water
after reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water
determine what the different samples are then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample state how long you are rising the materials in water ex 5 minutes
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need a lot of additional information first of all i would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples rocks bark
i think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cupsfor instance  they could say each of the cork samples and place sample  into cup labeled a
one extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers the words a sample doesnt specify the exact amount of each rock are needed a repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results
there could be more than 1 test for each sample there could also have a constant added to the expariement also there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
they should take more notes that way in case they mess up they can have a the information how to redo it
how much vinager should you pour with what label and when to sit it it sitand dry for 30 minlabel the containers reapetedly separate but identicle conatainer what containers should we use
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the different mauterials were i would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was
in the experiment  i would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label i would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water let the samples dry and find the mass difference
in order to complete this experiment three aditional thing should be included the first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup the second is to list the far samples in the procedure the third is to record the information obtained
in order to replicate the groups i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples
the procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using marbles limestone wood plastic you need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup you need a set amount you could also do the time at different times so you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time
the information i would need to replicate the experiment is the four different samples the four identical containers the amount of time to let the samples sit and the product to rinse the samples with so i could let them sit for more
to repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass
we need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container to make sure that each sample fair results we also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable we also need to know what kind and how big the containers are because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes
some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material we need to know how big the sample would have to be something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in is it room temperature we need to know this
to replicate the experiment the procedure would require more detail one piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment it is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours finally the procedure needs to include details about the experiment for example if the whole sample must be submerged
you would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps that because the experiment only tell you to pour vinegar but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put
this group left same very important thing out of their procedure first of all they didnt tell us what sumples to use for the experiment they didnt tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab
you would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data write down you need to record the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used also when they say place a sample of the material how much of each type am i going to need
first of all youll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you dont accidently have extra weight calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them use the same weight of each sample
to exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know how they measured the mass of the object because without that how would we figure out the different masses we have to know the starting mass the ending mass and the difference in mass
after reading the group procedure i did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers this group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar this group also did not state the reason the data they just said to determine it
i would need the amount of roch in each container i would need the amount of vinegar of r container i would need the same kind of vinegar in each container i would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant  i would also need the amount trials done
1a list of materials and safety requirements p 2the amount of vinegar to put in the containers p 3the temperature of the roomvineger p 4a control group
additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group a control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample we also would need to know
what you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample for example one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar so that can throw their ending masses off
we would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say samples we need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with they would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams
what the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples so what i would do  what they did in the beginning or the investigation i would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples
on statement 2 they need to put the measurement of the containers p on statmen 4 how much water p on number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass
some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container also make sure the times are all on for each sample also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass
in order to replicate ta experiment a person would need to know a few more things they would need to know which substances to use  how much of each one the person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container they would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in one might also want to know what type of container how to write down the findings
you would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container what type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment
additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale have the controlled variable evident in the procedure one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass the endingmass and the difference in mass using grams
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container you would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples also you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same
in order to replicate this experimenti would need to know 3 more things that werent stated in the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containerthe amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off
the additional things that i would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in i would also include the samples of what i am testing in the experiment lastly i would also put in my procedure how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in
in order to replicate this experiment you must be able to know what the four materials are how to measure the mass how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with they should start by saying d determine the massput the tripple beam balance of the four diff samplesname them then pour vinegarhow much into containers then these step of step 4 wash how much distilled water and it would be better
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass for example tripple beam balance etc and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers
you got to put more vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more vinegar so it could do more reaction
another trials the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure its accurate because if not youill change the experiment by changing the most important things
to replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure first we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers enough to cover them next we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material will  we completely submerge it or only partially finally we need to know which materials to use the data indicates them but the procedure does not
three additional pieces of information  i would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials use a control and when its finish to record the data
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information one of them being the amount of each material wood plastic marble and limestone you would also need to know how much vinegar to add finally a constant for each material would alsohelp
the independent varriable is the imarble limestone wood plasticthe marble starting point was 98g the limestone was 104g and wood starting point 112the end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample
additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using secondly in the procedures i nade need to what to weigh the mass in for example they didnt tell you to weigh in grams and i wouldnt be able to complete the experiment easily it doesnt tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate i would need to know that
i think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful im sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples we wouldnt get the same results also we need to know what type of environment we should place this in should it be sunny dark windy hot cold etc i also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be we dont even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples this experiment is missing too much information
in order for i for  replicate this expirement i woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container you would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water you would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in
in order to replicate the experiment we would need a control we would also need the four samples to use and another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one that is what we would need to replicate the experiment
the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container the amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid the results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased therefore the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment
in order to replicate this groups procedure you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure also to ma ke it more clear they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose
in order to replicate the experiment the procedure would have to add more details in the first bullet the four samples should be stated as marble limestone wood and plastic you should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need there should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added one last thing is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should sayin grams
they should have told the samples that was used the second thing was the outcome what happened to the differ
the students need to say what  the samples are they need to
the group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusionthe recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment
additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples in step 2 i would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container also in step 4 i would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long
in order to replicate this experiment some additional information i would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so i would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used
first off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container in step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different marble limestone wood plastic the students also forgot to include step 7 which is find the differences in mass if another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldnt know what they are comparing
if i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp of the room i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used
after reading the groups procedure the following additional information is needed you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp
the additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut also you need to record all the information they need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours
you would need the size of the container amount of vinegar used the types of samples such as earth wood limestone and plastic and how much of each to put in
in addition to the information given you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each containerdifferent amounts could change the results there should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at because change in temperature can affect the corossion process in the experiment it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size
additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups also wat size cups are the liquids poured into in the procedure it says pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers that is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment
some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar
for each box they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average
i would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment what should i be looking for when experiment is going on how do i determine the mas of each sement
some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include what type of samples your using also do explain why you are using vinegar finally to tell the reader what your weighing with and why
if i was to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container the size of the containers and what was used to weigh the samples
in order to replicate this experiment you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc
in order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
you would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples you dont pour the vinegar in instead you say to drops in each container you want everything to be the same and when you pour you dont always get the exact amount for each container also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar
your going to need how much is there in total
pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containersp place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest p after 24 hrs remove sample and rinse p sit and drt for 30 min p determine the mles
to replicate this experiment you would need to know the mass amount of vinegar used in each cup it is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in a different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup the last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment the volume of the cup and or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment
to replicate the experiment i would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared i would also be more specific on the word samples to describe rocks and stones and most importantly i would make a control i would put marble limestone wood and plastic in water
in order to replicate the experiment i would need some additional information first of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar
what you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup also you would need to list the materials you were using another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use
you would need what semples there what you do after number 6
it would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data also a total of the data could have been better too
first you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about next you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put in each container you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample
the additional information i would need to radicate the experiment i would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment i would put after 24 hours remove the samples from the container  rinse each sample w distilled water allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes instead of putting determine the mass of each sample i would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out
i will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are the sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight
in order to replicate this experiment a control would need to be established also a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment in order to accurately replicate this experiment it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours
we would word correct safety measures to takethe controlthe effect of vinegarwhat temperature to store them atwhat the identical containers are made of and its sizewhat type of scale to use to meas itthe amount of vinegar in each containeri more trials
in order to replicate this experiment there are a few more things i need to know the problem does not state what the four different samples are second i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup the amount of vinegar could impact the mass last i would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period different tempuratures might affect the different samples
this question would need to include the measurement of the containers  the amount of vinegar poured in each cup
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container
you would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results
in order to replicate the lab the students did you would need to know what materials were need what kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples
the additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used also they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results lastly it should include the size of the container because it could have a different result
additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step what the samples are going to be it would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar it would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples it would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test
after reading the groups procedure additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in for they need to be identical u also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight
some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit such as in the sun or in the refrigerator how much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using
the students should say in the experiment what samples are being used they should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup
three additional pieces of information that i would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of how much vinegar to pour into each container and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was  also how much distilled water i would need to use
in the procedure i would also need to know how much vinegar to use which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is
in order to complete this experiment you would need additional information you would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment you would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors you might also need to know to know the constants what type of vinegar and what time you started
to replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used the size of the cup and the the size of the samples
after reading the procedure there were a few things i need to know to replicate the experiment one thing is the amount of vinegar used another is how much water to use when rinsing it the last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours there were a few problems with this procedure
i would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not it would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into
i need to know how big the container is  how many of them
what are the sampleswhat is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers
the students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen also they should have stated what they were investigating they should have made a conclusion from the results
in order to replicate the experiment you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers what tools to use such as safety goggles and having more trials
they needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determinedthey need to tell you to table the containers and you need to record tour data
some additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do i put  in each container also what am i supposed to label the container im not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale if so the same scale for each sample also how big are the samples sapposed to be
to replicate this experiment you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup the temperature of the surroundings and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale
to replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid
you would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container i think the students should have started out with the same mass what type of vinegar and does temperature matters
some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar also maybe not have then sit for 24 hours but hav then sit less they could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water
the additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are p 1the amount of vinegar to pour  this must remain constant in a credible experiment p 2the types of samples used should be in the procedure p 3
to replicate the experiment you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers we know that marble lost 4 grams limestone lost 13 grams plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample
we had all the information we need to do the experiment we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they wouldve explained it better to be able to complete the mass because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment youd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container
to replicate the groups procedure i would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers how much of one sample material do they want and how they want us to determine the mass
there are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately in procedure 1 it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish it also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument such as balance beam another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need because if one gets more than another it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with
you would need to tel what type of samples they are also what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples also would need repeat or replicating trials to retest the experiment or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment you ll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of samples i am using the group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample i should measure again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible to know how much of the sample i should be using finally in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i should add to each sample different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently making the experiment inaccurate
in order to be able to duplicate this experiment you need the following information how much vinegar to use also how big are the containers ie what is what is their volume and lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers
additional information i would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample this is because if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would
in order to deplicate this experiment you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour in most cases it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient
to repeat this experiment i would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that i dont know what im testing i also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups i would need to know where to put all of the different containers i dont know if they need to stay at room temp cold or not
you should repeat each step in the experiment start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6
to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers you would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment
what materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight
after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container the more densely packed the samples are i would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments
the procedure has to be more specific it should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end it should have materials listed it should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used because i could have choosen metal carbboard and many other sample materials that they didnt use and would get different results also i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change lastly they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp or by a light source makes a difference too
to replicate the experiment they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment
to replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples
these students procedure was not  a reliable one the material needed to mention what kind of material they uses is there only reducing to ism the sample they also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup the material also that not  include in control groups which is a centered post or any experiment they student variable unchecked they also included only the trial
i would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment
the additional information i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using in step 1 it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples but doesnt tell me which kind in step 2 it tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesnt tell me what size or type of container after sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours i need to find the mass of each sample step 6 but they dont tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf
the group needs to add what to label because
first i woule say you need to get all materials before you do any of that what would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results
first you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers you would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of lastly they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun in a dry cold place etc
in step 1 we need to know what samples it should list the 4 types of rock p in step 4 how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given p in step 6 it should say to correct the new mass of each sample
the procedure is not clear they need to say the sample names because we dont know what it is also they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar finally they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results
we would need observations during the whole experiment  maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed also try another sample
the experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure for example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described the method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials has not been specified in the procedural information
1 i would have to know what kind of area i would have to leave it in for 24 hours temperature p 2 i would have to know what kind of wood to use if there has any specific p 3 also in step 6 it does not say what i have to use to determine the mass of the rocks plastic and wood
in order to replicate the experiment you need to know what the samples are taken of what size the samples should be what size the containers should be and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample
in this groups procedure some additional information shouldve been what were the labels named
additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar you would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use
in order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows ending mass and difference in mass the additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedurei f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
i think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph
in the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone  rock  plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them they could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one marble limestone wood and plastic in the procedure it only explained after 24hrs but they didnt write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time
after reading the groups procedurei found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments i need to know the independent variable dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers
after reading that groups procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample the last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be
the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample in order to find the mass of only the sample you need to subtract the mass of the container also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample i also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when i am waiting 24 hours lastly i need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react
in order to replicate the experiment the person performing it should do a few things differently first they should state what materials they are using second they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container and third they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses
need to know how much vinigar to put in each container how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water  the size of the container would be essential as well so you would know how much vinegar should be used
additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials to find out what the starting mass was to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass
you would need more marble limestone wood and plastic
you would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in the amount of water they where rinsed in and the amount of each sample
i dont know what replicate means so i dont know how to anser this question
first it doesnt tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers next it doesnt say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes maybe they need a cover for it but we dont know from this information in addition there is an information about how they determined the mass
in the groups procedure three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours
1 what kind of sample of material are you using 2 how much vinegar should we put in the containers 3 they should be more clear about how to rinse each sample
i need to know how much vinegar i need to pour on each of pour seperate but dentical containers i need to know what the four different samples are
in order to replicate experiment acid rain you will need  get four seperate but identical containers the materials marble limestone wood and plastic after you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container after you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container after 24 hours rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each containeralso i would need to know of each sample was are solid piece orn  small or pieces the greas would need to identify
they would have to add put each four different sample in four separate but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers
the procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment there should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup the group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off decreasing the mass the group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size
tools
a desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment the it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not and how much vinegar to use
in order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are the experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without the experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain that may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker test tube or a different type of container
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to i would need to also know which type of container to use
one piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure they repeat over and over about different samples but never once tell you what they werethe second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting massending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used
the additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do i leave the containers after i finish putting all the samples into different containers
additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass what are the samplesmarble limestone wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water i think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass therefore ruining the experiment also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass so i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing
the group would need to put in the materials more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure
the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled and what are the four different samples these are informations i need to replicate the procedure
the first thing is why the students are doing this experiment then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container the student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials
first they should of put the amount of vinegar being used they dont say to record there data
additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following p 1 explain what the four different samples would be p 2 explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup p 3another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples p 4 indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples
i
in order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used in this experiment they used marble limestone wood plastic the second step is to find the mass of the four samples then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment thats how i would do this experiment over
we would need to know what the investigation was need to know what kined of sample their talking about what they used to determine the mass all of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better
you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers what order to put samples in  take them out allat once and how long to rinse for
you would need to know how much vinegar was used how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used
the students still need to make a hypothesis a graph and find the difference in mass
one piece of information i would need to know in order to replicate the groups procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegarfilled container i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container i would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples if i used different amounts of water when washing the samples one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results
some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar do we pour into the containers how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water
you need limestone and marble
the information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area what type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass
in order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial and also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a tv and dv contentthey also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
in order to replicate this experiment  i need to know the materials what kind of sample material and why are they doing the experiment how much vinegar rinse or how long
determine the ending mass determine the difference in mass also the mass or everything marble limestone wood and plastic you would need to add up all  three masses starting ending and the difference in mass then you will get the answer to all of them
the steps that this procedure is missing would be to list  gather all materials because you need to know what you are working with 2nd say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with if you dont have this information it would make the experiment very off with validitys the containers wouldnt be the same
the group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made limestone wood 1 plastic instead of just saying  different samples they also say determine the mass of that substances but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass scalethey need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with and how
you would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate finally you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples what instrument to use
to replicate the experimentyou would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2 in step 4 a person would need to know the temperature the 4 samples are waiting 24 hours in in step 3 the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure the actual names of each of the materials should be given temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well
i would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container what four types of materials we need for the experiment to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment
in order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment these are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment
some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it
in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things one thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers lastly i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples
the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample the limestone sample and the wood sample and the plastic sample i would follow the procedure step by step
additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting including writing down the data in the experiment make step 3 to separate stepsalso how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers
first you would need a control the absence of what is effecting the dependant in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar this group had dont write down the amount of vinegar its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment they should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable
there is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment i need to know what the four starting samples are also this procedure needs to include weigh the samples i need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample lastly at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight
three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what ph also the lb of the samples
you would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion
they need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours
what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup however including information about time wouldnt hart the econt either
1 firstly the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are how big they are what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment p 2 the group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container how much is needed p 3 the group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container even though this is just vinegar their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab goggle inclusion would also be rise
the procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing they need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format the way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately
additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container how long do you rinse the samples  do the samples stay outside or inside  day or night 
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information what are four samples you would need to know that so the experiment will be the same they should also include the amount of vinegar that you need the last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container
in order to replicate the experiment i will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers also i would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment and finally i need to know if it is weighed in grams pounds or any other measurement
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers you would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container the last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time
the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment the amount of vinegar to put in the containers the different samples they used needs to be stated in procedures and the amount of the sample placed in the container
you would need to add observations you would also need to add the time on the table
the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers you would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar you will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water
in order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble limestone wood and the plastic pour the vinegar into their containers place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours may be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same
there is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment first i would need to know what the four different samples are second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers third i would need to know what type of container i should use last i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours these are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment
the other information i would need to replicate this experiment is what do we use for the samples how much each samples do we use and how do we determine the mass of each sample
after reading this groups procedure i found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup this information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure coulnt be replicated therefore it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment
the first thing that i would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment is my 4 different samples the next thing i will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing i need is a slaceal to measure the start mass g and the ending massg to find out the difference in massg
i guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht like allow to dry in 30 min 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers 3 go over to make sure nothing goes wrong
the students need to include what the samples were you cant do an experiment if you dont know what youre testing on the students should also include the temp that the containers were stored at for 24 hours lastly they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container they couldve put the same amount or different amount they couldve put little or a lot
the addition information that i would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data what is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container i would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample
in order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the ph of the vinegar how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used ie balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic
to replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use you need to know how large the samples are and you need to know why you are doing the experiment
if trying to replicate this experiment you would need more information you need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers you will also need to know what to label your container how do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the materials your using this procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar
the students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples they also didnt specify how much of each sample they also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went
some additional information thats needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names kinds of each sample the measurements of each sample poured into the containers and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well
some information that is missing that they dont say what size of containers and they dont say what to do with data
in order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used and if it is the same for all of them you would also need to do another trial as the extra information would validate the experiment more
to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vineger is being poured in i would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container weather or not all of it or half of it should be added
to tell the amount vinger you pour into the container the size of the container ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water how many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass
this procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials first it has to say to put on their eye protection it also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples lastly there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results
1say what you are trying figure out in the first place p 2its not enough into figure out what is going on p 3we need to know more clearly how to do each step
first i would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need a hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out
in order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup they also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed if there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid
they did not tell us what to measure with they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers
in order to replicate this experiment i would also need materials i would use i would need the amount of vinegar in the container and i would also need time limit to do the test
some information i would need to know is how would the water be if
to replicate this experiment i would need to know more information i would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen also i dont know how much vinegar to pore in each cup this procedure also should specify what materials to use line what brand of cups or size
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers they also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample
first they should list the samples they used marble limestone wood and plastic in their procedure they should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect they should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet as a refrigerator or somthing not just leaving it out of their processes
in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp by hour bic its recorded after a 24 har period you would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins
to add to the experiment design the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables following this you will
additials information that would be good to now is why are the students performing this xpirement why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts or vinegar amounts you should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar i would get different results
you will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water you will probably need more of a little bit of everything
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass which would be a triple beam balance you would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3 you would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are those samples would be marble limestone wood and plastic
in order to replicate the groups experement i would need the following information  what  the 4 samples  are how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample
the information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis secondly they need to list all objects they used lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis waswasnt correct
the group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control in the experiment procedure also doesnt put the different samples of four like marble limestone wood plastic the purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time
to replicate the experiment  you would need to know the size of the containers the amount of each material to start with and the amount of vinegar used
i would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container how long to rinse it in water materials and what kind of container casinial use
in order to replicate this experimentyou must also know how much vinegar goes in each container how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours what type of climate
to duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate
the additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples i also need to know how much vinegar is needed furthermore i need to know the amount of each sample needed finally this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample
to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time
their are three things wrong with this procedure one is they did not table the four identical containers the second is they need to tell how much vinegar is needed the third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water
to replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed
one piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit and lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark
you will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container after the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse have the samples sit and dry for 30 min
additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled
you would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass and the information to which material to use in step 3
three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment first is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples the next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment  factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment
this experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same
the information the students left out was the control the control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples
additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar also the experiment  doesnt  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar
after reading this procedure i think it would need task needed tell what it is you are doing and what solution and a hypothesis
the first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing ie the procedure to gather materials this lets people know what materials your using also this procedure wasnt worded clearly like 2 pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers that makes no sense and is hard to understand they also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples
the additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used
they didnt include the temperature of the containers they didnt have trials of testing
you would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry
the group should be more specific including the names of the samplesadd rain sample12etc they should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2 in step 4 they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass also i need to know what should i do with the containers once ive labeled them the experiments results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them you dont know what to do lastly how much water should i rinse the samples with if different amounts are used the weight could differ
if i a just looking  at the people and i was to repeta this experiment  i would need to know what the four different samples  were  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples
to replicate this experiment the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use the procedure is very vague a scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment therefore the students should specify the marble limestone wood  plastic they should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used
in order to replicate this experiment the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group the experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed and if it was rinsed with cold hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature they were kept at also what was the group  investigating in should be included
how much vinegar you pour into the cups what kind of vinegar you usewhat kind of containers you should use
to make this procedure repeatable we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with otherwise we couldnt even start the experiment we would also need to know how much vinegar in ml to pour in the cups
to replicate the experiment i would need additonal information for example how much vinegar should be poured into each container i would also want to know the size of each sample and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible lastly i would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with with this information i am certainly capable of repeating the experiment
after reading the groups procedure i was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring all they tell us is vinegar also what is the size of the containers how much of each sample is being poured into the container the group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment
i think from reading the procedure they shouldve added information describing the look before and after see if there were any physical changes if something was to change then the group shouldve got it down so we know the features of the items
after reading the groups procedure to replicate this experiment i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate they would also need to include the four samples names marble limestone wood and plastic so i know what everything what everything is so i can create a data table they would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances i would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in
more information is needed more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion not many materials are listed
3 pieces of information i would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours i choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment
i would still want to know what they were doing this experiment how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples
in order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research
you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldnt use a stronger or weaker ph level you would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant
the additional information you need to replace the experiment you need limestone wood and plastic marbles you test all of them in different containers it will give you the mass of the experiment that is what it need to replace the experiment
how much of the material did they put into each container was there a controlled part of this experiment did they conduct a graph for this experiment
i would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure
in the procedure it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample finally additional information that should be added would be telling where to keep these samples where its cold room or hot temperature
how much vinegar would you pour in each cup what temperature would the samples be inwould it be the same or would it be different how would also need to know if they used the same size cup these things are all very important information that wasnt included
the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers do they want us to use you would need a sample of each of the substances as well as knowing what type of each substance you need last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers which changes the mass of each sample
some additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar size of the containers and the temperature
in order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known also the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated all of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment
in order to replicate this experiment more information is needed for example there has to be clear statement of problem this procedure doesnt explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment
the additional information it would need would be the
to replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with you will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do
some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water you could also add  how much vinegar  you add another thing to add would be a list of possible samples
something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials this insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start second make the sets easier to understand step 3 is very hard to interpret lastly make sure you clean up them at the end
first i would need to know what they used to determine the mass it would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure in case there was no data table present they could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them so i would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter i would also need to no how much of each material to use
i believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
to replicate their experiment i would need to have take their their procedure and use them i would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment all these need are the true basics
to replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didnt receive the treatment and in this case didnt receive the vinegar needs to be more clear it says pour vinegar into a container but its not specific as to how much vinegar also how much of the sample that will be used isnt stated
in order to replicate this expiriment you would need to know how much vinegar you should distribute into the container how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing how much of the each material you need
to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material samples were marblelimestoneacid and plastic you would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams if these three were added to the procedurethen you could replicate the experiment
to replicate the expirement i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample
to me i think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working
i would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as ml where do i put the cups in the sun or refridarter where do i let the samples dry in the open or the outside
after reading the groups procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container how much distilled water each sample was washed with and the size of the containers
after reading the group  procedure the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedurehow much vinegar should i pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface we would have  more contact with  the vinegar ending it right   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used
to replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container it would also put what effect of materials its going to use
in order to replicate this procedures you would need to know
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were also step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific they might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate
addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers another thing that would be needed is the types of racks because the grap didnt specify the different samples in the procedure the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after for example they could have said to measure it in grams
in order to replicate the experiment after reading you will need to know what the 4 different samples are you will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container you will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours
additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down
i would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers what kind of  lime and plastic like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in
some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples  how much vineger do you have to pour into each container and how many trials are needed to get more accurate data we need those information to know how to do this experiment
my opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table
you need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change also backround information is important to any experiment
in order to repeat this lab exactly as they did i would need to know what materials id need for example the marble wood limestone plastic was not writen in the procedure
in order for you to replicate the experiment you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything lastly i would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer
in this procedure the group calls the materials samples instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart when they just say samplesthat can mean anything in step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials
after you determine the mass of the products go back and see of your thesey was correct then go and daght a lab report about qv then when your done hand it qn
in order to replicate the experiment for acid rain you need  additional information first you need to know what type of samples your using second the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be having different sizes might change the results lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results
the additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samplesalso they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample  finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in  whether this was the same for each sample these additional steps  details would help create accuracy  consistency for all who completed the experiment
i think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be anther is they didnt put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses
some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar in order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it you also have to do some math to get the difference in mass
to repeat in experiment doing the group procedure i would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container another information
to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup i would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained
i would need to know how much samples i need for this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i am pouring into each container also i would need to know if i am letting the samples dry in the sun or not without these i could not replicate this experiment
i would need to know how much vinegar was used how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass
more you could repete the expierement just see it
first the experiment needs to have  a controll they need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials second they need more than one trial for each material i suggest three so you recieve better data the third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample
the limestone have mass than all of them
you would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar distilled water and some other materials
in order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers you would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same finally you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours
to replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for we would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup we would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying and we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar
we would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup also we would need to know how much or each sample to use and which materials we would also need a control so would need to place something in regular water as well
this experement didnt have a controle and the grupe didnt do multiple triles you would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is
you will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them
some additional information thats needed in this experiment acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc ways this experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish this experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel
in order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicatedlastly the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included
to replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar to your in each identical container you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes after 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
in order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container where they stored the containers for 24 hours and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes
some additional information would include the amount of vinegar poured into each container mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours
the procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it also you do not know what the four samples are in the second step how much vinegar should be poured in the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable a last step should  also be included to say repeat
after reading the procedure i would need to know the materials the students are using i would also need to know why they are doing the experiment what is the purpose what kind of containers are they using and how big are they
additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours how the samples should be dried and lastly with what should the masses be taken on
for one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure they also should state to use the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate finally the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment
you would need to state that wood didnt lose any mass the plastic lost 1 of mass the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 13 mass then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass
in order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included one thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container if there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily another thing they would have included is a control without a control there is nothing to compare your results to one last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used if you use more of one sample than another then of course it is going to way more each sample should be the same size
the students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in are they all solids in the same shape or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples also they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same what type of vinegar it is should also be included
a hypothesis was needed in this experiment also the group should had told the reader what was happening why the experiment was taking place also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate
additional things a i would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry
you would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted what results where they looking for you should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
you would need 1 more trials 2 different types of samples and 3 maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins
the additional info i would need to replicate it is marble limestone wood plastic water container vinegar label
the group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure they need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container the group also does not tell you how to way each samples mass
limestone you would need because its the most important of then it wont work when you used it
they need to repeat every step that already preformed
in order to replicate this groups procedure i would need the following information p 1 when they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples they should name and list the samples that they plan on using p 2 in step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in p 3 when they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water how much water should we use and how long should we rinse
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample you would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer
in order to replicate the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure how big the four identical containers were how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment how much vinegar and the students pour into each container
the iddtional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are the followingwhat changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs and the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegarwe pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation what did we learn
in order to replicate the groups experiment there is additional information that would need to be known such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample
in order to do this experiment again you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for
some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers if i did not have the data table i would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are it would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used in order to replicate on experiement the procedure must be precise and not have any information out or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the quanity of the variables sample materials it is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w distilled water use were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water mostly evapoltantiy i need to know how they determined the mass of the samples what was their tool of measurement
in order to repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined  due to the sorroundings it was in
you would need a control to look back on you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right with the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials
what was the purpose for them doing this experiment p why did they choose to set up there lable this way p and for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that theres no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions
it doesnt tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation so we would be able to do the work but i would know what we did if for after
if there is a control they would need to identify it they should also tell the type of material tell the mass unit of measurement
additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into  also although indicated in the data table the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in should it be poured limestone a block of wood etc and also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end all of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment
you should in all procedures out in an actually experiments
one step that missed was to gather all all the materials another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape
in addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples
after reading the groups procedure i think they should have added record the data get materials observe the expariment and repeat expariment
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information i could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa
i would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes also i would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that i have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples
they should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor
the additional information that i would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples
after reading the groups procedure some good additional information would be what the containers are made of the dependent variable and the dependent variable
first off id need to know maybe the material of each sample
in this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container this may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples i also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass
this group is lacking a control group in their procedure also they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers next the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1
first i would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container also i would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would be stored in over the 24 hour period p lastly i would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids
in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know how much volume or mml you would need to pour into the containers also you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containersnothing b messed up in the experiment and step 5 does not explicate how to d it does the experiment want the containers to have the same area it does not explicate
there are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it first step 1 says determine the nose of four different samplesthey should have said what the samples were of second step 2 says pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar third there is no control in this experiment they should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control
additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to pour into each container it should say what each sample is in the procedures a list of materials
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how big samples to use you would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment  the groups procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in g to specify which samples were being used marblelimestonewood of plastic and specify the size and type of the containers used beakers
additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers should i buy the materials or use natural resources
if i has to replicate the expinment i would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign also how do you determine the mass
this information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment p amount of vinegar poured p identify types of samples used in the procedure p temperature and p size of containersopenclosed lid
after reading this procedure i would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand in order to replicate this experiment you would need to label what material is going into the container what youre labeling it and what single sample enters the container in the end also to make this experiment more reliable you would need to add more trials to your procedure also if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table you would need to identify the four samples in step one
one thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger also they should have a hypothisis
you would need to add materials that you need to use you also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups you should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like a b c d
in order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers you would need to use some sect of measuring material like a scale to know the affects of vinegar on the material you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass
to replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it
in the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example the could say determine the mass of 4 different rock samples i also think they say sample too many times you get confused about what they are saying one last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container
where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment  why do you need vinegar where does the acid come from
after reading this groups procedure i think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone also i think they should have one more trials
in order to replicate this experiment i would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so i dont put in too much or too little i would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly if i had only looked at the groups procedure i would need to know what four samples the students used so that i could replicate the experiment and then i would need to know where the containers were kept so i could give mine the same amount of light and other things
after reading the groups procedure i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed first the procudere doesnt state what is being tested we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we havent been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers lastly we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container
the additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples which is the marble limestone wood and plastic the information that is needed is the starting and ending mass
in order to replicate this experiment the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples if not then a person might use any different mass samples also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers to make this procedure replicateable the group would have to make these change
three pieces of additional information that i would need are as follows first how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers secondly how large should the samples be the last thing i would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be
to replicate this experiment i would also need to know in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment
after reading the groups procedure in and for me to replicate this experiment i would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for me knowing these three additional sources of information i could successfully replicate this experiment
to replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them
you would need to know what the four different samples are also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers lastly you need to know what temperature to store them at
the groups procedure was pretty vague there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar and how large the samples are also each sample should be named in the procedure like determine the mass of marble limestone wood and plastic samples should be stated in the procedure
to repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples
just based off of the procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount youd also need to know what in use as a container as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result youd also need to know the starting mass of each sample and what the samples are
well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water three pieces of information limestone plastic marble
after reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour also they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment
some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment first of all the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment marble limestone wood and plastic they also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar and type of vinegar that needs to be put in each cup the procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials
you would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material for example plastic could
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers a third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak all of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment
information i would need p  what do they want to find out in other words their implied aim p  the amnt of vinegar p  the amnt of sample
to be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things for example do they want us to use the same materials of course they do so thats one another is what kind of containers do they want us using we can use plastic or metal or another lastly you would need to know how much distilled water that you need
in order to deplicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the people used if we dont know and we use more or less it could change the experiments outcome also  we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones and finally it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours
one additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar in ml is needed to pour into the containers every container needs the same amount of vinegar the other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else you would miss the point the third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in they all need the same unit and balance
to repeat this expirement i would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be
in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated
what they missed was the samples that they were pouring the vinegar on they need to have every piece of information in the procedure so other people can do this job
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass because if we put a different amount were going to get a different result
one thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u usefor example the whole object half the object also if they were making a table what information do u need to record
pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers p after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water p placing a single sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl
you would need starting mass ending mass and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment
to replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time also do a graph showing the difference in weight we need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one
nsr
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to pouring i  sample into more than just one container instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes let it dry for hour
how to extract the materials from the vinegar what conditions would the materials be drying ex sunny warm place or dark cold place what conditions would the material be soaking in temp light ext 
you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups that way you would get more accurate results
you would need to know how much vinegar to use what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment
to replicate this experiment the following information is needed the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given in this experiment to much or to little virner may be used there should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in and the labeling  may not be the right label the experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with
in order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass
after reading the groups procedure some information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water also i would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup lastly you would need to do multiple trials for reliability
some additional information i would need would include what objects to determine the mass of also to replicate this procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container seeing as the group doesnt give an exact amount i would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with finally their procedure doesnt tell exactly how to determine the mass
the procedure should include what the four different samples are at this point it is to vague and needs to be specified the procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers the procedure should also encourage repetition human and equipment errors as always possible therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary finally the procedure does not include a control this doesnt give the readers anything to compare the results
the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble limestone wood and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each what material did you use to get this answer what effects did it have on all material such as color and size
1 i would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample p 2 what are they trying to find out through pass is to amount p 3 was there a control group in this experiment
you would need to know how big of cups to use how much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get
some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh so they are all equall what type of container should the sample be put into how should i determine the mass of the different samples how much vinegar to pour into the samples
in order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use for amount of marblelimestone and wood water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material
to exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with
you need something like a scale to determine the mass determine the mass of four different samples you need to identify what that sample you also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed
determine the mass of four samples of what how much vinegar is needed in the containers you would need a scale to measure the different containers are the different containers made of the same material
you would need to know the amount of vinigar they added what kind of containers and how much or how big each object is
in order to replicate this experiment the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with as well as how they determined the mass of the samples lastly they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers
there are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be these would help because will not them you dont know which samples you are supposed to use and if theyre not all the same across you could get invalid results also they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else once again there is a risk of the data being invalid
some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers the actually samples they use  marble limestone wood plastic and how you would measure the mass of each sample
the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers how much vinegar is put in each of the containers and how much of the sample is in each container in the procedure they dont say what was in each of the containers they also didnt say how much vinegar that they put into the containers lastly they didnt say how much of the sample was in the containers they needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment
you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment
i would need to know several things before replicating this job first i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container also i would need to know what i should do to determine the mass of the samples lastly i would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers i should use
i would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isnt it poisoning to humans
to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately also the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment also in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen
in order to replicate the experiment i would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in secondly i need to know on what i should place the samples on to allow them to dry lastly to replicate the experiment i need to know the control group and the type of container i should use also it would be necessary to know what i should weigh the samples on
in order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in  how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off
in order to replicate the experiment you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated you would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical a third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them in the procedure the samples identities are not given
additional information they could have added is mass the weight of vinegar poured into the samples they also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used also they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out
additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do i pour into each container also i would need to know the control of the experiment so i could see what changed and how i also need to know what i should use to measure the mass they only say nreeus the mass in their experiment they never told me specifically what to measure it with
more information would be needed to replicate the experiment it needs to be explained what the samples are of it should say how much vinegar to use also it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar there should be a control included within the experiment directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass
use the same material that is used for the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific it would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with it is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles
i would need to know what the samples were
in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much of the samples to use how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be
why they even did it is in the first place and what am i wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would i get the supplies i needed and if theres anything that i shouldnt use in this experiment
the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is a watch a measureing container also some marbles limestone wood and plastic
to repeat this experiment again you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers the volume could each have to be equal to get the best results next you would want to know the volume of the containers so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment you have the same results last you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used and the volume of the samples so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar
in order to replicate this groups experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
one extra piece of information that i would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass i would also need to know what the four different samples were in addition i would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used
the additional information that should be included in this procedure is how much vinegar goes in each sample where do the samples go to sit and dry at label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the groups hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect this will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar lastly i would need to see results from a controlled experiment such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay
there are several pieces of information that i would need to replicate this experiment firstly in step one i would want to know specifically what the four different samples were secondly in step two i need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers thirdly in step three i would need to know how much of each material to put into each container having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent all three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating
the three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows
i would have to check the mass of four different samples put vinegar in each one of the separate containers put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone wood and plastic while waiting 24 hours i would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers you would also need to know what the materials are that youre putting into containers you also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are all these things are essential to replicating this experiment
information i would need to replicate i mass 4 samples should i
same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container i would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesnt talk about acid rain once
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know p  1 how much vinegar to put in each container p  2 how much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water temperature of water as well p  3 what temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying p  4 how big the containers are p  5 what environment is the experiment taking place in hot warm freezing wet etc
after reading the groups  procedure the group should add a hypothesis controll and objective
after reading the procedure to their experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar to use what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with and what are the fair samples suppose to be
the procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed  it also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table
the procedure is very flowed because i cant even understand half of it when they are talking about the four samples they need to clarify what the samples are they also need to clearly give the distinction of the container the samples and where viniger is poured into lastly they need to not write step 3 because the container sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig
any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples thats mass are being determined where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water
a couple more things i would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly lastly i would also i would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end
they didnt mention how much vinegar to put in the containers this could effect the mass of the object at the end they should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are
pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical containers after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rocks masses how much vinegar youre putting the rocks in  finally you need to know how much of each sample youre putting in a container
first you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup second you will need to know the temperature of the room third you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal
additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would include what the sample materials i was using were what kind of result am i looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that i am suppose to attempt to solve it would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed whether it be in the sun or in the dark by knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible
one thing they could have that they dont is a control of this procedurethe next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building materialthe final thing is that i think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals
i would like to know what the experiment is for  what are the measurements for all this how much vinegar in each container 
to make this experiments procedure completethree additional things are needed first the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification second the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers finally all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier these additional steps would make the procedure better
additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials also other info would be what size containers do you need for this experiment lastly does it matter the material of the container glass metal throw away containers
to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the students goal was i always label how much of an amount to put into a container in their procedure its that the students did not do this
i would needed to know what different samples to find the mass how much starting mass i would need and how to measure the ending mass without these three pieces of information i would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly
i would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry also i would need to know where i should place a sample lastly i would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white apple material also i would need to know how top measure the mass
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container you will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample and what the samples actually are of what material
the students need a list of materialalso the students should write that we have to form a hypothesisthe students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh you would also need to know what four samples to use also to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need some additional informationi would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container
the additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesnt say which samples to use in the procedure you would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass you would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didnt have a large difference in mass
in step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container after step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed
there is something missing in the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers what it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added but there is no mention of how much to add
i would need to know what to measure the weight in how much vinegear to put in and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for
while i would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors how to get the starters mass of each sample between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it
if you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel and tell the size of each of the samples
we would need to know 1 the four types of sample mentioned in  2  would need to be classifiedtemperature of vinegar 3 type of wood plasticetc they usedand 4 the amount of vinegar they poured into each container
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use one would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container also the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this
step one really should go at the end you need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it i would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph
in order to adequately replicate this experiment one would need more specific samples for example instead of wood it should be a specific type of wood marble limestone or plastic the procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours
you would need the independent varible that never changes to replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers also how did the mass reacted to the substance
one thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar and lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for days weeksit never tells you this information it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things
first off you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain also to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again the person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours more water and vinegar would be needed too
to replicate the experiment the students need to include more detail in their procedure first we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment the students tell us to pour vinegar into containers however it is not clear how much vinegar to use if the amounts of vinegar are different the entire experiment will not be accurate to improve the experiment the students could have done more trials to get better observations
i would need to know how
one thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers
in order to replicate the experiment i need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers i need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other
additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is to whether i should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period also i would need to know if i should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area i would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use it doesnt state it clearly
you would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain you would also need to know what type of materials you need another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar addedthe stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more you would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours whether they were placed at cool temperature hot or cold
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each containeryou need to know the 4 different samples what to do with the difference in masses what do the difference in the masss tell you
this procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in gramsthey gave foour different samples but they didnt include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samplesthe purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples
first off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers  also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do
the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material and the third thing is they need a controlled
to replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups
you would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container allowing students to record the correct data
the additional information i need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container what kind of container am i supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object
if i replicated this i would also need what i uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
in order to replicate this groups experiment i would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container also i would need to know what type of marble limestone wood and plastic was used finally i would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use what it should be able to hold how much vinegar to pour into each container  how many ml  what type of vinegar what to weigh the samples on bathroom scale or type of beam balance maybe electronic
the procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first it should include measurements we need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample second the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals
to replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions record your data
in order to replicate this procedure they should includ a set mass for each stone ie 10g of each sample they also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container
i would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesnt say in the procedure i would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container i would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water
in order to replicate the experiment i would need other than the procedure what samples to use what materials how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in these pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain finally the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours
the group needs to include each specific in their conclusion the amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container the group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample the table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure
you may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in explain how you found the differences in mass mass before you rinse with the distilled water
in the procedure the group should have included what samples they were going to use marble limestone wood plastic the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup it would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately
the students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items they would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container it is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water
you wouldnt need any information they provide you with all the information you need they tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart
additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples inthis doesnt tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially coveredthe starting mass of limestone was 98g the ending mass was 94g that was a  04g difference the experiment doesnt tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegarthis is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment
what are the four samples are what kind of materials you would need are tgoing out a hypothesis
to replicate the experiment i would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass how much vinegar do i pour in each of the four samples and am i doing all four at the same time so they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time
in order for me to replicate this groups experiment i need to know what type of sample am i weighing i need to know how much vinegar am i pouring in the containers i also need to know what i am labeling on containersand what das i use to remove samples from the containers
some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the groups
you would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment one would be how much vinegar to pour into the container another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ a third piece of information needed would be what samples to use also if they should all start out with the same mass or not
the additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container i also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours  inside outside by a window 
one piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal i would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours ex shadesun lastly i would need to know what kind of container should be used a plastic a covered or a dark container etc
in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know what the sample was a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution vinegar that should be applied for each sample having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the 4 different materials are that id be testing in addition i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample finally i would need to know that i was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples otherwise i would be missing my dependent variable
to replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash
you need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle
1 have a determined size for the starting samples of rock p 2 determine an amount of vinegar p 3 determine what type of containers are being used
you will need to know which rock had the most mass which one had the least and which one was the same
in order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers how much water you rinse the containers with where it is being dried and how to measure the mass grams doundsetc
i would include the materials used or the samples also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing masing and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup
additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in how big the container should be and if the material should be or shouldnt be fully submerged by the vinegar
one piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment you also need to know what youre supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem it doesnt say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample i would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so i could compare results of the samples lastly i would need to know if the experiment was completed
include the name of the samples in the procedure p say how do students measure the mass p ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion
the procedure never states what the samples areit  needs to add the four samples marbleslimestonewood and plastic into the first stepthe procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measuredthe procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the students are looking for why each steps of the procedure is being done why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions  in order to create more accurate data
the additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be
after reading the groups procedure there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment first they didnt state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor second in order to make sure their experiment was valid they could have done another trial and lastly they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results
in order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples the second thing you need to know is what temperature the room is when you start the experimentthe last step is write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record
in order to replicate this experiment the group would need some additional information in their procedure an example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance they need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container or how big the sample is or what the sample is its very vague so they should add more specific
i would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was i trying to find in order to replicate the experiment
to replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cupsthis would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples say what sample to use in the experiment too
to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers even though the samples are listed in the chart the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure
the  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container what to label the containers or what materials to put in the containersthey also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals
after reading the groups procedure i think that in order to replicate these experiment i will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer
the additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using you need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you dont then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change you also need a control group
to tell me what the samples are in the procedure p how much vinegar to pour in the four containers p where and at what temperature are they putting them in
the biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide another problem is that they didnt mention how much vinegar should be used the group wasnt very specific for example they didnt say what temp the samples should be kept at by not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid
after you remove the containers you rinse them  see what results you get in about so minutes
you would need to know the conditions of the sample p you would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics p you would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types p you would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar
to be able to replicate the expariment you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure it doesnt show the samples in the procedure and if i was to do the expariment without the other groups data there is no way i could without knowing the samples
i would need vinegar 4 containers labels time 24hours a sink 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale
a person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under all of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know
in order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature
after reading the groups i would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment i would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects  also what kind of container to use
i would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs 2 i would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did 3 i would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself
one idea they might need to use is to say what four materialssabstones are being used in your procedure also they should be sure to use a control in this experimentmissing the group should also  used more than one trial to their experimentlab
you would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container so the results are accurate you would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at
in my experiment  i would include steps p 1 gathering materials p 2 observation of the substances p 3 making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water
to repercat this experiment i would need to knew how vingnr what is the controy and what are the samples
the group will need
if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure p 1how big should the rock samples be p should they be relatively the same size p 2 how much vinegar should be poured into the containers p 3how long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water p 4should the containers be made out of any specific material
if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar and what temperature to keep the experiment drying
i would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers i would need to know what the four containers contained since they are the samples being used in the experiment and what to use to determine the mass of them
to replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using how much vinegar you should put in each container and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples
the person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container what type of container they used plastic metal glass etc whether or not the person would need gloves tongs and other utensils you will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after
in order to replicate this expirement you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement  compromising the results
additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured the ph level of th vinegar  and much of the sample was added into the vinegar
to replicate the experiment i would need the materials to replicate the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers to replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it 
i would need to know what the samples were of how much vinegar what containers what material  how much of that material
i would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container i also would need to know how many trials were their in addition i would need to know what type of vinegar was used
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples i would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers and what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container also you would need to how to determine mass not to mention you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry
after reading the groups procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about
they could have told us the amount of vinigar used what they used to make the distilled water and the could have explained how to rinse the material i we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them
the group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible
to replicate the experiment i would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials i would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal because there are many diffrent
these other pieces of information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do i obtain marble limestone wood and plastic since there as the of materials
in order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given one of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples was it with a triple balance scale etc another piece of information explained is how long each sample was finally in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used
additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of containers to use how much vinegar and
one would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence
my first piece of information would be a bar graph then i would give specific directions on what i did but i would make it clear so other people can easily do it to then i would write a conclusion why this prblly happened
i would write what
in order to replicate this experiment there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need first you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need finally you need to know the mass of the cups so you dont mix up the sample weight thats the information you need to replicate this expiriment
it should say how much vinegar they use in each container it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each
to replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials in step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used step six should be changed to after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass
you would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample different amounts of vinegar would give different results youd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used
i would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass i would need to know what sample materials im using in the procedure and i would need to know how many trials i would need to do
you will need a solution results and a conclusion
from this experiment i would need to know how big each of the containers are i would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container if i was to replicate this experiment i would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers
to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar to poor i would have to know whatknd of samples to use
the additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container after 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry the additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference
you would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin
in order to replicate this experiment the groups procedure should include more specific information they should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples they should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled this will make the procedure easier to follow it would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers
one additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment also between steps 1 and 2 there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate but identical containers
how much vinegar is needed in each dish what is the sample material and how do you determine the mass
in order to replicate this experiment i would need the size the four containers are what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is and how much vinegar the students poured into each container
after reading the group experiment i belive that they will need multipule trials they also need a control what type of container how much vinager also what you would use to find the mass
to replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at and you need to know how much vinegar
in order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that i can make sure some of them gets the same amount also i would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples by using a balance or scale etc finally i would need to know if the containers were closed or not because that environmental factor could change the results of anmytheir experiment
in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used second they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar lastly to repllcate this experiment you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material so the all came out equal you would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment
to replicate this i would need much more information as to sizes of samples also there should be more specific size measurements of the containar lastly they never say how much vinegar to use p all of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment
according to the data that the students recorded the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience i would  never backround hypothesis graft counclution problem materials i think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment
the three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments
the procedure is unclear in order to effectively replicate this experiment i would need to know what the four samples that are needed were i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container it would help to know how  large each container was as wellp1vinegar amount 2 types of sampling 3 containers size
the first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers how much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
you have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure some additionally needed information would be in step 1 what measurement are you having the mass in g kg in step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers for example 10ml another thing is in step 3 what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify lastly in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in
after reading the groups procedure additional information ii would need in order to replicate the experience is 1 choose 4 different samples to work with 2 instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form 3 and finally instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min
after reading the groups procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is how i can determine the mass the materials i am working with how identical the containers have to be
to be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers what type of scale to use to determine the mass also the type of container needed
to repeat this experiment you would need a list of materials
in step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers
some additional information i would need is i would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers i would also need to know what the samples are to replicate the experiment i would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else
to replicate this i need to know what samples im working with it doesnt tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups if says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers where do they go for 24 hours
in order to replicate the experiment  it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples to the different samples were listed in the procedure it would be betterunderstand it would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegars effect on the mass of the samples it would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container
the additional information i would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples it is well specified also i need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers then after the experiment is complete i would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container the four different samples mass of them and where they were put is stated but not how much vinegar was put into the containers
to replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic you would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose youre testing
i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use also they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know many details first i would need to know what samples i am using in order to find their mass i also would need to know how large each material is this way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how large the material was also i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount last i would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water
in order to replicate the experiment the groups procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be infor example the temp of the room
you would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample
you would need to know the amount of vinegar needed the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water
the additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble limestonewood and plastic
at the start of the procedure we would need to know what four samples we were testing otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment we also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers we finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in plastic glass we need to know this as well
additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given
this experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment they should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass
three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is 1 to know how much vinegar to use 2 what is the control if any and 3 do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  periodor do you just leave them uncovered
if this experiment was going to be repeated a control  would need to be used instead of using vinegar the materials would be placed in water also the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material the amounts should be equal to balance it out changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment
some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in they need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis
to make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it i would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1 ake what are its materialscontainers cant in step 3 and finally i would need to know what to measure the samples with what kind of units
i would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass they didnt keep track of the experimentp they also didnt repeted the experiment again and i think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do
i think they should also  put why are they doing it i mean what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature volume how  ro the samples in a determined place etc
addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid
in order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in also wt kind of container the labels title and the device used to measure the mass
how much do you pour in the containers
they also should watch how all the samples change and take notes see if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they then see how it changes during the day
in order to replicate the experiment you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container you should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar lastly you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out
in order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more how much of  each sample material needed and how much vinegar you should pour into each container by having this information the lab will be more accurate and correct
the additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar which may have represented acid rain with a ph of 32 was put into each sample since p there were different masses of the given samples eg marble 98g whereas wood 112g p the ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled p the mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
after reading this procedure i have noticed that i would need to know the ph of the vinegar also i would need to kno how much vinegar is needed lastly it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent
in order to replicate the experiment they should say what temperature to keep the room at they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results and also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in because if one sample is bigger than another that will also change the results
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need to know the samples being used how much vinegar to use and also what to lable without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesnt include all the information needed
the students should state what the four different samples are state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye
three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are how much vinegar is needed to be poured how long do you rinse the containers for what do you measure the mass in
in order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers so there is an even amount in each container another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass
i would need to know what kind of samples to use how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment
in order needs say the information
pour the same amount of vinegar on all four after you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it
after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be that is the only thing they would need to do
the students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed they also didnt say what the four samples were the students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing
as you can see the students investigation went well the materials they used were marble limestone wood and plastic by look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 98marble 104limestone 112wood 22plastic then the end mass read 94marble 91limestone 112wood and 71plastic as you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased as you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together so i believe as i have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results
after reading the groups procedure i have determined they could add what four different samples you are using during the experiment the group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers the temperature at which the samples are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined
in order to replicate this experiment the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment
for the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information which is starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass the items are marble limestone wood and plastic then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment
i will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24 24 hours i remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after i determine the mass of each sample
additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers the size of the containers themselves and how long i would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger
they should add how much vinegar to pour into the container and how large the container must be as well another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100 or 50 or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume
to replicate this experiment i will need to say thatlist what will be the material going inside the container p i will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials
you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not
the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container and also the site of the container needed for this experiment
they should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container they should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container they need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know a saw things i would need to know how much vinegar they used what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used
how much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples they should have said how much water to rinse each sample with also could you try different liquids
take an hypothesis of what masses theyll have analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem
the additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup i would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself i would need to know how big each individed
the students left out some important information in the procedure like how much vinegar should be put into the cups if we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment where should the samples dry warm cold in the sun
packet in fat it dont make no sense
to replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers you would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use
some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
in order to replicate this experiment i would need a hypothesis the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid i would need i would do the experiment the same way so i would also need to know what kind of container to use i would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended
in order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be includedin step 2 the size of the container must be includedfor step the units being used used to be stated
the additional info that you need is a control how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used
the first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar they didnt go into enough detail on what their experiment is about
i would need to know how much of each material will be needed also i will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical lastly i must know where the containers were placed in the sun shade etc or my results may vary
additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment p  vinegar affects the mass of sample when it go inside  absorb p  temperature affects evaporation p  efficiency when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers that would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks and not the amount of vinegar also i may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list
the additional information i would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure find the average of the samples to find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container
i will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else they could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples
numbe one you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers
in the procedure the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers however the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added by not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students amount also there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found
you would need to know how much wood limestone marble and plastic you would need also how much vinegar to put in the container how long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water those are the information that you would need to do this experiment
the group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container in their procedure they also should have
if you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know p what the samples are  so you could use them p how much vinegar to put into the containers p what materials you need to gather without the above information you couidnt properly replicate the experiment
the procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using whether it be marble limestone wood or plastic last the procedure doesnt include a clear purpose why are they doing this experiment  is it nessecary what varaety do they receive from this
to replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting the students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested the final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass againdo everything you did already but start with the information you already havethen determine the mass you end up withand the difference in the mass thats how i would replicate the experiment
to replicate the experiment you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid they should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include lastly that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass
additional information that shouldve been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing couldve went wrong during at least one of the trials bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass
in order to replicate the experiment the groups procedure should mention which samples to use marble limestone wood and plastic it should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container and the size of the samples needed for testing
after you would rinse each sample it would be best to check the temporter how much vinegar where used and i would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment
in order to replicate the experiment we  would need to know  p 1 which kind of samples to use p 2  how much vinegar to add to each sample p 3 how much of each sample to use
limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood marble and plastic so this investigation is complete
there are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment first of all the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are so their names would have to be included in the first step additionally the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers finally the last step states to determine the mass of each sample but does not give a unit of measurement therefore it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams with this additional information one could now replicate the experiment
to replicate the groups experiment more information is neccesary the students should have included the material types instead of four different samples and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample container size
on the groups procedure some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass
they should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know which 4 samples to use then i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container which is very important finally i would need to know what to label each container in order to reciprocate this experiment exactly adding on i would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately
one piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container what the four samples are
some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar they should also say what the sample is
how much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for also the temperature the writer would be where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold hot areas
some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2 how much vineagar is needed the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded
information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used
1you will need on hypothesis p 2you will need a independent variable p 3you will need a dependant variable
after reading their procedure i dont even know what they are trying to do if it was my procedure i would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on i would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well
in order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are how much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers and what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample
after reading this group procedure some information that i would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid there would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what materials i needed what kind of sample and how much of it
i need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass
although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure in addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g the results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic the procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples
some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size how many containers and what size how much of the sample to put in the container
in order to replicate this experiment additional information is needed  first the amount of vinegar would be needed also the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities finally the temperatures of the room where the solutions sat needs to be known
you would need to give information on what the experiment is about
the first thing thing they did wrong was they didnt explain what their objective and investigation was about also they didnt compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass  they got information but it did not have any mention to it
this is a clear investigation of the acid rain  they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass
the procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in which would he grams as shown in the data table also what to measure them with it should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers and finally the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
in order to replicate the experiment additional information is needed you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container in step 3 you need to know what material you are putting in each container you also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in step 4
after reading the groups procedure i can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment first i would need to the materials needed for the lab i would need to get these items in ahead of time and have the right things like containers i would also need to know what kind of rocks were used if i was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure i would need to know what rocks were used a third thing the procedure hasnt told us is the amount of vinegar for this to be a valid experiment we would need to use the same amount of vinegar
they would need to state the four different samples that they are using they also could have done different trials of the experiment and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got
after reading the group procedure the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples the group does not say what they are also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container the group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample
additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar
in order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed the samples p need to be listed also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be p added in order to replicate the experiment another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass
in order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container i would also need to know what type of container i would even like
to replicate the experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container youd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly youd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min
i would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment
need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and iv and ov
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the brand of vinegar
the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock vinegar and distilled waterthese measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment the amount of rock is what is being tested the amount of vinegar is independent variable the amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away
the information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large
in this acid rain procedure it says to add vinegar into each container you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated give a start and stop time put safety googles on
some additional information i would include on the groups procedue would be to specify the types of samples from the first step also to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be the way the masses were measuredshould also be included along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain the place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well lastly they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar
this experiment p in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar put on the container the size of the samples id need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples what kind of container do i have to use
a good procedure would show a little more information such as  how much vinegar you pour into each container it should also tell the size and or type of containers used in this experiment also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults
firstly it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers
in order to replicate the groups procedure i would need some more information i would need to know what the samples were i would need to know the ph vuel of the vinegar and i would need to know if there was any control in the experiment
the sample is marble starting mass 98 ending mass 94 and difference in mass  04 the limestone sample starting mass 104 91 ending mass difference  04
in order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information first they need to specity what the
if i were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure i would need a little more information to make it accurate first of all you would need to know what the different samples were marble limestone wood and plastic i would also need to know that i had to measure the mass in grams and i would also need to know how much vinegar i need to pour in each cup
after reading the students experiment i would need to know what size containers how much vinegar for each sample the kind of sample and the mass of the sample
you would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample you should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample
to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials
the additional information i would need is how many trials theyre going to do also how much vinegar they have to por in each container another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you needgogglesgloves etc
some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples also since there is multiple varieties of plasticthey could state what kind of plastic they used
you would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed
the procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar ill be pouring into the containers also what kind of container ill be using when determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks
in order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container also what size container should be used another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container
in order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure one would need to know what the given materials are  one would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup without this information the results would be inaccurate in addition one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample this information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment
i would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples it is important to have them all be the same size i would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers the third piece of additional information i would need to know is how much much distilled water i should rinse off each sample with
the aditional informatiou i would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers you would also need to know how much marble limestone wood and plastic are needed in each container last you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold
before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples
you have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass
after reading the group procedure the additional information the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail what are they really trying to investigate also what are they actual trying to determine
the 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar
in order to replicate experiment i would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container how much of each sample to put in the container and
if i was going to repeat this experimen i would need to know 2 things about the vinegar i would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegarwhat type of plastic would i need what temperature would i put the samples soak in
after reading the groups procedure additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment ishow much vinegar was used how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry tinet paper towel in the sunetc
i believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didnt pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed
some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container the size or amount of each sample needed  the type of containers to hold each sample in
in this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them you may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours what would that do to the samples
to replicate this you would a hypothesis also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample you would not be able to retest this experiment this information one other thing you might need is a control for the experiment something to compare the results with
i would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if i have to use marble limestone wood and plastic and how much vineger to use i would also need to know is how big the container is
to replicate the experiment i would need the data the samples of the experiment and i would also need the equipment
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample also i would need to know how to mass the samples determine the mass is too vague sets no 4 finally i would need to know what type of containers to use plastic cups styrofoam covers p initial amount for each samples
the first starting mass was for wood 112g ending mass 112g and difference in mass 00g second was limestone with starting mass 104g ending mass 91g difference 13g third starting mass was marble 98g ending mass at 94g and difference in mass 04g last was plastic starting mass 72g ending mass 71g difference 01g
the group would need to table the date explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was this will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and day
some additional information how much vinegar do i pour into the cup wha sample materials are they useing how do i find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde
i would need the procedure the samples starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
additional information i would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container i would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment
after reading the groups proceduresome additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be p                               1 to know the amount of vinegar they used p                               2 to know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didnt label that p                               3 to know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container because that will effect the results and decrease validity
some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers what kinda of containers or size of container was each sample poured in to and finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water why couldnt they just leave it how it was
one piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers a second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything lastly i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment i should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that
after reading the groups procedure i think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time and what kind of containers did they use  beaker test tube a regular container 
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the samples two how big the pieces of rocks areif they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers do they need a lid to cover evaporation how large are they more specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here
3 place marble limestone wood and plastic into separate containers p 4 let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water p 5 allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes
the additional information i would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours and a problem statement said also be necessary
in this experiment the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure when it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers it doesnt tel me how much i should fill in them step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container it doesnt explain the sample also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples
first you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent next you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds
when simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accuratethey should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally by the same wage it is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar bc the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible
in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed the size of the container needs to be determined also the procedure just says four different samples it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers finally it doesnt say how long the sample should be rinced for if those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated
there is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot you need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup if you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct you should have the vinegar at a constant measurement
first you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container second you need a control for comparison purposes third you need to state the size of the containers
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant lastly it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples arent different because that could vary your results
the additional information that i would need to know how many of each individual sample i am fiding the mass for p they didnt say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample
additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many ms of vinegar would i pour into the four containers also i would need to know what material to put in each container i would also need to know the measurment
in the students procedure you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity also they should specify what type of container to put each sample in such as a test tube or a beaker the students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well so that when replicated the same samples will be used
in order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure the group needs to include the problem a hypothesis of what theyre testing materials they need to perform the experiment and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right the group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed
how much vinegar you will need to put in the container what is the control variable whats the dependent  and independent variable
what you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours and not any other time how you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min
in the experiment they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone the one that went down the most if the experiment was for an hour it would double
1 how much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment p 2 how much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment p 3 what should i use to determine the mass in my experiment
to successfully replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials i would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar the final piece of information i would need to know is how much distilled water i am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples
to make a hypothesis p after to make a conclution p determine if the investigation is good or bad
to replicate this experiment i need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining and the volume at the end of the experiment
i would need to know what the four different samples of material i was massing were i would need to know how much vinegar to add i would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found in the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment goggles hat
they need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container they need to tell like where they will place the containers if it has to be in warm place or room temperature they have actually determine the mass
to be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did i would need the amount of vinegar in each asp i would also need to know the environment around the samples for example the temperature they were left to sit in lastly i would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of sample material is needed how much vineagar to put in each container and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results
after reading the groups procedure i would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment for example i would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample then how much vinegar should be added to each container finally i would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment
to replicate this experiment i would need is know what type of sample i would need to measure the mass additionally i would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in also i would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment
you would need to know first the materials needed for the experiment then if the materials are listed it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure second you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance also you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples
what kind of containersbig small what are the samples they dont tell us what they are they could be anything you dont know there rocks until you look at the data tablein this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label what sample what material what containers and what are we supposed to label the sample or what is being put into
in order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions
to replicate this experiment you would need the following information you would need the amount of vinegar the students used you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the ph of the vinegar and the room temperature
a the group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample p b the size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment p c would need to know what materials to gather
i would need to know what are the samples like the ones they put in their table at other ones they dont state what the samples have to be   they also dont say how much should the samples weigh they also dont say how much vinegar should  be used  should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know the most important part of the experiment the samples i would use in the procedure the group does not say that you need marble limestone wood and plastic additional information i would need would be how much of each sample i would need because i may need a band or ocuple of ances and i would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample
this table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables its still missing the control group the indepent variable is the change in mass the purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples
the three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project and also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process
well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples they vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water
the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers
i would need to know how much vinegar was used i would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours lastly i would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used
additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started a final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate one important thing they need to mention in this procedure is what four different materials we are using
in order to replicate the experiment the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples otherwise the data can be affected without this constant also it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble limestone wood and plastic are the specific materials used this needs to be included in the procedure finally the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar dont affect the validity of the experiment
in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know first or all what each sample is they would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materialslastly they would need to know how many samples of each materialthe would need and the substance size
additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be what the sample are how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly how do i determine the mass of each sample in other words what type of measuring device do i use
to replicate this experiment first off i have to know which sample is which when recording the mass i will not know which belongings to the correct sample also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with so this needs to be clearer last of all in order to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers because different amounts of vinegar can change the results last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples but i do not know ways to remove those samples in a seperat cup or container
so additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
you would need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container you would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers in addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else
additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container if you do too much its or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data including record data would or additional information too because if it wasnt without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down
what is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also dont p forget about the control
in order for or to replicate the experiment the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each by showing all the data then youll be able to replicate the experiment
one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2 to pour into the containers another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3 a last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for in step 4
1 you need to know the amount of vinegar being added p 2 you need a controle group p 3 you need to know what your labeling each container
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to find the mass of the samples possibly using an electronic  balance i would also need to know how big of a container to use sometimes if you have a lot of vinegar the results will be different i would also need to know the purpose of the lab is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles
i would need to determine the mass of four different samples also place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hoursremove the samples frim the containers i would have to do the mass of grams for the samples
make sure to include at least three pieces of information samples have lost in for mation because iget information sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes p  because determine the mass of each sample
first would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested also how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not the acids on our fingers could affect the samples they should also describe how to figure out the mass the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass
to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use such as marble or plastic you would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample
the additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample
i think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment
some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need the size of the containers used in the experiment you would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period
some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar i would need to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is if i can use more than four samples
to replicate the groups procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container you would also need a control which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in
in this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it the students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good however it does not state what the purpose is here i think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples you would also need to know what samples you could use
after reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the
in order to replicate  the acid rain experiment we must know more than what the group has given us for example in step 2 the students dont tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container they also dont tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of in step 1  6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples they dont say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples another problem is that they dont tell us what the samples are until we see the data table they should say it in the procedure
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used also you would need to know what size and shape the samples are also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesnt state
this procedure is not very specific in its description for one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples it does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample it also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for
after ending this groups procedurei have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each containerthey should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples the size of the samples and the size of the containers we would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers i would also need to know how much of each sample i would need to get before testing lastly i would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results
the group was not very specific in their procedures in step 1 they say determine mass of four different samples samples of what they never say they also say to let it sit for 24 hours where should it sit in the light or dark if i were to follow the procedure the group wrote i would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing
some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis this is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with you would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams
we would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner also what type of container shold be used and if were usin pure vineger or if its a solution lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours
i would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment
some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed the other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over
to replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different also you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours
in order to replicate this experiment there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object the word sample should be more specific so its absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers lastly there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment first i would need to know what type of material is being used another thing i would need to know is where to keep the material in sunlight in darkness outside i would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup
are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again now much vinigar they used and what progress the samples made inbetween
in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup you should also use the same mass as in the original experiment and you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry
after reading the groups procedure the additional information  i would need in order to replicate the experiment isthe amount of times to do the experiment how long to let the sample sit each cycle and i would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container also i need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way you can know what your dealing with
in order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples time and containers so you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects
in the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment these 3 changes to the procedure will make the experiment easy for replicate
since the groups procedure is a little vogue in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know some additional information first youd need to where to let the sample sit and dry because that could make a difference and you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant finally youd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use you know by looking in the data table when they dont list items in the procedure
after reading the groups procedure additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment and most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow
in order to replicate the groups procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed with these pieces of information i could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results
in the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment the students listed  everything  but they didnt give us the time they started so you will know when to start the 24 hours so you can drain them and let them come out
i think that if this group that did the acid rain investigation should of recorded the temp of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount  so they didnt tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry
four different samples p pour vinegar in each p place a sample of one material p after 24 hours allow samples to sit out for 30 min p determine the mass of each sample
you would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours label what liquid you used for this lab
you would need to know what samples you would need to use how much vinegar to put in the container say if there was any repeating the trial
after reading the groops procedure some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is then i would need to know what the three samples are i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use the amounts are not specified finally it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be
in order to replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balancescale should be used to determine the mass
it is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples the constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container
after reading the groups procedure there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement in the procedure the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass also the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers last but not the least the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples
to replicate the experiment you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes place a sample of one material into one container a label repeat with remaing samples placing a single sample into a single container
the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are how much vinegar to pour in to the containers why to rinse the samples out with distilled water what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does and what i will measure the samples in to find their mass
the students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results  also to replicate it i would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified
the information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers the size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment
some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container you need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples
i would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on i would also need to know the problem to this experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment
in my opinion they should add more informations of the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature they should do more than just one try with each sample it should be at least 3 to get a better data they should have measure mass much more often as well
in order to replicate this i would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for so you dont know what to test also around how much of the samples do you need 100g or 50g or 10g also how much vinegar to pour into each container they must should be specific they could have also added what to measure in grams kg lo etc they should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in lightdarkwarmcold
there are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment first we need to know how much vinegar to add in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given what size and configuration should the containers be  it says identical but does not specify anything else thirdly how do we determine the mass of the samples 
atleast three pieces of information i would need to replicate this experiment is 1 what safety equipment should i wear 2 the exact way to extract the samples from their containers 3 what do i need to determine the mass of each sample
first at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there in step 2 you need to be told how much vinegar to pour in step 5 it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry then in step 6 once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples
you would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use the size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment
the additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples
in order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information one piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container you also need  to know what the conditions are made out of the last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container
i dont think i would add any additional information the procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational
to replicate the experiment i would have to know the size of its containers i use also i would need to know how much vinegar they poured in lastly what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment
in order to be able to recreate this experiment i would need to know what is in the cups i am assuming that it was same type of acid because the marble lost 4g the limestone lost 13g and the plastic lost 1g the acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials and different acids have different rates of corrosion so i would need to know what acid acid and its ph in order to recreate this experiment
to replicate the experiment a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample they would also need to know what containers they used a person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment
this experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated it will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment it is also important that the materials are the same shape and size so they have the same surface to volume ratio
without the table a lot wouldnt be known by looking just at the procedure first in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of second you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers lastly in order to replicate the experiment the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials it would also help if it was specified in the procedure with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials balance in what unit grams
the procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data this is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down you cant see the results as wellyou would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample you might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that i would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students
the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be how much vinegar to pour in the containers how big do the samples have to be what should the labels say on them how much water do i use and how long do i rinse for and how do i measure the mass 
in order to replicate the experiment the group of students need a control in warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar in the first step the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on also the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samplesthis additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow
the group of students didnt specify what samples they were referring to secondly they didnt include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers they didnt give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3 or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4 all of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment
1 determine the mass of four different samples p 2 instead of pouring vinegar pour a different kind of liquid p 3 use three different kind of containers to see what happens p 4 after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water p 5 allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min p 6 determine the mass of each sample
to replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container the group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment
if i was to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material i would also need to know how much vinegar you need and i need  to know the size of the cups they are using
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples and what yourdetermining the mass of in their procedure it doesnt say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used it also doesnt provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of
after reading the groups procedure a few things are missing i would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment by having all the masss the same it would be easier to determine the difference i would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get also some information such as how long i should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment
if you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you
how much vinegar to use the temperature the experiment was conducted under how much of such sample should be used
say the amount of vinegar put into each cup how do you determine the mass  and
how much vinegar do you pour in the four containers
in this procedure the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used all this information is needed to replicate the experiment
in order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether its the same amount for each in order for the experiment to be replicated the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabillyyou also need  have a control which would be one of each placed in distilled waterthe mass of each material should relatively close so that there isnt a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material
how much liasis was used in each containerrinse with distilled water for how long how much the container have to be
one piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same one more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers
they need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable they also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid another thing is they dont mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar this is needed for comparison a control one with just pure water is needed to increase validity
additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup you should also know if all the materials are close in size
in these procedure its not explained what this sample is that there putting in so if we knew exactly what is was it would help there should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar the last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use
after reading this procedure the students could add the amount of vinegar in number 2 that you would pour into the different containers another thing the students forgot was the different samples what are they they need to include marble limestone wood and plastic into the first step the last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container i would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and i would also need to know the size of each container
one would need to know maly things in order to replicate the groups procedure we would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves
first the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container also the group should use a control in this experiment to replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in we would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into
we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container it would also be helpful to know the size of the container  size of the sample to use the process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment also it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much mass of each sample i would need i would also need to know what i should use in order to calculate the masses another thing i would need to know is what material i am massing they dont tell you any of that in the procedure i also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment but if the same amount isnt used each time then it wont be a control
in order to replicate the groups experimentsi m going to need to know how much vinegar i need and how large of containers i need
additional information that i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used and i would also need to know what shape the samples are
the students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups how much of the material they will to put into the containers use the same amount of mass for each object
the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material
for this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials also what would those 4 materials be it never states what materials to use how much vinegar should be poured into cup p should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things there also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water
after reading the procedure additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i am putting into the four containers
1 one thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid rather than viniger 2 another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types 2 plastics and 2 woods 3 instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could messure the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger
the additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was startedthe difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more masswhich sample had the least an explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
repeat step 16 p round this data for the 2nd trial p compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples p observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment
additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure write you need to make a data table to record information form a hypothesis and you would need a control
1 what are the four different samples p 2 how much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample p 3 how are you going to measure the mass
to replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers there needs to be a control and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved
they have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment p they have to measure the amount of vinegar p they have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples
in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that wasnt involved that is needed first in the product it just said pour vinegar it didnt say how much which is important another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in in steps it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes to didnnt sayat whattemperature finally when step 4 says mix with distilled water it doesnt say what temperature the distilled water has it just says distilled water i would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be
i would first need to know what material the samples know and i would need to know how much vinegar i would also need to know how big each sample should be also how big the container would be
the information that i would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used the other thing i would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with which is the starting mass last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment
you need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers you also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in also you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min
one piece of information i would want to know is how big each piece of rock plastics wood
in order to replicate the experiment you would need a control such as water to compare the results to you will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup you also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples that is the additional information you need
1 what kind of samples  p 2 how much vinegar  p 3 what kind of container 
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample rather than varying the initial mass too i would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically storing the samples is another vital area in this experiment the temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment
the people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first also they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense also they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure
first you need vinegar you must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water after that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample
in order for me to replicate this experiment i would have to know how i would determine the mass of each samples when do you pour the vinegar in the containers and what does distilled water mean
in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need a mass scale vinegar containers stickers for labelinga watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it i would also need samples of marblelimestoneswood and plastic
the information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like
to replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar different environments could affect the date third you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data
in order to replicate the experiment one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container the students should be more specific in giving the directions well they never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in they should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end
write down the results that you come up with record your data weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is these are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed you would also need the total of all the samples
how much vinegar should they put on each containers
additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using  marble limestone wood plastic also it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup and what kind of cup to use also how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly be more specific on how to dry the samples should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes or just let it sit
the groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on
the additional information needed would be the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup you would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in lastly you may need to know that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic
the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers they had only done the procedure once to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times they have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result in the procedure it says 2 pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers
after reading this experiment there is a lot id need to know how much vinegar are they adding to each container they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results i would also need to know what sample goes in each container
make sure they start with the same mass
after rending the groups procedure there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be what type of samples i use the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure it doesnt tell me why to do these a final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass instead of determine the mass of four different samplesthey can say use a  to measure
if you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers you would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass
some information i would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass also i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and finally where do i pour the samples when filter and after the containers 
in order to replicate the experiment you would need four samples the sample materials should be marble limestone wood and plastic also you would need vinegar to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples additionally distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials four different containers to hold the samples and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples
i think that these braid made to for the
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment then it says you measure the mass of each substances you would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not that could affect the out come if you dont know
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers you would need to know how big the containers were and finally you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers
they could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them
to replicate this experiment i would need to know what four different samples i am getting and how to measure the mass what containers do i put them in how much vinegar do i put into the containers do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours do i cover the containers how do you measure the ending mass of each sample
to replicate the experiment  you would need to know what samples to test how much vinegar to put in the containers and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours
in order to replicate groups expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples we would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container
you would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taabs label them with what they are then wait 4 awers and see the mass change in the objects you put into the vinegar over night
if i would replicate this experiment i would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass i would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses i would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample
you would need to know what kind of material was used marble limestone wood and plastic what would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes if you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples what do you use to measure the samples and when
first you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container also you would need to know what type if container to use next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly in order to replicate it another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another
additional information needed is you would need to know is what the mass from the camse containers when they were full you need to know the four different samples how many containers you need
1 you would need an expiremental control having just vinegar p 2 no more than one trial for each sample to have precision p 3 you would need to label how much vinegar would be put in
first additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3 then after step 6 find the difference in mass of each sample the step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples
i would have to know how much of each sample i would need to put in the cup as well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours also i would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours i would need to know all of this if i wanted to replicate the experiment
additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples i would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups if they do not spesify then the results may come out completly different they should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use
after reading the groups procedure i realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples you need to know the samples are  limestone wood marbles  plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are you also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used
the first most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement you cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use the next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be you should not have to guess what or appropate size should be also the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container the amount of vinegar needed is essential information also the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored for example should they be left covered or not
you need to add to number 4 it should say how much distilled water for number 24 it should say how much vinegar
those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers and to allow the samples be dry you also need to determine the mass of the samples first
in order to replicate the experiment three more pieces of information i would need to figure out are how much water to rinse the samples with where to place the containers during the 24 hours under sunlight in shade and also what size the container is and what shape one more piece of information we would need to know is how many more trials to preform will all that new information i will be able to preform a more valid experiment
in the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where also could add a control for this experiment they also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added
in order to replicate the experiment the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass the students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container they also should add more trials for more accurate results
what would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples vingar cotainers and water
this groups procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples i determine the mass of the different samples i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers
in order to replicate the experiment  a list of materials should be included especially the dependent variables  marble limestonewood plastic it is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table each substance marblelimestone wood and plastic should replace the wordsamples in step 1the procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variablesbecause some sample retain water better than others woodretains water better than plastic there is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples in addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams
to replicate the experiment i need four different example then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes finally determine the mass of each example
you will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if its right
in the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker if we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you dont get skewed results
the first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples they also need to tell you to find  record the starting mass of each sample youd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs finally they need to say at what temperature they should sit room temp
after reading the groups procedure there are some pieces of information that are not given for example the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers they dont state how they find the mass of each sample lastly they dont give the names or amounts of each sample
in order to replicate this experiment i would needed to know the different types of samores they should add that to the procedureanother important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containersalsoi would need to know what the control is they dont have a control to show how the others were affected
the three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent its easily affected the final result
first i would describe the materials i am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didnt say what
what type of marble limestone wood and plastic did they used
to replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing you also need to know how much vinegar you using you may also need to know how much you
needed to replicate this experiment
you would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used you would need to know how long to rinse the samples for as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them
i would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar i put in container
the information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable
three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass how much vinegar do you need in each cup and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers tell what the different samples are in the directions and to be sure about the answers perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again
need to follow the procedure also need to know them too
to replicate the groups procedore i would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would i use another piece of information i would need to know is how much vingar should i poor into the the four identical containers and the last thing i would need to know is what would i use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar
you may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container you never know you can mes up
you would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not as this would affect the amount of mass lost you would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass you would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use
in order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup how much water you need and the amount of vinegar
after reading the procedures the additional things i need to know is what size containers how much vinegar to put in the containers
in order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if its the same or not you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers the given procedure doesnt tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers
three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesnt say how much vinegar is needed second it doesnt state what are the samples like what rocks they are it should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble a third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this a fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with a fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment
additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container
in order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers to pour amount in ml of vinegar in each this extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately
in order to this experiment to be replicated i would need to know how many or what size samples i should be weighing how much vinegar needs to be poured what to label each container and how long i need to rinse each sample only if i know these specific details will i then be able to complete the experiment like the other group
one thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with most likely they should use grams or miligrams also they should have a step for recording their data finally the should say that in step 3 all cups should have the same amount of vinigar they should also add a control
what we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more
in this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers you would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material this would allow one compare each sample effectively in step 4 the procedure says to remove the sample in order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers
in order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know the first thing is you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers the second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment lastly in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks
what you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures
additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample
additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure also what type of containers should you put the samples in how big should they be another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right
if i was going to replicate this expirmenti would need to know what the samples arehow much vinegar i need to pour in the containers and if i should measure it before i start
the information that i would need to order to replicate the experiment would bewhat the purpose of the experiment is they give me what to do but not what im looking for
some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable they would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples how much vinegar was used how much of the samples were used it doesnt say how much was used in step 2 or 3
the three things that i think the procedure could and should have had but didnt was the type of container to put the sample in how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with these things are important because if there are differet types of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container you also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word sample also step 3 should be switched with step 2 in order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment
the procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked first there was no specification regarding the samples the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested let done specify which suitably materials were used marble  limestone wood and plastic they also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at as well as the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data
i would need to know how much vinegar  they used how big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using
step 1 should be to gather each materials p you need to know what materials to use p step 7 should tell you how to do the graph
one piece of additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers this is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass so the amount of mass lost in each sampleif the amount of vinegar is inconsistent then the data wont be valid i would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container
find the difference in mass
after reading the groups procedure the additional information i would need is the amount of vinegar used how to find the mass and the room temperature in order to replicate the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with a table of ingredients and the conclusion
to replicate this experiment i will need to know the size of the containers in which i should pour the vinegar the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials
the starting mass the ending mass the difference in the mass label the samples
the information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what material i am putting in the container i need to kind the control group indipendant variabledependant variable control variable also what temperature they were in and what i am lableing the containers
they should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use
to replicate the experiment i would need to know the substance used as the samplei also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup the starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment i need to know how much vinegar i should put into the four seperate containers i would also need to know what temperature i should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours i would need to know where i should place the containers too for example in light in dark place or have it exposed to sunlight
i would need to know how much vinegar i was pouring into every cup i would need to know what the samples were in the procedure i would also need to know to record the data and take observations
one piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples in order to replicate this i would need to know what samples they placed into the containers
to replicate this experiment i would need to know what type of measurement item i would need to determine the mass of each sample also i need the names of the samples that i need to use such as marble or wood lastly i need from the procedure a control because i need to be told what i am testing for
in order to run this experiment i would need to know what samples are being tested i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution i would also need to know what size the container should be that im pouring the solutions into
what are the four different samples there is no control so how do you know what water is how much vinegar do you need to put into the containers how big does the sample need to be
some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers what are the sample and what are they testing for exactly
there are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
the group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out
i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup i would need to know how much distilled water i would need and how to determine the mass of each sample also how big would the cups have to be
the information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group also what are the four different samples another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion
you would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers let it sit for 24 hours remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water and then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
i would need to know why wood did not changewhy limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
in order to complete this experiment i would need to have
to replicate the experiment you would need to add what samples you are using like marble limestone wood and plastic you would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container and lastly you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass
record mass of all different samples record the starting mass of each sample record the entry mass and the difference in mass
place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samplesmeaning a sample into a sangle container
this group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment one additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials did they use a scale of a halause another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment lastly the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with
you would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample you would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar
in order to replicate this experiment i would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample
the replicability isnt very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable like 100ml per container also the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at so the repelilicn can have the same temperature also there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed
the experiment is and requires everyday materials if i did this experiment i would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container
in order to replicate the experiment  i  would need to know what  the four different samples were the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers and i would need to know  the problem statement i would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them i wouldnt know what i was testing for
additional information i would need to know to know is how much vinegar i would need to put into each up this information would make sure that i get the same results every time instead of putting too much or too little of the substance
some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample also instead of containers use glass bottles
clearly this group procedure is not clear they ask you to determine the mass of four different samples they did not state which samples they also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects without that i cannot be sure if my data will be reliable
you also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container what types of container to use and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment
to replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them
i would need to know the certain type of 4 samples i would need to use to complete the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so i would have unreasonable results i would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment whether it it is big medium or small it would also help to show the problem so i would understand what i am trying to investigate
in order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
in order to replicate the experiment i would need the marble limestone wood and plastic to be the same starting mass that way i could tell which one is mot effective with vinegar easier
some additional information would be1telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials 2 tell what the three samples are and 3 describ how much vinegar goes into each container
in order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information we would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container we also need to know what the samples are for the experiment third we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would have to know more information for example it says to put vinegar but it doesnt say the measurement of how much would be needed it would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in lastly the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar
the additional information i would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd
the additonal information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind you would also need to know how they determined the mass you would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup it would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in
the pieces they forgot to include were how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances
the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1 to gather all the materials 2 tell how much distilled water how big each container was p 3 record data
the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample the amount of sample poured in each containers and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table
to uptake this groups experiment i would need an additional information i would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers also i need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers and lastly i would need to know what to unlike on the containers
the first thing i would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4 also the procedure should saw what the 4 different samples are  marble limestone woodplastic also after placing the samples into containers i believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others
which material you are using for the experiment also record their masses before the vineger and also when its in the vinegar you also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples the starting mass the ending mass and the time also the difference in mass
in order to make the groups experiment more replicate the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable secondly how much vinegar should be added to each sample thirdly in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity a control should be tested in an experiment like this the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled h2o
to replicate this procedure you would need to know many things for instance you would need to know how  big the container migt contained each separate sample were you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers you would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate
after reading the groups procedure to replicate this experiment i would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain i would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion
the changes they could make are p 1have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container p 2they should repete the experiment more then one time p 3and they should make sure they have the same size of each material
you would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass you would also need to record the time that the samples were being listedlast is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in
first you would need to gather all of your materials that is important because you dont want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready second you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different lastly you need to remind to make a control group to compare results
you would need the the for sample rocks vinegar but what we dont know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock then pour vinegar  leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better after 24 hours time to longer  from the container leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put inthen after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps a few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at
change the amount of havre p leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes p pour vinegar in each of for separate but different containers
one thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results the last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results
some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container how big should the sample be in question 3 and how much water do you rinse it with in question4  also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube
the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples the amount of vinegar that each container would need and you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container
the group should include more information about what problem they are investigating there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble limestone wood and plastic the students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used they would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact identical amount
you would need at least  4 containners some vinegar and label stickers also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass
these students should say what the samples were that they used for example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble limestone piece of wood and a piece of plastic i would need the four samples inorder to complete this task secondly i would need vinegar in four separate containers lastly i need distilled water for the samples and i would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples
maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins
in order to duplicate this experiment i would need to determine the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
after reading the students procedure i though that they needed to add some things in their graph what about the 24 hours didnt they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school because if they did then they cant stay in school for 24 hours a day how about the containers lastly negative numbers in mass i never knew that you can have negative grams
well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 98 limestone got 104 and wood 112 plastic 72 for the starting mass 5 project
we would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment we would also need to know what kind of container they used these two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original we would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio lastly we need to know the concentration of the vinegar
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of the sample is put inalso how much vinegar to pour in i would also need to know what  i am measuring the mass ingramsetc if i had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment they also need say where to place the samplesa counterin the sunin the closetthey say nothing also the biggest of all what am i taking this for
the groups procedure is not very well done in order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables it says pour vinegar  there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results the procedure also lacks multiple trials the experiment was only completed once in order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using
i would need to know how much vine
the reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish
after reading the groups procedure you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results
it is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container it is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used the group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in
the procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples pour vinegar in each of four separate but idential containers after of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes
to make the procedure correct the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers without that information i could not replicate this experiment
in order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances also in this experiment you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water also in this experiment it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out
you are going to need marblelimestone woodplastic and vinegar
you will need to do the same steps over but you need to be safe with gougles apnn maybe gougles
you need to know the amount of vinegars you poured the size of the containers you are using and all samples must be put in the same areas because the temperature and sunlights does changes the result
some additional information i would need to repeat this experiment would be the amount of vinegar used in each cup the how much distilled water to rinse with as well as the amount of time spent rinsing
the first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain the second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with d water the third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container also i would need to know what samples i am using i would need to know what size or shape of container to use finally i would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass of the material what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on
after reading the groups procedure the additional information i would need is to determine the mass of each sample at the beginning also to determine the difference in the mass at the end of experiment
i would need to know how to determine the mass specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to  the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight
the additional information i need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables the materials needed to conduct the experiment this experiment also needs trials
one additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using this is key reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure another piece of information i would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup lastly i would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar
you would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water and what kind of samples they are
what was the mass after 30 minutes p what was the mass after 24 hours p what was the influence between each time
to replicate this experiment i would have to know the problem and how much vinigar to pour into each container how much water do you rinse them with and for how long
in order to duplicate this experiment i would need a list of materials what kind of samples and simpler steps
to replicate this experiment you would need to know what samples to use it does not state what samples were used until the data table was shown
the massuse different mass different type of materials and different containers
for the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup for each sample i would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used
ill make sure that when im going to end the massi will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending massso it wont turn out to be a negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass
i want to know if the containers are the same size also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate
the additional information you would need is the procedureyou would need the marble limestone wood and plastic you also need the starting ending and difference in mass
indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of how much vinigar must be poored into each container recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure
first the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step in step 3 the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar also it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy
in this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
i would need p wood massstarting 112 ending112 p marble massstarting 98 ending 94 p plastic massstarting 72 ending 71
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar would be added to each tube the group also need to specify what the samples are also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experimentprocedure was over
in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing 5 lbs 2 oz etc also we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open also what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours  darkness  light  both  this is what we must know to replicate this experiment
to repeat the lab the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece
the three pieces of information needed is which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured which container lost less mass which container lost more mass you could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers
after reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added one by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control the group did not mention a control if there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials
to recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers you would need to know what the samples are how much of each are you would need p  aka amount of vinegar p            what kind of material the samples are made of p            how much of each sample youll add
additional information that you would need to repeat this experiment would be one how much vinegar is added to each separate container two how much of each sample is added to each cup three what you are measuring the weight in four what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours
the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is why would you need identical containers material and vinegar
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to
to replicate the experiment you need to determine how much vinegar was used in each cup for this experiment you also need to determine the tempature the did the experiment take place and how much of the material was used
in the procedure more specific information is needed such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with with more specific information this would be a well written procedure
the students should include which is most resistant least resistant and how many drops of acid rain vinegar they put in
i would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample id need to know what to lable the containers id need to know how to preform the steps not just what the steps are of the experiment
in this experiment many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it first was that the names of the sample were not given so we dont know what to take the mass of second was that it didnt tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure lastly we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24hour time period other than this the experiment was written decently
before the students put the objects in the solution they should have weighed each sample the students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct to make their experiment better they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches
the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is poured in to the containers how much of the sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the single container specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use
the 3 key materials that i need to replicate this experiment is vinegar a few plastic containers and a triple beam balance
if you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass ending mass and a difference in mass you will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock you will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar
the additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big i refer the containers what temperature was the room at to make it dry how many items of material were put into each container
in order to replicate the experiment i need to know what the samples are such as  wood or marble i need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and i need to know how big the samples should be
some additional information that would be needed to replicate the acid rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment lastly in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should i dry it
i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container i would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours i would also need to know how i would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample and i also need to know how many times i would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar
they would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours are they all in the same spot as in dark or light thease are some key things that need to be included
they should label the materials makes sure the scale is calibrated make sure you have a few days to do this lab
to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant the containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same the materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know which types of samples to begin with marblelimestonewoodplastic you would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2 and lastly what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in
some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2 what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in
what temp is everything they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar also repeat twice
you need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with you also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container you need to know how bigof a container
additional information would include what were the four different substances how much vinegar was put into every cup also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference
we would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point
the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample
to replicate this experiment i would need same additional information i would need the viner what type of container to use how long i should since we sample with distilled water for and water to determine the mass of the samples were and samples the experiment finished
the most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 15g of mass the other dont have much difference the stranger samples in the acid rain is wood because didnt lost a gram
in order to replicate the experiment i would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment because i am ensure of what i am testing for also the problem to know what i am trying to prove and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment without these pieces of information included it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report
one piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in another would be how much of the samples that is not specified the last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for
to replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps first of all they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples also they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded also they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass
you would need to pour vinegar in each of 4 seperate size identical containers place a sample of 1 material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples
to order to reapit this experiment i need the number of mass limestonewoodplastic how much zone i have to doesnt tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right
in order to replicate this experiment you would need corr
additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers and if it should be the same amount in all more information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water lastly information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours it doesnt say if the samples were put in different locations
measure the amount after the 24 hours place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry
when they are going through the procedure they did not include the names of the tested items they also didnt say what they were testing it for
after reading the procedure there were 3 things missing the three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object
the mass of four different samples p the time for them to sit p the purpose of the experiment and wich sample p distilled water better
in order to replicate this experiment we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6 or what instrument to use we would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2 finally in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry
you would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses you need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample and also you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids
after i read the groups procedure i determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2 another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need the last piece of information you need is what size container should you use
additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material also good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials
1 in the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation p 2 how much vinegar should be in each cup p 3 include with what we should determine the mass of the samples
how long the samples how much the vinegar at how big should containers be
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know were the samples were some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler this may have been effected the experiment
the group stated to determine the mass of four different samples samples of what they should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on they stated four vinegar in each they did not tell us how much vinegar to use also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group
what was their prediction before they start after check if their prediction was right or not
to reeplicate the procudurethe additional information i would need includewhich samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers
i would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak make sure they are dry before making on dont let any types get mixed up
the group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used because that would impact the results they should also include the size of the seperate identical containers which could also impact result the group could have also included information about the vinegars temp which is an important constant
we need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples it would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use then the lab would  be performed correctly
you would need to know what materials to use the amount of vinegar to use and
in order to replicat the expirement the procedure must tell us what materials they use for samples they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water
well im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer but i think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck upmore because wood suck any liquid up so it would have a different answer
additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups what the samples youre using or and what your control group is going to be there are important parts of the procedure that are missing
i would have 4 container caled the 4s marble limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee let it sit  dry out for 24 hours  deterime the mass i got at the end culd compared it to the mass i got in the begeing vig
to replicate the experiment one would need to know how much  vinegar was usedit would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used to replicate the experiment one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in
i would need to know how to measure i samples i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade
hypothesis to take a guess  wether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right p independent  dependent variables in the students experiment p results  the would didnt have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 112
in order to replicate this experiment we should be told the amount of vinegar in mls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator
to replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples you would also need to know how long to rinse the samples you would also  want to know how they dried the material if you want to get the same data
in order in replicate the experimentyou would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examinedwhere type of scale and should the sample the measurewhat substance are now indicatedall of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to
what the samples are what type of containers
additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers
another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary
i would need the size of the containers how or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at
in order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done one would be to say how large each sample should be it should also include what type of sample is being tested  another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use another good thing would be to have multiple trials
you would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample to make an effective experiment you would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data also you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers all this information would help produce a successful experiment
in order to replicate the experiment you would first need to know how much vinegar to use also the amount of time its supposed to sit for most importantly you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one
you should obtain 4 seperate containers and then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples this will give you just the mass of the samples not the samples and container combined the amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly
the group in this experiment can do
you would need vinegar a sample material to put into a measurement and label them also you would need four identical containers this is to replicate the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass that is what you would need to replicate this experiment
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers you would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top
after reading the groups procedure and making of the students data recorded i would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment one such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples also what they used to determine the mass of the samples lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information
i would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups
starting mass ending mass change in mass
the additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion
additional information i would need to repeat this experiment includes which four samples we are testing how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers how much of the a sample to put into the vinegar what i would put the samples in after i remove them and how i would determine the mass of each sample these things are needed to replicate the experiment exactly or else i would not be able to know the directions and do the experiment the same
well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container an how much of each  sample  an what type of vinegar i would be more specific
additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples i would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment also i would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare should it be submerged or not also i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor what is the temperature lastly i would want to know the acidity of the acidakavinegar
you need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers you need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples
make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass also record the ending mass and the difference in mass also record the lowest and highest mass
in order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedureone must know what the four samples are the amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well alsothe person performing the procedure should know how much of each sample to take and what type of measurement to use when determining the mass grarns
with step number two how much vinegar should you pour p with step number three what sample  goes with what container
the additional information that we would need is how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers also it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label lastly it says to place a sample of one material but it doesnt say what kind of material and in the beginning it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we dont know what kind samples  so they should say the names of it there is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure
where do we keep the containers how much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use
the additional information that the group did not add in  was how much viniger was poured in each container if each container had different mass of viniger then it will affect the out come of the samples you must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible
one thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long they rinsed each sample with distilled water
you would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment also if the mass of each sample is different for example marble being 98 grams plastic being 72 grams and wood being 112 grams how is the mass of each determined
in order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information you would need to know materialsthe 4 different samples arehow much vinegar was usedwether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar without this information our data could be different
some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else next make sure you get all the data and make a chart
to replicate this experiment project you would need to know what type of containers were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers also you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar how much distilled water you need to rinse it with and how well
you would need to know what material the samples were made of you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container you would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container
to replicate the experiment id need to know how much vineger to pour into each sample id also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup
i would need to know how big the containers were how much vinegar to use and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment
to repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
after reading the groups procedure several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated first the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified
in order to replicate the experiment you need the starting mass the ending mass and the difference in mass for example the marble starting mass is 98 the ending mass is 94 and the difference in mass is 04 now for the limestone the data the group of students got was 104 for starting mass91 ending mass 13 difference mass now for the wood students got 112 starting mass 112 ending mass and 00 for difference mass
how much vinegar to pour in how much big are the containers and which type of scale would i use
in order to replicate this experiment it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with each starting mass the group used were different having a significant effect on this results you would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container also it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results
for step two how much vinegar do you pour in p for step four how do you remove the samples from the containers p for step three what do you label the container
some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container tell how much material they used in each container and stated if there hypothesis was true
1how much vinegar should go into each container  p 2why doesnt it matter which sample  p 3does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results 
to replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures the materials and the time to do this project
in order to replicate this experiment a few pieces of additional information are needed you wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers you would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample it is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical
the additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers tell the size of each material such as the marble limestone wood acid wester  the should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment
three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen secondly you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data
in order for someone to replicate the experiment this group should have immediately include the names of the four samples substances also they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples this group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment when replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup you would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed such as a hot environment or a cool one
you will need to pour vinegar in four new separate but idantical containers then you will need to get four new samples and determine the mass for four different samples
for this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four sampleswhat were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light dark rooms and temperatureshould you do the experiment twice one in light roomone dark different temphow should the containers be placed
to replicate this experiment i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2  3 for each diffrent motivel used
some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples im useing which unit im measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isnt to evident  in the procedure
you need some pictures and a statement
1 let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time p 2 try different containers not identical  different sizeshapes p 3 try more than  one type of acid besides vinegar p 4 let samples sit larger than 24 hours
in order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample also you need to know what kind of container plastic metalpaper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such
to replicate the groups experiment i would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers
in order to replicate the experiment the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate containers in step 2 another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure a third piece of information would be how much water you should rinse each sample with after the 24 hours
well you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment so it could be the same
you would  have to see what is the amount of rain also  need all the measurements  of the vinegar
to replicate this groups exiperiment i would need to know how much vinegar i should use what samples to use incase the graph wasnt shown then i wouldnt know and lastly i would need to know how to determine the mass since i am unaware of how to determine the mass in the procedure it should say determine the mass by
some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem results conclusion etc you will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion
initially in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use the students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced the students  should have included the type and size of the container the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples the third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined
after reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable central and costenithypothesis and problem statement
the group is missing a whole in 1 of important details i would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
you would need to tell us how long it stayed out there
how do you find the mass whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar
i would need to determine the mass of four different samples then i would sample the marble of the starting mass then i would make sure that i have labeled of all the samples of starting mass ending mass and difference on mass after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry
other information
you would to add the labels again then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work
additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment what also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples instead of having each one vary from 72  112 for example maybe have each one way 98 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid
the groups procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in
first you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup secondly the amount of each substance should be the same next what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide
additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers i would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period finally i would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it
aluminum foil  black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet the alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out
you would need to know what materials to get you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup they should have told us what to measure the cup with they should have also told us what type of container to use
you would need to know how much vinegar to pour list of materials to use and how much of each material
in order to duplicate the experiment i would also need to know what were the samples being used what king of containers i need size i would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample
after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need how much vinegar to use and you need a control to compare the results a control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass the procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass
the procedure is missing some critical info first of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab i would not know what i needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers finally the group did not say the size of the container
one piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used you would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup you might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same on other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of ho applied
you would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process
there are several things this group should have included in their procedure they did not specify what type of container or how large they did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container they did not say what to do with the container when you finish they did not specify how  they determined the mass
the additional information i would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to use  why this experiment is being done what is the purpose of this experiment if so i would need to know the types of materials to use
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into into each container what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample and what materials should be measured ie marble limestone
in order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are the procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use these three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the sample of the materials is you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers
this procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment the necessary samples marble limestonewood and plastic are not listed in the procedure the amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated these are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample marble limestone wood and plastic
some additional information you would  need  a control you would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure
additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it what kinds of mass should be added in so that can cause confusion the way i know  what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded the procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass
additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup you would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion
in order to replicate this experiment thoroughly one would need to know the approximate size of each sample as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently also are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours
well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it but dont have to find the mass between each object
you will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it
i want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain because there is no introduction to describe the purpose p how much vinegar would i pour into the beakers p what materials do i need to conduct the experiment
i would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like the information given is good but doesnt really explain why they were doing this experiment for but the table was good and understandable
how much vinegar are whe poring how long are we rinsing them
the information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample in order to get accurate results you would
after reading the groups procedure one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what theyre testing for example they could have said determine the mass of marble limestone wood and plastic another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results finally another thing this group could have said in their procedure making it easy to replicate is by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers
what i would add in the procedure is that  i what are the materials you need 2 record your data 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with
the additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container an additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight
you would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container how much each sample should be included in each container where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out
after reading the procedure i would like to know the time given for each material also if their were any color changed and what was added to the material
they should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well p they also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample p they should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample
after reading the groups procedure additional information i would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples i would use what to label the samples and what should i measure in
in order to replicate this groups experiments you would need some additional information you would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours
you would need more vinegar and marble limestone wood and plastic to replicate the experiment
the second step should state how much vinegar is usedin step four how much vinegar is used in step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated
one additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass
i would need to know what were the four different samples how much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains also what to label the containers and should i leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours
to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container it would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be lastly they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking if they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else
the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in the size of the containers and the thickness of the insulating material
additional information you would need would be to put more time a sample to write down the starting time  ending time  try other samples next time
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know p 1 how they got the mass of the four different samples p 2 a list of constants p 3 you would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if its the same for all four materials
the additional information i would need is to know what size the containers should be i would need to know what to label the containers also how much vinegar i have to put in to each container
for this experiment i would want to know how much vinegar i should pour into the cup pouring different amonts could change the mass the other information i would need is if i needed to rinse the material in a timely manner 10 sec 20 sec etc this could also effect the mass of the material i would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size that also could effect the difference of the masss
wood starting mass g 112
if someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are usedif being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materialsalso the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in therethey should also specify that types of containers are usedmaybe restain types affect the experiment and some dont and they should then made note of that
in order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample
the group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container the group also forgot to mention what samples they are using without these 3 main information points nobody could replicate this lab
to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were inhow much of each sample and what type of containers are being used
samples of what and what is the purpose of the experiment why should we do it what do we have to do with the data
additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for finally the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry you need to know whether it should be in a cold wet environment or maybe warm  dry
in order to replicate the experiment procedure should include the names of the four different samples the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup and the size of the four identical containers
in their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass they would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass in order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers we would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls
after reading the groups procedure some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample and the mass of the samples to container
first in order to repeat the experiment i would have to know whats there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container
some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts
dont know
after reading the procedure some things are still unclear they should say what 4 samples are being tested not just mass 4 samples also how much vinegar should we pour and in what sort of container what should we lable the 4 containers as  how should the samples be removed from the container  and as always what are the materials we need and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety
some additional information that i would need would be how much vinegar do i pour into the containers in what measurement do i measure the four samples
one thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these
the three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble limestone wood and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar at the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone marble wood and plastic at the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone marble wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each
to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container i would also need to know firstand what my samples are i dont want to look for them in the results
they would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples they also need to include how much of each sample there should be and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure
to be able to replicate this experiment the group would need to add what each sample is they should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table so that all the information is clear
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that i should pour into the four cups i would also need to know where to store the cups it would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment
in able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added p 1 what are the samples p 2 how much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers p 3 what unit of measurement is used to measure it mass p 4 what kind of containers were used
you need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy then we get plastic of starting mass
the additional information that i would need to know is how would i find the mass of any of the materials how much vinegar do i pour in each of the containers what do i do to the materials or containers before i let them sit for 24 hours
one way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know a few things suppos the ph of acidity of the vinegar the surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area
a tell how much vinegar you used p b
i would need to know how much of vinegar do i put in the containers how long do i rins the sample for
what are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples how much vinegar did you put in each sample
to replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information an conclusion and a graph
additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include p  what kind of four samples are being used p  how much vinegar to pour into the containers p  what kind of containers are being used p  how to to remove the samples and place them into containers p  what to label each of the separate containers
first of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use
to replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing how much vinegar they used how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used if they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment
in order to replicate this experiment it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic therefore it would be below it we would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in the type of plastic is also important to know
more information that i need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us and they didnt what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers also they didnt lable each measurement on the chart
in order to be able to redo this experiment you need to have all of the information we need to know more about how they did this experiment more details is better
the additional information that is needed is how  they recorded the experiment they need to separate that experiment more when mac always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment tell what happen how in the first experiment
to replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information the group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers when you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment
to replicated the experiment i would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use you would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with to replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in the type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results
after adding i determined that
the group was missing how much vinegar they used more trials for each material would improve this lab
how much vinegar do you put in the cups 
they should describe what the samples are how much vinegar do you put in each container
three additional pieces of information i would need would be the size of the samples how much vinegar poured in each container and i would need a tripple beam before to measure
the additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples they should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample without these you cannot replicate the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers i would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours things such as temperature are necessary i would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours
first their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested also they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2 the experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to without a control we dont know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason
the additional information i would need to complete this experiment is this first i would need to know which one to put in first second how long should i wase wish water then finally where should i let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out so that is the additional information i would need to complete this experiment
additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do i need
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples i also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample
tell us to do it again
one thing i would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container also i would also need to know how long i would rinse the material off far finally i would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table
in order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to one last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar if when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree
say what kinds of materials there using why there doing are experiment
to do this experiment you need to know what the samples are how much vinegar to use what do you label the containes and how do you determin the mass
in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things first the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified second one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples if any third the procedure doesnt tell you to find the difference in mass which you should
the students should have included information about what the samples were what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use
the group will need to put to the following information what are the four different samples what type of containers will be needed also what size they will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar the temperature should be consistant
i would need the types of sample materials that are being used it does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so i would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in finally i would also need to know what type of equipment i would use to measure the mass
to replicate this experiment  you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container also for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used last you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples
to replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that youre using you would also have to know where youre leaving these  containers and lastly to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container youre putting these in that and  or the size of the original sample
to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with you might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in as temp affects the results of them rens
to repeat this lab i would need to know what kind of vinegar they used how much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not
after reading this procedure other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers they should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control this is the same information i would need to replicate the experiment
so far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup let silt for 24 hours take samples sit and dry them you would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference
to replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure the procedure does not state what the samples are the last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins it does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass
one thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need in step 2 they do not say the size of the container they just said you need them also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers
to replicate the acid baim experiment the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear there should be a set and constant amount of vinegar and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included it should also say how to find the mass whether to use water and a graduated cylinder or a triple beam balance
in order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with
the group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using they also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container the experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening
you would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original thirdly how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab
although they got some information i think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things the first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours if they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that i have listed than it would be successful
the group didnt say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure they also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container they should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container
they need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container you need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate you get the mass before you do anything to it
the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is the materials all the steps that they did
to replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant you will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each
the students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not
after reading the groups procedure to replicate this experiment i would need a scale four identical containers vinegar  a sample of marblea sample of limestonea sample of wood a sample of plastic  a stop watch water and labels
in order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things what type of woods plastic limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use how much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not also what siz container another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some dont absorb more or less water and finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed
i think the project needs to change
first the stat mass should of been the same its know a product that they did nothing to they did change anything you can change the time
it didnt give enough information
in order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure for instance in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with and specifically which samples also you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers in step 4 the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure can be the result of less accurate results
1 gather materials p 2 pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers p 3 place a samora of the material into the container and label reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container p 4 after 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water p 5 allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins p 6 determines the mass of each p 7 clean up where you worked
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers and id also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical containers were i would also need to know how much water distilled was used to rinse off the samples and for how long did the students rinse the samples i may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment
the additonal information youwould need to know is you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken if shaken you would need to know how hard to shake it different prosseces are created
after reading this groups experiment i have found that to do this experiment over again i would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do i put the materials inwhat size container was used to put the materials in  what surface or what do i are the materials with and how much vinegar  would i put in the if separate containers i would  need all this information to perform of this experiment
in order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin in order to have a valid trial of data i would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples
after reading the groups procedure i noticed they didnt measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample another is where should the samples sit in sun or indoors this may have an affect
the group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass
you need the type of materials needed the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it
the additional information i would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment i would need these 3 pieces of information so i can repeat this experiment
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment you would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples
a control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so the procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome it would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you wont forget it later on in the experiment
in the procedure it does not tell you what the samples are if you need to use
there is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1 the four samples should be specified as marble limestone etc as they were in the data table in step 2 how much vinegar ie in ml should be desorined as  well as the type of container a jarplasticbeaker etc also in steps vi determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams lastly there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table
in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept i would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount lastly i feel that i would need to know what to measure the mass with by knowing this information i would be able to replicate the experiment
the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample also i would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container
this experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing the group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials they need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up
what the samples are how much vinegar should be added to each container where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period
want wise the shops if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing if it was dry how much rinser did put in it
the information that you will need is the measurement hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things these are the main things you need to replicate the experiment
you would need the names of the samples you were using
to repeat the experiment i would have to know much vinegar i am pouring into containers i need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet
the students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution a quantity of vinegar needs to be specified as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution finally the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold a constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid
the procedure given doesnt have enough information so that someone could replicate it what else is needed is to state the different samples needed it also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples lastly we need to know what kind of containers how big each of them are
you would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it you would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated
some additional infomation i would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar i would need to put into each cup exactly what materials i am to add in each of the four cups and also how to remove the samples from the containers
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment
the students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water they have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass
additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data also name the four different samples you will be working with also make sure you work with one sample at a time
i would include what the samples are wood marble etc and would label the containers that way i would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used i would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at
after reading the groups procedure the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment would be a control they dont have anything to compare their data to they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments also they didnt show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data the group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of one material in each cup i have an idea how much one material is
to replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem what is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables
first you would need to know what materials to use as samples second you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container lastly you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at
know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water
the amount of vinegar stated in procedure  z p the type of container for each substance p how much distilled water you would need to rinse
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for
two samples of each material must be collected make two charts one for your first trial and one for the second calculate the averages from your two trials
after reading the groups procedure the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment the type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed alsothey do not mention how much the samples are record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results
some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container if not specified someone may put too little  or too much and the results can come out very differently you would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry
if i wanted to replicate the experiment i would need to know what kind of containers to use i would need to know if i should cover the samples in the containers i would also need to know what the samples are how am i suppose to know what i am tasting if i dont know what the samples are
additional information that would be needed we need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample what temperature to keep sample at and how long to rinse the samples for
i would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic some other information i would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red one last thing would be does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
you need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps
to properly replicate the acid rain experiment you would need more information than is given in the current procedure you would need to know what materials the  four different samples are in step one how much vinegar to put in the  separate identical containers in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container rather than only plase in in single sample in a single container
in order for me to replicate this groups procedure i would need to have the problem their hypothesis also the independent and dependent variables
i think what i will do is to change the procedures instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours ill let them sit for 48 hours ill let them dry for 60minsand
you would need an experiment contron a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
to replicate the acid rain experiment the group would have to include how much vinegar to pour into the containers what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with
1 gather materials p 2 put on apron  goggles p 3 set up materials p 4 por vinegar into a identical containers p 5 put marble limestone wood plastic into their separate containers p 6 put name on container wait 24 hours p 7 rinse the samples with distilled water p 8 put samples out to dry p 9 determine the mass  other differences p 10 clean up materials
additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakersi would also need to know what is the ml size of the identical beaker of size altered or not the
first off we need to know how we should be measuring the mass like with what kind of scale they should also specify what units we are using such as grams they also dont tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what samples they used another piece of information i would need is how much vinegar do i use for each sample lastly i would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer
in the procedure they never said how to the difference in massg and what it means also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container also they never said what of the samples were
one piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure another would be how much at the sample to put in the containeralso the procedure doesnt state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are
this group left out some important details when writing their procedure in order to replicate this experiment i would also need to show what i would measure the mass with  how the amount of vinegar i should put into each container  what the other materials would be these 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better
the group neglected to include what the four different samples are they should have said use a scale to determine the individual mass g of four different samples of material marble limestone wood and plastic they also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers they should have included how much ml vinegar should be poured into each container what containers are made of they also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to they also never listed the materials that needed to be used
the way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what i would measure to measure the mass with a sale second i would need to know to measure the mass in grams third i would need to know if i should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram
in this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container it may be the same but we need to know a measurement also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample  for instance we dont know if a certain substance goes in a certain container lastly they dont explain how they determined the mass  in order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis draw a conclusion say what you are experimenting
after reading the procedure some additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are i will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container i will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers
to replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp
one thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment you would also need to have the samples all the same size thirdly you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same you would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample  after the 24 hours rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass
to repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers you would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses you waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs also what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers where would they sit
i will need to collect all of my materials i will need four containers and my four samples i will have to place the four samples in the containers then put
if you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike marble limestone wood and plastic also fresh cups of viniger
additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample how did the students figure out the ending mass and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours
in order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container they could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container they could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use they could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment
to replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to useyou would also need to know what the four different samples were lastly you would need to know how long to note samples for
after reading this groups procedure there are four different pieces of information i would need to replicate this exact experiment one the group must include what the 4 samples are anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing two you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container thirdly they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours lastly i would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers
in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information first of all it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers also from the students written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are that would also be helpful lastly it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass
in order to replicate this procedure it would have to tell what the samples are there is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used which could happen without proper explanation
they didnt come up with the independent   dependent variable p  make up a question p  create a hypothesis
in order to figure out how to replicate this i would need to know the containers size also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in i would need to know how long to wash with water for
some additional information that would be needed are specific things first the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers the experiment can also describe the materials since the word materials can mean almost anything the experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containersyou would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers
after reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was also you would need to know what kind of vinegar theyre  using as well as how much to pour into the container you  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water
first piece of information i would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container
additional information i would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar  to compare the masses of before vinegar after
to replicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container they also need to get rid of the determine the mass of four different samples and instead say mesure the starting weight of the samples
you would also need to include a list of supplies a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed
this group needs a control they need something that wont change they also need them to have all the p samples with the same starting mass lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container p that is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in
the temperature they were left at know what substance the samples were what temp the distilled water should be
the groups prosedure could  use they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end also list the type of meteral they roused and they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused
1you will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at p 2the surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar p 3how much vinegar to put the samples in
in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to come up with an hypothesis the reason why i am doing this experiment and a conclusion
while doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment for  what is the problem another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation
you would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment you would also need to know who the groups hypothesis was by knowing the hypothesis youll something to compete with your findings and last the group should have said their control p this will give you data to base your exams findings onto
the additional information that i would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers what are the four samples to put something over the containers and what are steps of the samples
i think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is we want to add it up to see what mass is better we need to see what sample looks good because you dont want to have a bad one
in order to replicate this expirement they would have to
specify what the samples are in step 1 specify how much vinegar in step 2 specify the size of the container in step 2 in step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first naming the four different samples given to you secondly you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers thirdly you would need to know how you would determine the mass example with an electric balance the students need to be more specific on their materials
additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples a control group and a dependent variable
when the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat it does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back you dont have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container
in order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use for example list the marble limestone wood and plastic also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water and what will you use to determine the mass of the samples
additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this one important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers without putting the same amount it can change the mass of the samples another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated how are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is
why they are doing this exparament  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed what is the controll  for the experament 
what i would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes p also multiply the last row for starting mass ending mass difference in mass be they repeat it
additional information would consist of its shape resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment
one piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup and the last could be if there was a control to the experiment
the additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed
first things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar lastly i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them
one thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything also i would need to know what the containers looked like so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment last the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change
in this procedure i would of also mentioned weighing the rocks i would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and i would of listed how to find the mass
some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples
the following additionnl information i would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what kind of samples was i supposed to got and how much i need to use for this investigation so i can replicate the experiment
the procedure left out some information that is needed for step three it doesnt specify what material or what size container to put the material in it should also tell you to do repeated trials
fix this experiment the procedure needs additional information for example the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers then it needs to state how much of each sample this procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers
maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out the name react ways
in order to replicate the experiment  id need to know what 4 different samples i needed id also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container id need to know what id use in order to determine the mass
after i had finish reading the informationi think i would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then i would need to determine the mass of each sample
there are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants
the additional information i would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples i will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor
this group needs to include quantitative information such as how much vinegar this group should try to eliminate the use of the word sample it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about i also think it would be better if possible to use the same mass for all samples this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material
the additional information that you would need is the statement why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong such as this the type of result you were looking for
you would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers you would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area p lastly you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside or on a table etc
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what type of samples i should use in the experiment just saying samples is not specific enough i should have the exact type of material i also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment should i use a lot of vinegar or a little 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment i also need to know how to find the difference in mass in procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment
1how much vinegar  how big a container were the samples completely covered p 2what temperature did the samples sit at p 3rinse samples how long or until what desired effect 
some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used you would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass
i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup i would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items how long do i rinse the sample in distilled water for
the first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers they never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples
to replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get i could get any thing i saw and it would fit the description in the procedure you also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them you should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system
the students would also need to keep recording every thing they see
1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen
the procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing they have to be clear and actually name them also we do not know how much of each sample to place in the container it should have a constant mass for each of the samples the procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in h2o it is very important to know the amount that they put in
you also would need to know how much vinegar to use what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples
after reading the groups procedure there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment first off you would need to know what the samples are and what size of samples you will testing another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that youd pour in the containers step two from steps one and six you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in ie grams poundsouples
the things that they couldve included would be that they need a constant they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do
to replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples in other words samples of what one would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container one would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours
to replicate the groups experiment 5 other things i would need to know are p 1 what samples p 2 how much vinegar i need to pour p 3 how much of the samples i need to pour into each container
if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of each sample was used i would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container also the size of the container would be helpful i might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material
additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container i would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
additional information i would need to know would include several things i would need to know what the four samples of material are i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container i would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be
first you would need to know what samples are going in the cup also we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup
some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before during and after the chemical reactions also we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly you need to recheck your calculations
in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what different samples to use they show  4 samples in the data table but in the procedure it only says four different samples which can be misleading and confusing we would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each lastly in order to replicate the groups procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to
the groups procedure is missing a couple of elements for one they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly they need to record the size of each sample they need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples
in order to replicate the procedure you need to know when other materials you will need what samples you need
you will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples how to determine the mass of the samples what materials to use for the sample these were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment
first you would name the four distrant substances say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
i would need to know what step are testing what the independant variable is what size be samples they are talking about i would also need to know what other variables are controlled
to replicate the experiment the first thing that a group would need is a control variable second we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers in able to complete this experiment lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in in able to have the experiment preesse
in order to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers we also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment what the hypothesis is
the additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment
in their procedure the studants werent very clear on what the samples were if they didnt have that table i wouldnt have known what their samples were they also didnt list all the materials they used for this experiment so if i tried to repeat it i could only guess the materials they used these students also werent very descriplive in the procedure the way they worded some of the steps was very confusing they needed to make it clearer
the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble limestone wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified
in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble limestone wood and plastic specifically their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples a second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials thirdly one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesisconclusion
the experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic the experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment it is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing how to calculate mass know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment
after reading the group procedure i would add what the four different samples were for step 3 i would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps i took after step ca i would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are 1 how to determine the mass and 2how much vinegar to pour
i would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers with what am i going to measure the mass of each sample i think that i would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved specifically what am i trying to find out
in this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning but it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass
if you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure you would also need to know some additional information you would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted the procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment it is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples says to use the same scale for all the masses
to repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container you would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature light exposure and other factors
determine the mass of four different samples
i would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers i would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp also what should i remove the samples with tongs
to replicate this procedure ill need to know the size of the containers ill need to know the samples and ill also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container the amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample
the additional information i need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar i pour in each of the containers how big or small the containers have to be and whether or not i should close the containers
you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container the type of container what they mean by a four different samples if not given data table as well as the form of the rock liquids crushed whole etc
three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is first how much vinegar do you place in each container what are the samples you should use and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment
i think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe they could of extended the time so instead of being for 24 hours it can be 48 hours for best results i would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate
in order to replicate the acid rain experiment it is essential to know what the samples arein the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples what are the samples also how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample in step 2 it says pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers what is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used also in the 4th step it says to rinse each sample with distilled water for long should the sample be rinsed
in order to replicate this experiment more information is needed it would be important to know how much vinegar into each container it would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be finally to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used as different woods have different properties
you would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add how much sample to add into each solution in order to replicate this experiment
one piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar how much should you have in each container another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example 1in2in marble square
the additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar
number 2 pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers this can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass
to determine the mass of four different samples to pour vinegar in four seperate container place a sample of one material into one container and label after 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample
we would need to replicate steps 16 for samples p marbles limestone wood plastic p what kind of containers p if the containers are dry it can change the difference in the mass
in order to replicate this experiment we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment
the procedures i think they should have included inorder for me to replicate the experiment would be how different samples did they used for each what tool did they use to determine the mass
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many ml of vinegar they used how much distilled water to rinse the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each sample
in order to replicate their experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into each of the containers as well as what kind of samples we are going to measure it should state specifically marble limestone wood and plastic it should also tell us on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results the last thing that would be needed to replicate this experiment is to tell us what kind of containers the samples should be put in such as wooden boxesglass test tubesziploc bags etc
pleace a simple of one material into one container and label it repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container
determin the mass of four different samples marble limestone wood plastic they all have starting mass and end mass and the diffrence the wood has the most mass but marble has the most diffrence in mass
in order to repeat the experiment you would need to know what you are testing for they never say the reason for the experiment you need to know how much vinegar they used because that should be the same for each container also in their procedure they dont tell what the samples arent if you only had the procedure and not the graph you wouldnt be able to replicate is because you dont know what they were testing in the vinegar
to replicate this experiment you would need four new samples you would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment in
after reading the procedure there is a lot more information that they need in order to replicate this experiment they should say how much vinegar to put into the container and which container to put it in they should be more specific when stating how things should be measured by saying measure mass on a tripplebeam balance etc
after reading the groups procedures i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container this important because  it could affect  how much of the sample is dissolved i would also need to know were to store the containers in a cold or hot room with light or dark also i would need to know the formula for finding the difference incase i didnt know it is a common error to subtract the wrong masses finally i would need to know how long to rinse each sample and whether to dry the samples under light or notthis would affect its weight
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know the names of the three samples being tested in the experiment the amount of the sample being poured into the containers would also be necessary as well as the amount of distilled water being used to rinse each sample another important factor would be to know the location of samples were placed in to sit and dry for 30 minutes how the students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate the experiment
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to determine the mass and then label each of the four containers i would also need to put the same amount of vinegar in each container the last additional changes i would do is to clean up gather my materials first and then determine which material is right for solving my problem
what the hypothesis iswhat they are trying to prove how much vinegar is needed and added to each sample what can be used as a constant
after reading the groups procedure the additional information i conclude that they need for me to replicate the experiment is where do you put the samples when you replace them from the containers and how to determine the mass
to replicate the groups experiment the procedure would have to state how much vinegar was poured into the containers also they should specify what kinds of containers they were using as this could affect the results in the procedure they also failed to tell what 4 samples were used in the experiment a key variable to its success
some information that i would need to replicate the experiment are a list of the materials id need to know how to determine the mass because those things are not stated in the procedure
to replicate this experiment the person would need to state how much vinegar to use how they re going to determine the mass of the end and how long to rinse of the samples with water
information that would be required to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container the size or amount of each sample of material and where to store the sample when they are drying from the vinegar
the student should have stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not also they should have added what couldve went wrong in the experiment and what should they have worked on to make better
in the procedure there is not enough information for someone to replicate this experiment the procedure should include namingine four samples that need to be determined and how much vinegar needs to be poured in the containers the students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass these three things could improve the procedure of the experiment
one piece of information that i would add is how much vinigar to use in each container the 2nd piece i would add is how big the container should be a third piece of information that i would add to this experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table
for me to be able to replicate this experiment i would just have to follow the procedure over againfor example i would have to determine the mass of all four samples next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separate containers and act
additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is you would need to know the data collected from before another thing you would need is to know the collected information on last and final thing you would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for 30 mins what was in the when you pilled it out
in this experiment i would also include how it looked after 24 hours why the mass went down and why you would put the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
you would need a list of things to get supplies those would include such things as a scale cups the samples vinegar and distilled water another thing needed was the names of the samples themselves in the question and there is no reason or problem stated
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples youre using are in step 1 it says to determine the mass of  four different samples also in step 3 it tells you to place each sample in a different container howeveryou are never told what the samples are that you are using
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers i would need to know this because if i just poured vinegar into four cups the amounts would be different and it could change the results of my expierement
any additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to use so there are same amount in each container how much water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass also students may need to know what unit to measure the materials in so they can get almost exactly what the other group got
to replicate this experiment i would need to find out what kind of containers i need i would also need to know what to put the samples on to sit and dry finally i would need to find out what the students used to obtain the mass of the samples
the procedure is very unclear in order to replicate this experiment the procedure must be more specific for example instructions must be made about how much vinegar must you pour into the containers what kind of containers should be used specify what the four samples are in the procedure
in order to replicate the experiment you need to add to the procedure first youd need to know what four samples to use how much of the sample to use how much vinegar to add to the sample decide what container to put the sample in and how much distilled water is used to rinse the sample
to be able to separate this experiment their needs to be  more information in the procedure the students should be specified for amount of vinegar added to the samples the students shouldve added that the experiment should be repeated to be sure the results were correct the last thing that was  missing from  the procedure is a list of the four samples being used
in order to replicate this experiment they must supply more specific information for examplethey should list the four different sample names second they should give the size of the container last they must specify how much vinegar and the possible strength of that vinegar
after reading the groups procedure information that needs to be included is tell what they are taking samples of another thing they should include to how much vinegar they are mixing with each sample the final thing they should include is about how much of each sample to use those would be needed to replicate the experiment
well the procedure does not state what the four samples are and you need to know that in order to do anything you also need to know how much vinegar should be used and you would need to know whether the samples are placed into the same containers as the ones with vinegar
you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put into each container you need to have a control sample after washing the sample do you put it back into the container
give the amount of each sample needed for the experiment have the amount of vinegar needed to the experiment give the amount of freely to rinse and how long do  varies  and should the all same time and what temperature was the water
to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the control was if there even was one to begin with the measurements for the vinegar and amount of each material placed in the vinegar are also left out the names of the materials should also be mentioned in the procedure
after reading the groups procedure the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be the different samples used how much vinegar is going to be poured into each of the containers and what should the containers be labled
in order for me to replicate the experiment i would need o know how much vinegar to pour in each cup and how much f one substance without doing that it can effect each substance differently
the procedureshould explain what the samples are the procedure should say to calculate the difference in mass of each substance the procedure should explain how much vinegar to use
some additional informatio would of bee what four examples should we whaz or what adding vinegar to the samples as getting to do
in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know what materials the samples are made of step number three would need to be revised to say that each sample has its own cup of vinegar also an amount of vinegar was not determined a constant starting mass should have been used between the four materials because the vinegar may have ecoded more of one material due to a larger amount of surface area
some additional information that you would need to replicate this experiment would be things like the mass of each of the samples before they were put in the vinegar the temperature of the vinegar when it was put in the cup with the samples the size of the containers that the sample and solution were in and the amount of vinegar that they put in the cups and also weather they did multiple trails or not
you would need the nishpoping  and you would need to know were they got the number from
how much vinegar do you put into the containers take out materials determine the mass with a triple beam balance
to replicate this experiment i need to know the materials and how to find the mass because one cannot assume that another person knows what they are doing
at least include three piece of information in order to replicate the experiment the procedure are determine the mass of four defferent samples pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container after 24 hours remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water determine the mass of each sample
in the procedure it should state how to determine the mass of each material also it should state the amount of vinegar poured into the container
three pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment are 1 amount of vinegar poured into the containers 2 size of samples marble limestone wood plastic and 3 how much distilled water is used to rinse the samples
to replicate this experiment it would be important to know how much vinegar should be poured into the four containers in step 2 this is unclear therefore the amount of vinegar should be specified next the group should specify how much a single sample is the samples should be constant therefore results are comparable the group should decide on a certain mass sample to use for the four materials lastly to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with right now this information is vague
in order to replicate this experiment i believe that the group needs to include more information on the sample they need to say where the samples are being stored during the 24 hours and at what temperature based on this given information the could be located outdoors or indoors where the temp would effect the rock sample also they must include the amount of vinegar used in the container they simply tell us to pour vinegar but never include an amount
to determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etcwhen  pouring the vinegar put what youll be measuring witer ml liters etc be none describtive  when labeling samples
you would need to know how much vinigar to put in you would need to know what the group is testing you would also need to know what the group is testing for what is their statement 
some additional information that i would need is i was to replicate this experiment is what samples to get they would need to say we got all four samples then heated them another piece of information that i may need is to find out the difference in mass from befor and after the experiment and last is to have a step that says to release the scale so that the mass can be removed
in order to replicate this experiment the procedure would need to include the amount of vinegar used in each cup we would also need to know what the samples are while the data table identifies them it is not clear from the procedure what  we are testing also we would need to know exactly what it is were testing the procedure should include something about recording the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass
in order to replicate the expiment you must have to mention the four types of samples list the mass and after you have you see the difference in mass and double with the information of the results of the mass
the additional information i would need in other to replicate the experiment is to named the sample that i would have used in the expeement
i would add how much vinegar is being added to the four containers i would also add more samples to the lab and i would repeat the lab again to see if i get the same answers
the first thing i would have to know is what are my samples going to be of i would also want to know how much vinegar im suppose to pour in each container i also would need to know what type of container im to store the samples in
1 determine the mass of four different samples marble limestone wood and plastic p 2 pour 20ml of vinegar in each of four seperate but identical beakers p 3 place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container place all of containers in the same place
you would also need beakers and test tube and a timer
you would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container also how big the containers are that you need to put the materials in to ensure that they fit the placement of the containers is important because if they are left in the sun when they shouldnt be it could change the results how much distilled water one needs to put into each container is important to know too
besides knowing the procedure in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know what the problem is that we are trying to solve that way i could make sure i am coming up with the right information to answer the problem another piece of information i would have to know is if there is a control group this is because if there was one i could compare my data from the different samples to the control group also i would have to know what the control variables are because if all of the variables that need to be controlled are not that my information would not be as valid as it could be
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add in each container and how big each containers it also doesnt let you know how big each sample should be or what type of material plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area
the additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar that was pored into each container the temperature of vineger how long and visarable the samples should be rinsed number of trials type of container the sample should be placed in and what types of equipment should be used to determine the mass
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in the four containers
you wouldnt need any additional information that prscjar was correct and could be duplicated the way it is presented in the procedure
what kind of vinegarhow much vinegarwhat kind of surrounding do you dry the samples
after reading this group procedure i would need to know how many units of vinegar should be added to each cup which samples to test not what the starting mass for each sample should be these three factors were left out and these factors are vital to the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment the students should add more procedures they would double the hours to see what would happen repeat the experiment and not rinse the samples with distilled water and dont dry the samples
to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar was used for the samples to sit in we would also need to know what the samples were that we were testing in order for the experiment to work and we would also need to know that we should be recording all of the data that we were collecting we would also need to know that we should subtract the differences in masses to be able to compare the results
the additional information you will need is at the end say to record what you have found out also i would say has with distilled water to use to use plans ruin anything
1 the amount of metrials that you needp 2how much vinegar do you pour
the additional information needed would be if there was a constant variable if there was a certain temperature that the samples sat in and how they got the difference in mass
i think that i would need the timing because i guess they have to take the time and i also think that i need the measure of the four mass samples and how big were the materials
i would need to know what four different samples to use what kind of containers to put them in and i would also need to know how to find the mass of each of the samples after they dried without this information i could not replicate this lab
the procedure needs to state what samples to use instead of asking the reader refer to the data for exact data the procedure must also state how much vinegar to use also step three doesnt state whether or not to put the samples in the water but separate containers as the vinegar
need to know how much weight of the sample to start with how much acid rain should be put in the test tubes
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container this would allow the experiment to work adiguity if one container had more vinagar than the other then the experiment would fail
when the procedure says pour vinegar in each container you dont know how much vinegar to put inalso when it says place a sample of one material i dont know how much that is to put in the container it also doesnt say how big the container has to be
the ivdvcontrol variables and constant variables must be included in the procedure
in order to make this experiment replicable you would need to be more specific for step number three it should clarify which sample and how much of it to place in the container they should add a step between three and four saying where to place he samples for 24 hours for the last step they should explain how to determine the mass by using a triple beam balance
one thing that would be helpful to be able to replicate this experiment would be to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers are they should have also told us what the materials were that they were using and how much of it to use another thing that should have been included was how they are going to determine the mass of everything
1you would need to know the four types of samples in this experiment p 2you need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four containers p 3you need to know what temperatures to have the samples in room warm cold
to replicate the experimenty you would need to know the amount of vinegar placed in each container you would also need to know the temperature at which the containers were stored in addition you would need to know what materials the samples were
in order to replicate the experiment the additional information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers i would need to know how long i should rinse the samples with distilled water i would also need to know how this group determined the mass of each sampe in order to replicate the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to knowhow much vinegar was used to see if that played a major factor on the difference in mass also you need to know how much distilled water is used to rinse off each sample because the water may wear away the sample even more lastly youoneed to know what youre measuring the mass with
in order to replicate the experiment the additional information you would need is what the samples were how much vinegar was put into the containers and also the temperature of what they are going to put the containers because whether vinegar may us more acidic
after reading this procedure i have figured out that you would need to know  the type of the containers used weather or not they wer test tubes beakers etc also you would need to know how much of each sample you would need in oz kg g etc finally you would need to know how much vinegar to use in l ml etc
additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the data table that was recorded starting the into on each sample information such as the samples starting to ending mass and difference is very important to understand because it is needed to understand the results of the experiment
first i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers second i would need to know what the size of each sample needs to be then i have to know how much acidity is in the water
you would not need any other information to replicate the experiment they tell you how long to put the samples in the vinegar how to rinse them how big to let them sit but one thing is how much vinegar did they use in each container
the additional information that i would add is how much vinegar in each container i would also add a purpose of the experiment after massing the samples on step 6 determine the sample difference in before and after weight
after reading the groups procedure some information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to measure out how much liquid vinegar they used for each sample and then measure it again after they take the centiment are to measure it
well after reading the groups procedure i relized that the additional information they need to give you is how much vinegar to pour into the four separate but identical containers the group does not show that the samples sat for 24 hours then they removed the samples and rinsed each sample with distilled wateralso how do i know like where i am supposed to dry them in a windowsill in the cup in a microwave or just to let it sit there till it drys
the three most important pieces of info that would need to replicate this experiment is to determine the mass of the diifferent samples pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers and after 24 hours resume the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was used what sae was the container that held the vinegar and what temperature the containers where kept at durring the 24hrs
additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are what are the 4 different samples that i would be testing what size container would i need and how much vinegar do i use
in step one the procedure needs to explain what four materials are being tested it is not specific enough by just saying four different sample in step 2 the procedure should state how much vinegar needs to be added to each container the reader has no way of knowing this information p the procedure says that the containers should each be labeled but it does not explain how they should be labeled or what they should say in order to be able to replicate this experiment that must be clarified
some of the things that you would need inables to repeat this experiment is tell you what samples they are using all they say is get the mass of four different samples dont state what they are also how much vinegar is being added to the containers they did not say what amount of vinegar they put in the last thing is that
to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples mentioned in step 1 are this way there would be no confusion as to what materials you are working with also you would need to know what kind of containers the samples are kept in lastly in order to properly replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
i would need to know how the samples look in the procedure i feel like this because i already knoxw starting ending and difference in all mass to do the difference i would have to kneew how it was doing threw the procedures
after reading this groups procedure i decided that it would need more information in order for me to accurately replicate in one thing i thought it would need be a given amount of vinegar to be put in each cue like 63 ml for example i also thought that the names of the samples marble limestone wood and plastic  should be given for without them i would not know i was testing lastly i would include a final step thus told the sender to determine the difference between the starting and inding mass so that the reader knows where to go next
one would need to know how much vinegar went into each container one would also need to know how the samples were and their masses
first the group should tell how much of the vinegar to use also they should say how much vinegars the experiment needs to be done finally they should tell you what in the materials being weighted on
there are three pieces of information you might need to replicate this experiment the first is how much vinegar to use in each container a second would be the type of conditions the container was placed in over night because things like light might cause a faster or more effective reaction on the samples third you would need to know in what form the samples are the marble or limestone could be in small rock form as oppose to all solid blocks which may cause the reaction to have a different outcome
this group should for scientific verification repeat i the experiment at least twice they should also specify the amount of vinegar in each container the group should have had a control to contrast their findings
you would need to know how much vinegar you would put in each container and also youd have to make sure that you put equal amounts into each container or else you would find an number of errors in the experiment
i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers also i would need to know how much distilled water i would need to rinse each sample and for how long
determine the mass of four different samples place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container determine the mass of each sample allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
in order to repeat this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each of the four samples this would be essential for us to repeat the experiment step by step it would also be helpful to determine how much of each sample to put in each container and finally in order to repeat this experiment we would also have to do another trial and probably include a control variable to repeat this experiment exactly like the group of students
to replicate the experiment by just reading the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was poured onto the samples and affects the mass also what type  size the container was because that would affect the concentration of the vinegar and also what material the sample were at the type of environment temperature brightness they were left in for the 24 hour period because that would also affect the end result
in order to replicate this experiment additional information should be added for example the procedure should explain what type of samples to use include the number of tools that are needed and how much of an object or sample you need after adding these procedures a person would be able to repeat this experiment
some information needed to replicate this procedure would be the temperature that this experiment another piece of information would be a graph and lastly would be a better explanation
you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each of four separate containers did you remove the samples from the containers and rinse the samples with distilled water also how long did you let the samples sit and dry
in order to replicate the experiment what will be needed is the depended independent and the control which are vinegar the container and the timing to each sample
to replicate this procedure information such as how much vinegar to pour into the containers as instructed in step 2  what materials were used in step 3 or how much of the material was used also in 3 would be crucial
what temperature environment should the containers be placed it cold hot room temp p after 24 hours do you need gloves and or goggles to work with this samples  p where could 2 find marbles and limestone
in order to replicate this experiment i need to know specifically what samples they are talking about what type of control to use in this  experiment and how much vinegar to pour in each container i would also be useful to know if when storing the sample for 24 hours if they should be in a certain temperature room temphigh temp or low temp etc
the students should have included how they determined the mass of the four samples in steps 1 or 6they also needed to include how much vinegar they poured in the containers as well as how much water they used to rinse the samples or how long they rinsed them
a group os student idid a science project called acid pain had to determine four different samples the put the four different samples which is marble limestone wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and see what is the mass afther every sample loss mass expect for wood i had the same mass afther it was measured
i think the group should mention how much vinegar they are using for measurements and they should include to record data procedure should be writen more clearly it would be hard to do this lab looking at this procedure they gave us
in order to replicate this experiment one would need much more information firstly step 2 says to pour vinegar into four containers in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each i would also need to know how much of the four different samples marble limestone wood and plastic to use also in step 5 it says to let the samples sit and dry for 30 mins i would need to know if i should let them dry at room temp in a cold location in a sunny spot etc
after reading the groups procedure some peices of information you would need to replicate the expieriment is the samples like marble limestone and wood
i think you will need a bottle of vinegara container cabels temer paper a manole a cemenstone wood and a plastic you will  need
in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinger to pour into the samples you  will also need to know  what are the four samples you will also need to know constents  controls the procedure needs to be made clear
you would need to know the containers size and what you measure the samples with
step onepour a vinegar in four identical containers p step twoplace a meterial in each container and label it p step threeafter 24 hours remove the material and rinse it out with water p step fourallow the samples to dry for 30 minutes and determine the mass
in the procedure they did not tell the samples that they was doing to be testing also didnt tell us what mass was when they started and when they was finish what was the mass last they didnt tell us that they need to find the difference in mass
in order to correct the errors in this experiment some few things need to be changed firstly the procedure never mentions recording your data this needs to be part of the procedure secondly the procedure states determine the mass it is not explained how to do so and what to use thirdly the procedure never tells what samples are or what to label them as in the experiment this is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what they are working with
their are three things that i would need to know to repeat the procedure the first thing is in their procedure they do not mention the four samples another thing is the procedure does not state the ph of the vinegar also they do not repeat the process for greater validity another thing is it serves ways to setup the content in the procedure
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know first what were the samples when they just said sample if i dont know thetype of thesample then how was i supposed to test for  anything i also would need to know what type of containers they were talleg about wer they using for small graduated cylinder or were or were they using a 50 gallon unit finally i would need to know they amounts i  need the amounts of the samples the vinegar and the distilled water
additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is what materials i would need for this experiment the amount im support to pour in the containers and what are the samples
how much vinegar they are pouring in to each sample
in order to replicate this experiment i would need the following information first i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container second i would need to find out the exact size of of four identical containers finally i would need to know the temperature at which the four materials sat for 24 hours because the temperatures of the solutionroom could affect the results
i would need toknow how much vinegar to put in each container how to weigh the mass of the doyeds how big of the object do i need
in order to replicate this experiment ill need more information if i wanted to find the change in mass of the four samples i wouldve had each sample weigh the same at the begining of the experiment also to make this lab more correct all of the samples should have the same amount of vinegar in them lastly in order to make the lab more correct i would put the exact steps in the procedure instead of saying repeat itd be better and easier if it said exactly what to do
in order to repeat his groups procedure you must have the same amour of mass of each cup place the same material into the same one it had the mass amount then procead with the same thing that you did with the last one sit for 24 hours then rince with distiled water
to replicate the expeirment you would need to know the purpose knowing the purpose of the expeirment allows the person to know what to look for or to expect you would also need to know what type of containers to do the expeirment in so the experiment doesnt go wrong you would need to know where to remove the samples into after taken out of their containers you would also need to know what to do with the containers afterwards
in order to replicate this experiment you need to explain why the samples loss mass what cause it to loss its host or why did it stay the same yo also need to tell us what you sawshow us what happened when the samples were lossing its mass maybe you need to try chemicals on the samples beside vinegar
the group would need to state how much vinegar was in each container they would need to state how long to rinse each container with distilled water they would need to identify what the four samples are in the procedure and to say to record the data
you would need to know how much venegar to put in aso the strength of vinegar if  there is a difference where should the container so far the of have ie in a every regardless room temperature
you would need p 1conclusion about how you did everything p 2results of how everything came out as you wanted p 3information about the procedures
i think that you should start each sample with the same amount of mass so that your result will be more accurate also instead of writing the differences they should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass just stating determine the mass does not tell me how to i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the containers to make the data accurate and constant i would need to know where to dry the samples would they need to be in the sun shade etc
in order to replicate the expirement we would need amount of vinegar used size of container used and how much distilled water was used for rinsing
additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be a more specific description of mass and how much mass you are using what kind of containers need to be used and what size
they should have done more tests they also should have wrote what the experament was about
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into each container you would also need  to know the amount of distilled water the container are to be rinsed with and what qualities  a sample to be the most efficient
i would need to know what sample was put in each container also how much vinegar was poured into each container
you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container as well as the size and shape of each container you would also want to know the type of vinegar used all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity
to be able to replicate this problem you would have to know how much vinegar is going into each container also why they are performing the experiment what the problem is what are the different samples
there are several pieces of information missing from this procedure  first it is important to know in the procedure that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic this information is not given until the data table also the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be poured into the containers finnally it is necessary to know how much of each sample material should be added to the containers with vinegar with this information replicating the experiment would be much easier
the additional information is how are we suppose  to measure the mass of the object they need a indenpent varible and i  need to then the control
the additional information needed is p name the specific samples used in the procedure p say how much vinegar one needs to pour into containers p should the samples sit in light dark areas or covered 
some information that  you would  need is the amount of vinegar you should pour into theseperate containers second of all we should also know how long we rinse the samples for finally we need the previous results to compare data
additional information needs to be added to this procedure they need to put gather materials for step one they need to tell exactly what samples rocks they need to add the amount of vinigar they are going to pour in they need to make the last sentence in step three a separate step this procedure was not carefully organized
what the group forgot to do was tell the amount of vinegar to pour in each container the group also forgot to include whether or not if they need to cover each container they forgot to tell what metric unit to measure the materials with which was grams
in order to replicate this acid rain experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use since it should remain a constant also how big each sample is results will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size also all samples should be kept at the same temperature in the same area so they are not affected differently
the group could have told how much vinegar the acual size of the container they used and the size if all the samples for example how lange  was the piece of wood would size make a difference in the ending mass and the calculation of the difference in mass
in this table its says that first when starting mass that time marble was 98 then its decrease it would 94 so its decrease 04 in limestone the mass is decreas too first starting mass is 104 and then ending mass is 91 its difference beetween 13 in wood no change in starting mass it was 112 and ending mass it would 112 too so its in no change in plastic starting mass is 72 and ending mass is 71 it is decreases its in difference beetween 01 i think wood is not heavy then other thats why its in no change then limestone its in big change to other because its heavy them other
in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know what was in each of the four samples also one must know how much vinegar to pour into each sample you would also have to know which sample of material was placed in which container
you would need to include what the samples are of you would need to include where to record data finally you would also need to know if the mass of each sample should be the same without those bits of information it would be difficult to replicate the experiment
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need to see a few more pieces of information in their procedure firstly i would need to know what types of samples to use i can see what samples the group used by looking at their data table but i would want to know if i had to use the same ones also i would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because my results could change if i use a different amount of vinegar than the group did depending on the amount of vinegar i use the third thing i would need to know is how big the samples should be if it is important for the vinegar to cover the sample the procedure should tell me that so i dont make the sample too big
to replicate the experiment additional information would include new loco 10 wait before trying the experiment againit should are state how much of the samples are bein put into the container and how long the samples should be rinsed for
additional information that would need are to list what are the different samples being used
in order to replicate this procedure i would need to know what the materials werethe size of the material and how much vinegar was in each container
this isnt a clear statement use to this expirement the problem would explain why the students were conducting this expirement in the first place
the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be knowing what the solutions are such as marble limestone wood and plastic you need to be more specific so the reader can completely do the experiment by themselves without asking questions
to replicate the experiment i would need to know what safety precautions i should be taking the exart amount of vinegar to pour into each container and where the samples should be kept during the 24 hours they are in the container
the person conducting the experiment would have to know what the samples were the procedure didnt include that knowledge another piece of information that would be needed to repeat the experiment would be how much vinegar is used for each sample and is the amount kept constant the last piece of information that is needed is what safety equipment should be used safety procedures are often included in the experiments procedure
there is some additional information needed to replicate the this experiment for example the procedure does not say how much vinegar to use it also just says samples and doesnt specify what the samples are of the procedure also does not tell us what type of containers to use or say to record your data
if i were to rewrite the procedure i would incude what the samples were also i would include how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers
in order to replicate the groups experiment one must know the amount of vinegar used on each of the samples also what type and the amount of sample is needed in addition knowing the purpose of the lab would be highly benefitial so that one knows what to test for its imperitive to add the amount of samples and the amount of vinegar inorder to perform the experiment in all exactness otherwise one might receive not only different but in accurate data
the students need to be more specific they need to state how much vinegar to pour into each of the 4 cups second they never said what unit or never said when to record the data lastly they needed to state how much distilled water
you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups you would also need to know how long to rise the sample with distilled water
additional information that would be needed is the initial amount of vinegar then the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours and then the difference in the volume if i had those three pieces of info i would be able to replicate the experiment and possibly compare answers
additional information needed to replicate
to follow this groups procedure i would have to be more detailed like instead of saying samples all the way through the procedure it would have been better if they  the four things that they were testing in it would be less confusion in step two it would have  been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble limestone wood and plants samples into their own seperate identical containers and label them it would have been good to explain why they were told to find the mass of their samples
the information you would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the four different samples the starting  ending and difference in mass you would need the four samples  marble limestone wood plastic  because thats what the experiment is on you would need the starting  mass ending mass and the difference in mass because thats how your doing the experiment
in order to replicate this experiment you would also want to test all these four samples in water as a control in the same exact procedure furthermore it is also important to retest this experiment under a constant like room temperature to make sure it is not a variable in the results lastly to replicate this experiment you would need to know the chemicals in acid rain and chemical composition of vinegar to see if they corrolate and that this experiment is a good representation of what happens wi acid rain
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what samples were used if i did not use the same samples my experiment could come out differently i would also need to know what unit to weigh the mass in if i weighed it differently we could get different results i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container that could affect the outcome of my experiment
to replicate the experiment one would need to know what the samples were without this information it would be impossible to do the experiment one would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each container this could effect the outcome of the experiment in addition one would need to know the temperature of the vinegar which could also effect the outcome of the experiment
additional information that you might need in order to replicate the experiment is to conduct a hypothesis you will need to get organized and gather all information to be able to perform a conclusion in the end with the information
1 i would need to know which type of materials to use for the samples p 2 i would need to know how much vineagar to put in each containar p 3 i would need to know the approximate size of the samples
one additional information needed would be how to determine the mass of each sample how much vinegar would be put in to each of the containers how big would the containers need to be
you would need to say what different sample you had in the experiment where would you put them over night how big would the containers be for the samples
additional data that i would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that was added into the container because if one sample measured more  or less than another the data may also bear alteredi would also need to know the size or the container used and what type of units they were measured with lastly to be able to replicate this experiment one would also need to know the temperature for every its materials such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry on a substance
there is not enough information to be able to replicate the experiment firstly they should state the samples you need to use in step one there should also be a control for you to compare it to the final error is that step 4 is too vague it says to remove the samples but not how to for example with tongs or wearing plastic gloves
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the size of each of the samples also i would need to know the amount of vinegar being used last i would need to know the size of the containers being used and how long to rinse the samples of rock for
do the experiment again but with a different solution p let the samples sit for 48 hours p instead of sit and dry dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth
the group did not include the temperature that they left the remaining samples they also did not include the amount of vinegar that we should pour in the four separate containers also they should of do the experiment more than once to make sure the answers they come out with were alright
the groups procedure needs to be more specific they need amounts in the procedure they do not tell you how much vinegar is to be poured also what is needed to determine the mass of the samples also the samples how much of the sample we need
to replicate this experiment i would need to know the control of the experiment what amount of vinegar is poured on samplewhat is being tested including independent and dependent variade
in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i need to pour into each container if i would need to stable the mass of the samples with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why  am even performing this experiment
the lab needs to include what samples are being added to the vinegar next time the lab should say that you should place a sample of marblelimestone wood and plastic to each vinegar sample
to repeat this experiment they would need a balence to measure the mass of each building material you would also need a graduated cylinder to measure out the vinger out in the experiment it does say the amount of vinger used
additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment woold be what types of containers what type of materials and lastly how much vinegar should be poured in to each container  because it doesnt state these items in their proceduer
you would also need to
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they put in the containers you would also have to know how to dry the samples then you would have to know how to dry the samples
in order to replicate the experiment  in the procedure it should say to write down or mark a chart saying the starting mass and ending mass and start the experiment you need to write down this information because it helps to find out the mass of the different samples
in order to replicate the procedure i would need to know what volume of vinegar to use i would also need to know what sized containers or beaker to use the procedure should also explain what equipment to use when removing the samples from the container such as tongs lastly within the procedure it should state what samples will be used
the procedure should look like this1 determine the mass of 4 different samples marble limestone water and plastic 2 pour 10ml how much of vinegar in each 4 separate but identical containers 3 place a sample of one material into one container  label repeat wremaining samples placing a single sample into a single contem after 24 hours remov the samples from the containers  rinse with distilled water for 3 minutes 5 allow the samples to sit  dry for 30 minutes at room temperature 6 determine the mass of each sample by subtracting the start mass in grams from ending mass in grams 
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup so each sample would be sitting in the same amount of vinegar i would need to know how long to rinse the sample for so they are rinsed an equal amount of time also i need to know if each sample is supposed to way the same or be the same size
in the procedure it didnt  tell what the samples were step 2 said to pour vinegar in four indentical containers but it didnt tell how much to pour 1 we dont measure them we are going to do the experiment wrong step 1 could of said record the starting mass of each of the four samples marble limestone wood and plastic
after reading the groups procedure i believe that i would need the following information in order to replicate the experiment i would need the different types of materials listed in the procedure
to do the experiment you would have to know the starting masses how much vinegar must be added to each container and what the sample materials are
in order to replicate the groups procedure you would need to know p how much vinegar should be pour each cup p what type of container should be used p if the container should be left in the light or dark overnight or it avoid be covered
the pour into the take the vinegar in each containers p who is the problem  hypothesis p how you can do this experiment p a table who explain the experiment p use more types of masses like glass paper etc
one other thing you would need to know is the amount of vinegar placed in each container so all samples have the same amount another thing needed to be known is where are the containers should be placed for 24 hours because the amount of sunlight might effect the experiment other than than this experiment is replicable
additional information is to include the sample names to label them how much vinegar to use in the containers so the outcome is fair for all samples and also point out which is the independent variable and when is the dependent variable and which is the dependent variable to understand the lab better
you would need to tell how much vinegar was add to each sample atthe start
the procedure needs a control for each sample material this would be done by placing each sample into 4 more containers with no vinegar to use the procedure needs to say the amount of vinegar to put into each container the procedure should also say specifically what four samples to use
the group should have provided a control so that i could compare my results in it they also should have been more clear about exactly how much  vinegar i should put into each container each container should have the same amount  but they didnt state what that was the group should have also been more specific about the size of the samples being experimented on im not sure if they all are the same or different
it would be best of they specify what they are sampling in 1 in the procedure it should say determine the mass of four different samples of material in step number 2 it says pour in vinegar but not how much they should lied is at something like 150 ml for the graph it would be better if there was a column where it listed the percentages post so that the reader can understand which material was effected the mass
after reading the groups procedure one would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container
 amount of vinegar would be needed p  purpose of the experiment would be needed p  hypothesis would be needed
in order to replicate the experiment we need to know how much of the vinegar to poor in each container we would also need to know units of measurement we are  using to determine the mass and what the samples are
you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container you would need to get an average for the results lastly you would need to have samples with the same mass at the start
some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment are the names of the different types of material so i knew i am testing the amount of vinegar poured into each container needed to be stated on the results will come out accurate another part of information  that should have been included was a control of just water for each sample so there is something to compare the other results to
we would need to have a contini also an independent variable and a dependent variable
in order for me to repeat the expiriment i would need to know a little bit more information such as how much of each substance to use how much vinegar to use and what the temperature should be when letting the samples out in containers this person has to be a lot more specific in his procedure very hard to follow
they would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup what sample material would be determine the temp that the samples should dry at
the additional information you would and to replicate this experiment is you would need a lot of materialsyou would need to see the student observations and you would need to see the conclusion bassicaly a written lab report would be the best tool in recreating this experiments
in order for me to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar do i need to pour in the containers i need to know what the sample of the minerals are and i also need to know how im going to measure the mass
in order to replicate the experiment  you will need to record the mass 8 of different samples you also need to pour the vinegar into the separate containers you use hea to wait 24 hours are you have to let the sample dry for a while  then you determine the mass
some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would alst be to have the same amount of vinegar in each of the sample cups to have an equal effect 2nd would be to have the same amount of the sample get the same starting mass for all 4 so in the end you can use which sample was effected the most finally you should subtract the starting mass from the end mass to get the difference to see which was affected most by the substance
in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers you would also need to know what temperature the room they are left in  should be overnight and how much distilled water to use when rinsing the samples
how much vinigar is in each container what type of wood what is the control
additional information needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers another piece of information that is missing is how much is a sample of each material finally you would repeat the experiment a couple of times to see if your results change
i wan need to know what samples to use co i need a graph of some sat to record the starting and ending mass what unit of mass do the samples need to be weighed in
to do replication of the experiment you would need measure how much vinegar are droppingthe other stones have already been used and cannot be used again you also need to have a triple beam balance to be able to see how much each stone eventually weighedfinally you would need to test them what they need to each sample for a separate 30 minutes unless they all get different in at the same time
in order to replicate the experiment i need wood plastic limestone marble and vinegar also i would need water to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hour soak
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to what the sample are that are using i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four samples i would also need to know what i must use to take out the sample would i use my hands or tongs
if i were to replicate this i would need to know how much vinegar they put in each cup do you put different amount in different cups also where should i put the cups to rest inside outside would that have differen out comes
this procedure lacks important details and is not in order step one is too similar to step 6 need to specify what kind of different samples and how to determine the beginning mass step two needs to include the specific amount of vinegar for each container the procedure should include the size needed for the samples to get accurate results step 3 should state what to label the containers with which information in step 6 they should include how to calculate the mass for example subtract beginning mass from end mass add record data results
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was put into the container and what type of coma were used to hold the samples i would also need to know what the purpose of this experiment is in other words what is the group of studen is trying to prove
1 how much vinegar do you put into the different containers 2 how large is the sample being used p 3the dependent or the dependant
one piece of information that should be included is the amount of vinegar necessary in each cup also how the materials mass is determined should be included lastly how big the material is should be stated
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need the temperature of the vinegar the amount of vinegar poured into each container and the amount of samples needed how much needed
some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is steps 16 because there importan to make the table acecit you woud also need to make other table to show you resits and other infomation
the group needs to provide how much vinegar is being poured into the containersthe amount of vinegar can change the exeperiment
how much vinegar how big should the containers be and how big should the samples be are all additional information you would need to recreate this experiment
in order to replicate the experiment the person may need a diagram of the experiment the person needs the promble or statement to determine what they maybe testing for also they need the list of materials they have to use in order to do the experiment
you will need to explain what is happening with the vinegar what happen to the sample after it drys  and what the experiment looks like
they need to say how much vinegar to put in each container the also need to say where to put the label on the material itself on the cup or on the table in front of the cup laslty they need to say how to remove the materials from the containers do they use their fingers or tongs
to replicate the experiment the group would need to better state the problem give an amount of vinegar to put in the containers and lastly use more then one trial
information that would be needed in the procedure would be the name of the sample material also youll need when and how to measure the mass of materials this information is needed to replicate the experiment
how much vinegar what kind of scale
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on the rocks the purpose of this experiment and a control variable
three pieces of information i would need to replicate the experiment are vinegar to pour into the containers a scale to weight the mass and find thedifference  at the end of the experiment and distilled water to rinse each sample with
in this procedure they leave out some thing that makes it im possible to recreate quantitys it says nothing about how much vinegar or rock sam plquantity also using cleaner numbers would make iteasyer to recreate and read
in order to replicate the experiment you need to have information some example of things you would need to no is how much vinegar is being poured in each of the seperate containers another thing that you would need to no is the volume of each substance because the surface area will effect how much is eroded off another thing where you let the samples sit for 30 minutes because there might be difference in temperature effecting how much it drys
the additional information that needed to be included are what the samples are the amount of vinegar poured into the containers in step 2 also need to be known another part that needs more information is how much of each sample needs to be placed in the container in step 3 another part of this experiment that needs more information is step 2 what type of container should the samples be placed into
one piece of information i would need is what are the four different samples another piece of information is how much vinegar i need to pour into each container the third piece of information i would need is how much and how long should i rinse each sample with distilled water another piece of information you could use is at what temperature conditions are the samples left to sit and dry in
in order to replicate this groups experiment you will need top know how much vinegar is being used how long you rinse each sample and conditions the samples are drying in
you would need to know what to take samples of the procedure isnt specific in what materials are being weighed you would also need to know any safety procedures to be taken while conducting this experiment also the procedure does not give a specific place to leave the containers additionally the procedure should tell the dimentions of the samples so that their volumes are all the same
the additional information you would need to know is the shape size and liquid
to secrefullu replicate the procedure i or anybody else would need the following information first a statement that will tell me what i am doing the lala for amaterials list will also be needed last i would need a better procedure that is
in order to better replicate this expiriment the students must also tell us the amount ofvinegar poured into each cup ms the amount of water used to rinse the materials in ms and the time given to rinsing how long may each container rinsed in water
in the procedure number i doesnt explain what four different samples to use another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to use after reading this procedure i would be able to replicate this experiment not knowing how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment
some additional information thut hey coold put in the data is how much vinegar they pot in the container and another thing that they could say is about the temperature of the room or the vinegar
the three additional information that can be added is the control of the experimentthe students couldve done these with a warm temperature and one with cold lastlythey could have used regular water than distilled water
in order to replicate this experiment you would need the names of the samples you must use the measurements for the vinegar and the measurements amounts for each sample
some additional information the group could add is how much vinegar your supposed to put in each container in addition this group could also include the size of the container theyre using finally i think they should have been a little more specific with their steps
in order to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is what do you use to measure the mass tell it in your procedure tell the reader how much vinegar to put in each of the containers in step 2 also tell the reader where do you place the containers after they have been rinsed do you place them in a cold area hot area or room temperature this could mess up the experiment if you are not told this
identify what are the four rocks they are going to use and if its all different shapes also tell if the contaners are the same size or not
i think that they need to show how many cups they have the amount of vinegar and how much of the materials that they are using for there experiment
the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four different samples so i can test the same thing the seconds to saw vinegar to pour into the containers all the samples have the same quality level you say this is to say now long tonne earn sample so the vinegar can wash off
there is a lot of additional information one would need to repeat this experiment first the students should include the different names for the four samples in order for proper replication furthermore the students should include the amount of vinegar that should be poured into the containers the size of the sample should also be indicated in the procedure furthermore it would be best if the size of the container was provided in the procedure
acid rain p will repeat some samples make data and check if the experiment is correct
in the procedure it is not included how they determined the mass of the samples or what the samples were step 3 also it is not stated in step 6 how to determine the mass the temperature of the distilled water is not defined at constant in step 4 the location or temperature of the place where the four substances in step 4 are not defined nor the temperature of where they are drying in step 5
the additional information that i would need would be the materials so that we would know what we need to do the experiment we need a desk explanation as to why we are determinig the mass of each sample
additional information that i would need inorder to conduct this experiment is what different kinds of samples how much vinegar to pour into each cup and also what to label the cups if i dont have any of this my experiment wont be valid i need to know the independent and dependent variable and whats has to be constant another thing is what are we using to weigh the samples with
you would need to know what you are using what the samples are you would need to know what you are mixing the vinegar with such as if the cup is empty or if there is water or something in there and you would need to know when you start the experiment
in groups acid rain procedure the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the mass they started of in how long after to remove the samples from the container and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry
instead of vinegar they should put a different kind of liquid to test with also instead of leaving it for 24 hours leave it for 48 to see if there would be a certain change in mass also when samples are ready to sit and dry leave them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes
the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar temperature of the vinegar
i would say wood because the mass difference is 0on the starting mass is 112 so is the end of the mass 112
this group gave some of the information but not all because they didnt say how much viniger they put in the container and the only did 2 trail3 trail is what it needed to be and the calculation cannot be accura because how they going to leave it in over min and then come back the next day and give oe say has the got their calculations for are not enough into
1st you would need to know what is they were trying to figure not p 2nd you need to know what material they are going to use 3rd i would need  to know what there conclusion is
in order to replicate it would mean that you would be more detailed and tell if the object is a solid liquid or gas its state of form and if it can move or its unmovable and describe the item or what type of item it is
1you would need to measure the starting mass p 2you would need to measure the ending mass p 3you would need to measure the difference between the starting and ending mass
the additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is you would need to know the name of the samples that you putting in the container you would also have to label the sample when you remove them from there containers
the additional information i would need is how much vinegar i would have to put into each sample also in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of a sample i needed in order to accuratey results the group also needs a problem question becouse another scientist might want to know why someone wants to do this experiment and what the other scientist  was trying to determine or prove also i would need to know how many trials i would need to do
one thing you could change is the amount of vinegar the sample size and were you dry it because of the temp
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample was used how warm the vinegar is and how much vinegar to put 
additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed the size of the cups and also a control to see just how effective this experiment is
to replicate the experiment in the procedure they need to be more suspific as to say what the four different samples are they should also be more suspific on how they measure the mass the third thing they should do is told which material they were using and then said reapet steps 36 so that it is clearer and easier to understand
one piece of information would be how much vinegar to pour into the four containers another piece of information would be how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so all four containers dont have an advantage or disadvantage because of unequal amounts a last piece of info would be what temperature to keep the containers in
you would need to know what samples you are using how to determine the mass of them and what containers you must use
i would need to know
an additional piece of information you would need to replicate the experiment is the temperature of the enviroment the samples are in because they already have the starting mass ending mass and the time period
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar the group of students how poured into the containers secondly what kind of containers did the students use thirdly what expecting is in the sample itself
in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know what to weigh the objects that i am testing with i also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and also the unit of measure that i am measuring the vinegar with
after reading the groups procedure i think i  need to know p 1 how much vinegar did they pour into each containers p 2 is every containers get same amount of vinegar p 3 is every samples sit and dry in same environment
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what amount of each sample to use where to to dry the samples and how big the containers should be
some additional information would be what samples are going into the cups also how much of each sample are in a cup and why are they doing this experiment
this is not a clear statement of the experiments aclear statement of the problem would include an explation of why students were pavestigation and the fain
the mass is ending 94 and of the wood is 112 in who the two are difference at the mass and at wood because have different peso
in this procedure there are a esuple pieces of information that should be included they should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same amount for each sample also  it should tell you to record the data of starting mass they could tell you how long to rinse the sample and the names of the samples could be included in the procedure finally at the end of the procedure it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the masses
additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be to add more materials to the experiment adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment another peice of information to be considered would be to increase the time the materials are soaked in the vinegar this would probably have an increased affect on the materials another peice of information would be to do more trials this would help with pinpointing the exact affect vinegar has on these materials
the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are a balance scale how much space in containers and how much mass used
i would add water because it would be less lighter than the rest of the stuff
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container how to determine the mass of the samples and what type of vinegar is being used i would also need to know how to name and rinse each sample and how to dispose of the vinegar waste lastly for is important to know the texture and distribution of each sample a container for example if the limestone was crushed and poured in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster
in order to replicate this experiment u would have to try  use many different samples another way they can do this is to be more pacific on the data by telling us how many cups of vinergen is needed
additional information we would need is the type of samples in order to replicate the experiment knowing how much vinegar to add in four seperate identical containers would also need to know how to measure the samples masses all this helps to replicate the experiment
to replicate a better experiment the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is poured in each container if one container has more than the other more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results another factor they may want to change to the same weight and size of the material once again isnt going to give you good results lastly they shouldnt use the already used material to replicate the experiment some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker so those are all factors the group of students should add
the first piece of information that is nesessary to repeat this experiment if only given the procedure is what the four samples are we would also need to know how much vinegar to place in each container we would also need to know if the containers needed to be opened or closed during the twentyfour hour period
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know opromatly the size of the sample used so that i would achieve similar results i would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured into each of the four containers i need to know this because different amounts of vinegar may cause more or less of a change in mass another thing that i would need to know is the environment that the samples are to sit in the temperature and lighting could effect my results lastly i would need to know if the containers are covered or left open if they are left open some of the vinegar could evaporte thus effecting my results
they would need to explain how their experiment went so they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to soc determine the mass of each so this is how they should explain their experiment weve tested four objects in vinegar and the four objects were a marble limestone wood and plastic the mass of each were marble 48 limestone 104 wood 116 and plastic 72 when we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to 94 limestone 91 wood 112 and plastic 71 so the mass of the marble went down 04 limestone 13 wood 00 and plastic 01
what  additional information we will need is how much vinegar they used what kind of vinegar they used and how big and what kind of containers they used they should also have a control group plus they should tell for how big each sample is
in order to replicate this experiment the additional information that is needed is to record exactly how much vinegar needs to be poured into each container another piece of additional information that is needed is how to determine the initial mass of each sample it is also necessary to be specific and state exactly which material marble limestone wood or plastic should be placed into each container
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container you  would need to know what the four different samples were and you would need to know whether or not  to cover or put a lid on the containers
you need a grab for the chart
the procedure did not say what types of cocks shuld be used in this experiment the procdure also does not state hou much vinegar buc in the cups at the end of the procedure it should say repeat experiment for better results
they should have done more trials for each sample to make sure it is accurat also there should be the same amount of vinegar for each sample it should say put each sample in the same size contaner and cover the sample with vinegar or say how much vinegar to use
firstly the students need to be clearer with their procedurethe amount of vinegar to pour on the samples can dramatically alter the results so an exact amount is desireablehow big are the containers the size matters when replicatinganother necessity in replication of this experiment is the time used to rinse the samples they all must be the same
how much of a sample to put in the container also how much big were the containers and how much vinegar should be used
should try different samples for each container p another suggestion let it sit and dry for different time p another make sure is the same temperature
i think that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure tell what we were getting the mass of also they should have once more trials each  why this observation was being done
in order to replicate the experiment i would first need to know the amount of vinegar i needed to pour into the containers it would also be good to say what they are using to determine the mass of the i object whether it was a triple beam balance or an cetric balance finally in order to replicate the experiment they would need to tell me what the samore are because it all know is four different sample im not going to know they mean marble limestone wood and plastic
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use what form each sample is in and the type of vinegar that was used for the experiment
the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would first be how much vinegar to pour into the cups and the units in which to measure the rocks mass and vinegarthey would also have to include the purpose of the experiment so others understand the experiment better
in order to replicate the experiment more information could be needed the procedure would that base to
to be able to replicate the folowing experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to place  in each containeri would also need to know what samples to use where do i put the containers for 24 hours
the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar that goes in each cup also the need to list the material and they need to add the mass object w
you would need to have a control to determine what you are doing the experiment for the students would also need to have a dependant variable as well as a dependant variable the students also need to state what they are testing in the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four different samples were because they did not mention them in the procedure i would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container i would need to know how big the containers were
the three different peices of information you would need is what samples are you using for the experiment the second thing you would need to measure the mass on a scale before measuring it after the 24 hours and the third reason is subtract the starting mass from the ending mass to get the difference between them
some information i would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used what to measure the mass of he samples with and how long should the sambes be rinsed with distilled water
after reading the students procedure one thing i  would add is the amount of vinegar to add to each sample another thing i would add in the procedure is the size of the container they want the samples in and if they should be covered the last thing id have the students add to their procedure is the actual samples themselves so that the person can know what substances they are testing if all those things were done the experiment would go a lot smoother and the results would be a lot more accurate
the information needed to replicate this experiment is to identify the different samples and how to make them they would need to specify how much vinegar to pour into the containers also be more clear about the control in the experiment
the additional information you could add are how much of the vinegar do we add to the containers or what kind of vinegar to add because they dont say this in the procedure also when to start they dont tell you when to start or to end they only said after 24 hours remove the samples they also dont tell you how or when to record the mass of the object they just say rinse containers and let them dryalso they need to run two more test
you would need to know the age of the samples because if the wood is old and dried out itll absorb some of the vinegar
additional information the students should include ares 1 what is the problem they are trying to solve 2 list of materials 3amount of viniger
on order to replicate the experiment
after reading the groups procedure the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment includes how much of each sample to use because without having the same amount of sample you dont know wether the mass difference is due to composition or amount the same applies to the vinegar without knowing how much vinegar to pour into the cups one might be affected more because it has more vinegar in it than the others this can also apply to the distilled water without knowing how long to rinse or how much water to use one sample might be affected more
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know if there were any other factors while you left it sitting such as temperature sunlight also you need to know the independent and dependant variable
to complete this experiment again the cares of the samples should have been stated at the beginning with at knowing knowing what the samples are how are you suppost to experiment on them there should be a list of all the things that you will need during this experiment and there should be more details like what kind of measurement are you measuring the mass or what kind of container is it or were do you store the experiment for those 24 hours
a size of the containers types of containers p b amount of vinegar p c size of the samples
in order to replicate this experiment correctly you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the separate containersyou would also need to know what unit of measurement has to be used to measure the sample finallyyou would need to know what kind of containers were used and if they would effect the masses or the samples
in this lab the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment again you should have a control another think is that how many samples to put in one container also you would need distilled water
the three imost they had bettwhere how much vinegar did they use for the experiment also that they forgot to saw how big containers were and if they cover the container after they put the vinegar and materials
in addition i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the four containers also the size of the containers and how much of the sample was put into each container
some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be certain amount of vinegari would need to put into each cup exactly what materials i am to add in each of the four cups and also how to remove the samples from the containers
the additional information you need would be the materials needed for the experiment the problem that you are experimenting dependent variable independent variable and even a graph to explain their results better
they need the data to add of each experiment need hypothesys
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what are the different samples that i am investigating i would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples the group needs to clarify that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic and you measure the mass using a scale and in grams lastly i need to know how much vinegar to put in each container to replicate this experiment
in orderd to replicate this experiment the additional information required includesthe amount of vinegar poured into containersthe location where the containers were started and the instrument used to prepare the mass of sampleseither a laple temprereture digital scales
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container also how much water you place into each sample and you would need to record step 3 more clearly
to replicate the experiment i would first off need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples for the next step would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the pieces of material i would want to know how exactly to rinse the seperate slabs at the end and then know how to measure the mass of the seperate samples at the end as well
this procedure is not descriptive at all wedont even know what to use for the first step it also doesnt say the exact amount of what everything should be the last mistake it states to label but we are not sure of the exact name so all of these mistakes would need to be fixed
to replicate the experiment i would need to know what samples i am sopost to use how much vinegar im sopost to put in these samples and what im supost to look them
you will need to write a hypothesis on the experiment and a conclusion on what happened and a graph on the changes that the experiment went through
to replicate this experiment i would have to know what kind of container they used and the size of it also i would have to know where i should remove the samples to after 24 hours
they should have wrote in the 4 different sample telling us what they are also they told us to determine the mass but they didnt tell us to fing the difference in mass from the starting mass to the end mass
to replicate the experiment again i would need to know how much vinegar used i would need to have a control group like marbles limestone wood and plastic placed in a distilled water esp for 24 hours to test my results again and lastly i would need all the materials to weigh the same before starting the experiment
you would need to know how much vinegar they used and what shape the samples were in i if they were all marble shaped the results would very from a jaged figure
i would need them to explain to me how they got the conclusion mass of the 4 samples p then i would tell them to include procedure step by step throught the exsperiment p how much acid rain was need to effect the mass
to replicate this experiment you will need to know the name of the materialhow much vinegar to actually pour in the containers what is the name of the sample material
to replicate the experiment the group would need to state the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into the containers the group also needs to state if the containers should be covered and at what temperature the containers should be stored
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what is the statement that they are trying prove also how much vinegar was added to each container finally each starting mass should be the same
it would be very helpful if you knew what the mass was at the end of the expiriment it also should show exactly how much vinegar you should pour into each container in that case you can have an exact amount each time also it would help to know how much marble limestone wood and plastic we have in each container
some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be what you would use to find the mass how much vineger to pour in the containers and where should the samples lit for 30 minutes in the heat in the reid
to replicate the experiment more information is needed such as the amount of vinegar in each cup what the samples are how long the samples should be rinsed and clearer directions instead of saying  pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers explain how much vinegar and whether cups should be large or small the experiment procedure needs to be more specific so that more trials can be done exactly the same or as close as possible for a more accurate conclusion
some additional information that they would need to replicate the experiment is to add the starting mass with the ending mass then they get an answer and then they divide that answer with the answer in the distance in mass numbers
the next time this group did this experiment they would get more accurate results by measuring and recording the amount of vinegar poured into each container they should also record the temperature of at which the containers are stored this information will improve the accuracy of the results and will make it easier to repeat the experiment
to replicate the groups procedurethe students will need to tell how much vinegar goes into the identical contaicee also they would need to tell how much distilled water would need to be added
in this groups  procedure you wuld need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in container and also what kind of container also they could add what temprature they left the material in the containers
after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinegar was needed how big was the sample pieces and did need to be close to sunlight or just room light
to replicate this experiment well you would need to know more information the procedure did not tell you how much vinegar to put in each container the procedure also didnt explain that you should weigh the samples in grams before you begin an experiment that is replicated may not always be exact but the important information should be included
in order to replicate the experiment additional information needed would be the volume of vinegar also the procedure should say if the containers are covered or uncovered finally it should specify what the samples should dry in like a petri dish to avoid contamination
one thing thats need to be done to the procedure is get safety goggles because its always important to be safe another thing thats needed to be put is gathering materials you need also the last thing to be done is when your finished with an experiment clean up your area
some additional information i would like to add to this acid rain experiment is to tell what amount or how much vinegar to place in the containers another  suggestion is to add more detail to the first step by agknowledging what samples we have to determine the mass or they might also want to include what or how to determine the mass of each of the samples
additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be to know what the four different samples are that are being tested another piece of additional information needed is the amount of vinegar being poured in step 2 one other piece of additional info would be how long to rinse the samples in distilled waterand what temperature the water should be at while rinsing
a proceder that i would put in that after they all dryed then i out them on a balance beam scale and then add 4 different mass from starting mass
additional info needed to replicate the experiment are say what sample types your using i tell you how to set up the cups and describe about the samplesif the group did these things i would be able to copy this experiment
this is a good procedure to follow only it lacks of some problems towards the end which cause the experiment to completly go wrong because of the fact that you will be unable to finish the investigation i myself would not change but rather much could a step or two by the procedure for example it is necessary to comprare all the answers with one another by subtracting and seeing each others differences and 8 depend exparament al least three times to see if it is valid
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four seperate but identical containers i would also need to know what the four samples were even though it is stated in the data table it is not stated in the procedure where it should be stated another thing would be helpful to know is what types of container i should i put the samples in so that i can replicate the experiment the same way they performed it
after reading the groups procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is specify types of materials like what kind of wood or plastic did they use because there are different kinds i would also need to know how much vinegar to use for each material because that information was not given and using different amounts of vinegar can affect the results
additional information you would need would be your independent variable dependent variable control and you would have to form a hypothesis the independent dont variable is what you control and the dependent variable depends on the iv
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what materials were being used in the procedure the group wasnt clear on what substances they were using also the group needs to tell you to find the difference between the 2 mases they were not clear on that in the procedure
you would need to know how much vinegar to put in what samples you would use and what the independent variables could be
first they would need to list the four sample names so i know what i am working with second list down the mass of each sample finally list down either you put samples under heat cold where 
first are they didnt fell you to put on your safety gageles then they determine the mass of four different samples are of what to use to get the mass with the next step it doesnt say what kind of containers to use glass or metal or raind or savare i also dont know what to label do you put it on a paper tawel to dry also because it doesnt say how to
in order to replicate this experiment you will need to know how many pieces of each sample are going to be added you would also need to know the conditions of the resting place because they can affect the experiment in addition it would also be useful to know how the amounts are being measured
in order to replicate the experiment additional information i would need  would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container to make sure there is only one independent variable the material the amount of vinegar in each cup must be the same also the temperature of the room should be identified because it have a possible effect on the outcome last the volume of each material needs to be specified should be identical
in order to complete this experiment they need to inquire measurements of how much vinegar to put in the cups and how much of each sample should go into the cup also they forget to tell you to get a starting mass so you are capable of finding the difference between the starting and ending mass
in the groups procedure they need to add additional information they need to add 1 gather materials then they should list the materials needed2 list the 4 different samples also they should add5record data they should add these three things because you should write a procedure very detailed because some people might not understand
i would need to know what kind of samples will i need i would also need to know how much vinegar should be poured into the containers most importantly im going to need to know what to use to figure out the mass
you would need the names of everything and the numbers that go with it so that everyone understands what youre trying to explain to them
to make the experiment able to be replicated there can be a different amount of time there can also be more containers which lastly there can be different placements such as one container can be in the sun another can be in the shade or simply there can be a temperature differences instead of measuring the mass all these factors can make this experiment reprodurable
additional information i will need in order to replcate this experiment is how long you leave the vinegar in the four different samples how many times you have to do it for and how you measure the mass
we need more starting mass ending mass  difference in mass  then test it all over
it is a good statemen ot the problem cause is showing u every thing they did and every color temperatur after s minutes and every temp after 16 minutes
i think in order to replicate the experiment you would have to change the data recorded for this experiment
in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what the samples are of we would also need to know why we are massing these samples what are we trying to find thirdly we need to know where to put the containers the environment must affect the experiment in one way or the another
i dont know
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what materials to use also how much of each material for example step 2 indicates to pour vinegar in container how much vinegar should i pour another thing i would need to know how to determine things and it what units i should for example step 1 indicates to determine the mass of four different samples it also never specifies type of samples
you need to know what the samples are p you need to put the starting mass of the samples and record the ending mass
they would need to include how much vinegar they are pouring into each containers name the samples that they are going to use min their procedure and they should also say if they have any constants those are some ways in which their procedure would be well
additional information needed would first be what the four different samples are also how much vinegar to pour into each containers in the procedure it says to place sample in a container since they havent said what samples there are people wouldnt be able to replicate this experiment theres  not enough information and that wouldnt give the most accurate results
to begin with the procedure should state how much vinegar should be used in the cups also it should specify merisseds or materials in this cups
what is the reasoning for doing this experiment what kind of container should we use what should we use to determine mass before and after
in order to replicate this experiment it is necessary to know exactly how much vinegar was put into each container also what type of containers were used also what would need to be known is how much water was used to rinse it off
in order to replicate the experiment some additional information i would need would be what the 4 different samples were i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in the cups lastly i would know how much of the sample i would be weighing whether it be 50z or 51bs the sample is not clear in the procedure
to repeat this experiment you would need  have valid data a control and more trials also i would put the four samples of vinegar in different environments such as a refrigarator or incubator to see if the data would be affected
the students could include what the four samples actually were the students should also label the identical containers so they dont get mixed up the students should also include what device theyre finding the mass of the samples with the students should also include how much vinegar should be poured into each container
you will need the same amount of the experience because it is the main part of the experience and also measure haw much sample or vinegar you using and watercheck it out often times to see if anything will happen
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used what temperature the room in which the samples were and how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample  another factor you should know to replicate the experiment was if the corner used was dark or if sunlight touched the rocks during the experiment
the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is 1 how much would all the samples weigh p 2 how much vinegar do i pour in the containers and 3 where would this experiment take place what kind of surroundings and environment
in the experiment limestone has the most different in the mass wood didnt change at all the mass stayed the same wood had highest starting and ending mass to make this experiment better they could of had more trial
you would need to include how much vinegar you need to put in the containers they also need to include the formula for determining the mass also they need to include how much material we need
to replicate this experiment you would have to no the amount and mass of the vinegar you would also have to no the temperature of the vinegar and the temperature when the stones were drying another piece of information needed is the ph of the vinegar you would also have to no what type of wood used in order to replicate the experiment you would also have to no the type of plastic
to replicate this experiment you would require a few more pieces of information for example how much vinegar to put in that piece of information is never mentioned in the procedure and it is very important to ensure validity another piece of information needed is a supply list it is never stated with what you are supposed to determine the mass and the only supplies mentioned are the 4 containers and an unidentified amount of vinegar also where the containers should be kept is never mentioned because if they are stored incorrectly it might cause the experiment to be invalid
additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment is we would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container
the students could have said how much vinegar they put into the containers they also could have said how big or small the containers were
some additional info that i would need for this experiment is the temp that they would have the containers in also another piece of info i would need is how much vinegar i should put in and last info that i would need is should the room i leave them in be light dark or should it be moderate all this to make the experiment reenactment accurate
the group of students should have mentioned in their procedures what four samples to use in the experiment otherwise the experiment wouldnt be able to be replicated because we dont know which sample to use also they shouldve mentioned the amount of vinegar that shouldve been poured in each of the four containers so we know how much to pour in they should also have mentioned whether or not we had to record the difference in the mass of the samples or not
to replicate this experiment you would need to have a starting mass of marble limestone wood and plastic to do this you would also need to use the groups procedure
to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the four different samples are you also need to know the starting mass for each sample how to determine the mass of each sample and where to keep the containers for the 24 hours
in step number 5 you should specify where to let the samples is and dry make sure it is not too cold or too hot in step 2 you should include how much vinegar to pour into each container in step 1 and 6 you should describe how to find the mass of the samples
in order to replicate the experiment there needs to be how much vinegar to use
in the group procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each containerhow to determine the mass and what to label each container in order to replicate the experiment
when the tell you to determin the mass of four different samples they should say starting mass in step two they should say how much vinegar to pour into all containers the should include determine the ending mass
you would need to know what kind of samples to use how much vinegar is used and how to dry them
after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate is one must add three things such as amount of vinegar poured into the containers need a scale and a type of vinegar
i would neet to know the samples a discription of them in order to do the investigation in order to make it clear and understandable
i would need to get a lsit of all the different materials i would also had to know how much vingar to use also one else ending results might not be as others i would also need to folow how much
yowd need to know how muchvinegar was poured into each sample youd needto know how much of each sample youd need how long should you rinse it
the students have neglected to include the amount of vinegar and it is hard to replicate the lab without measurements the students should also include other trials and also if the vinegar needs to be replaced these are important to procure correct results
you would need to find out what the mass is question 1  we would also need to know what the remaining samples are question 2 lastly we would want to answer question 6 and find out the mass
to repeat this groops procedure you would need 3 additional pieces of information p              1 the amount of vinegar to put on the sample p               2 the amount of each sample that you need p                3 the amount of distilled water to rinse each sample
reading the groups procedure it should have been more thorough for me to replicate that experiment they needed to included in their procedure the 4 types of samples that were experimenting onthe amount of vinegar used in their experiment the types of containers that were used and the size of each container they also needed to include the name of the sample that should be poured into container and also which container also where were the containers left to dry the temperature of the atmosphere outside or inside for me to be able to replicate this experiment
you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into the containers another thing you would need to know is how much of a sample you put into the labled container finally at the end you should use the same amount of distilled water to rinse off the vinegar at the end
in order to replicate the experiment the group would need to specify in number one the four different samples in step 3 they need to specify which sample goes into which containerand lastly they should add another step which should state that they should run atleast 3 trials so that their information could be accurate
the additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is 1i have to get all the ingredient for the experiment 2 later  i have to put all the ingredients to ge ther and i have to show how  to prepare the experimentsthen ii all the ingredient and i have to know how to prepare the experiment and later i have to give the time necesary and for the end i have to check was what the result
first you have to determine the samples name predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked at the end of the procedure compare them to your prediction
in order to replicate the experiment they would need to determine the mass of the four different samples 2 times of four vinegar in each of four seperate but identical container 2 times nextplace a sample of one material into one container 2 times then repeat with the remaining samples and place a single sample into a single container after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min then determine the mass of each sample
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four containers the amount of vinegar would affect the difference of mass and time also i would need to know what kinds of containers it use for placing the samples in some containers might not allow enough room for the samples lastly i would need to know how much distilled water i would need to rinse the  substances withthis could change the difference in mass
to improve the groups experiments they would need to add to the procedure how they found the difference in masses also the group should include clearly when the started recording and when they stoped recording finally to improve these students labs i think the should expain the list of materials they were using and its size
one thing we would need to know in the procedure is how much vinegar to pour in the containers if we dont know how much vinegar to put in the results would end up differently another thing we would need to know is what size of container to put the vinegar in we would also need to know what object to put in what amount of vinegar
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was present in the containers and the size of the rock sample to assure that the rock came in contact with the same amount of vinegar on its surface in both experiments i would also want to know they type of vinegar so i could use the same kind
in order to replicate the lab that the students made the procedure for you would have to know what kind of materials you are using for the practical to place in the vinegar also you would need to measure what after placing below you should go through before including the labs you also need to know how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to use
in order to replicate this experiment they should also put so the procedure how much vinegar so the amount of liquid is equal where they should sit  dry a window canter if its on anything under a light etc how do you rinse it with distilled water also you use soap let it sank to get vinegar out or do you dump water on it then let it dry
the exact amount vinegar poured in each container how to measure the amount of mass each has
the amount of vinegar the temperature of the room and the marble should be the same size
you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the different samples you would need to know also what one marene you put into the container and label and you would need to know exactly what material you put  with each samples
the groups procedure is although somewhat thorough hard to replicate in order foreach sample to get the same treatment and be as accurate as possible you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers you also would need to know how much water to rinse with the right factor is also important the students should be more specific about where the samples should be put rather light or dark because this effects the outcome
some additional information needed to repeat this process would be how much vinegar to put in each container if we should let the samples sit in room temperature or in hot and colder area new to determine the mass and how much of each sample should we place into the single container
they didnt come up with conclusions they problem thesis
the additional information from the procedure is what the samples are it tells you in the table but you wouldnt be given that along with the procedure secondly you need to know what containers you should be using lastly you will need to know what the materials are and also how to determine the mass of each sample
in the groups procedure instead of just saying a container say what kind and its size the procedure needs to include what you see to weigh the samples the procedure needs to be more specific with the samples i would need to know if i had to treat each sample differently
i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the different samples i would also need to know in what kind of container because the material can effect the outcome and whether to leave the containers in room temperature or in the heat
after reading the groups procedure the information that i would add would be to determine how much material i would add to one cup i would also need to know how much distilled water is needed in the cup after doing that i would also need know how much vinegar is allowed in the cup
to replicate the experiment  i  would  need to know how much vinegar i need to put into the containers i would need to know how to measure the mass in
you would need to know that you have to mass it before you do anything and you have to mass it after the whole expirement you need to know how much vinegar to pour on the samples
the group should specify what are the four different samples more information is needed on what should be done to the samples during the 24 hours also we need to know what kind of instrurrent is used to measure the sample
one thing that you would need to know is how much vinegar your using another thing would be how your going to weigh these materials lastly you would need to know exactly what your looking for in these materials  such as if they  dissolved or grew
in order to demonstrate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each cup you also would need to know how to determine the mass which would go in the first step of the procedure the samples also should be rinsed with the same amount of water which should also be in the procedure
the additional information that needs to be added to the procedure is what are they measuring everything in also we would need to know what size containers they used small medium or large plus where are they removing the samples from we would need to know that before we even start the lab last how are we going to find the mass by a triple beam balance the procedure needs more information or we cant even start the lab
additional information you would need would be why they are doing this experiment purpose statement more trials of the experiment and a control
first you would have to say what the samples have to be  you also have to say how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers should be
i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container where are we going to put the containers so they get the same amount of heatsunlight how long should you rinse it for
i would need all four samples ad the old results and vingar also water and containers
you would need to know how much of the sample was used also you would need to know how much vinegar was used and lastly you would need to know how big the conde is used and put the samples into
the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is the mass of the cup used if i were to measure the material in a cup the cup also has a mass so you will have to substance that one also you would need to know the actual names of the sample being used the procedure does not include that information and that is vital to havthe other thing that i would to know is how much vinegar to the top of the container specified just a little bit
some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is first off how mach vinegar to pour in each container using to much or to little vinegar can skew the results secondly i would need to know in what condition i should plac the container in it is possible heat and light may alter the results finally i would need to know if the containers should be covered or not the samples being exposed to oxygen can also alter the results
1if put not show wait so lable p 2 how long we p 3expt more about the
in order to repeat this experiment on my own the group of students should have first off talked about what the four samples they were testing were also they should have told us the amount vinegar that was needed to be used in each sample and lastly they should have explained in their procedure to calculate the difference in their starting mass and ending mass
in order to replicate this experiment i will need to know more information such as how much vinigar in each of four seprate containers and how long the experiment is pecific mersurements will help also
in step one i would need to know what the four samples were that i was determining mass of in step two i would need to how much vinegar to pour into the containers i would need to know what temperature to place the samples at in step 4
youd need a stop wacth youd need to be there at the exact timeleave the mass
after reading the groups procedure one piece of additional information that would need to be included to replicate their experiment would be including the names of the four different samples that are being tested another piece of information should be that in steps 1 and 6 that you make sure to record each separate mass and not just determine them a final piece of information should be how much vinegar to pour in
the additional information needed in this experiment is minimum of three such as in number in number two they should tell you how much vinegar should be added in the four separate containers also when they say to put the sample material in the container they should say if there is a size limit most of all to find out the mass you need to show what unit they measured in so you can get the correct or some data as them
in order to replicate this expierement i would need to have all the materials that are found in this procedure i would then gather all of my materials and follow the procedure and also record my data down on a piece of paper in expierements i always like to bring a watch for timing the samples just in case there are none around
after reading the groups procedure i would need more specific information to replicate the experiment first the procedure says to pour vinegar in each container but it does not specify how much should be used also the procedure doesnt say what size container i would use for each of the containers used in the experiment last the procedure doesnt say where i should pour the residue after the rinse
after reading the groups procedure i then figured out how they could replicate it they could change the amount of vinegar they put in each sample also they can record the room temperature to see if it changes within the 24 hours finally they can change the type of water that they use in step 4 to make a difference
in order to replicate this experiment i would need the mass of the containers a description of the container and a control in order to maximize the accuracy of the data
to replicate the experement i would need to know the problem of the experiment what the mass of the sample has to do with the experiment and what the marble limestone wood and plastic are for
in order to replicate the groups procedure you would need to know the amount of vinegar they used they would need a control group and the amount of distilled water used to rinse the materials they also need amount of time in distilled water more trials could be done for accuracy
first the procedure needs is specific which materials are being used as sample in the procedure there was and mention of the samples being marbles of any kind also the procedure doesnt a tempt to control the amount of vinegar in each container this is necessary to replicate the experiment as different volumes of vineea eased after the estume the procedure finally needs to keep the size of the marbles constant surface area may be a factor in the experiment
after reading the group procedure some additional information that should be added is to list what numbers steps that you have to repeat because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat another one is to list out the materials it has no information on what materials are being used only in the data table which was done after the experiment next thing they should add is the amount of vinegarwater etc that is need for the experiment for all trials and lastly they should be specific about where to put  thing for example where do you put the materiasl often washing them off
after reading the groups procedure 4 things that would need to be added are that they would need to identify the four different samples they would need to tell you the amount of vinegar to put in each cup they would need a control and lastly they would need to do multiple trials in order for it to be a valid experiment
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container it doesnt tellyou how much vinegar you need also i would need to know the size of the samples should they all be the same size or different it doesnt tell you what size the samples should be the last piece of information i would need is what the samples even are the procedure doesnt tell you which materials to even use
i would need to know what kind of container the sample were put inand the amount of vinegar poured on the samples also the kind of vinegar
in the groups procedure they do not include some details that are crucial for the experiment to be repeated first you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container you would also need to know how much of each sample was put into each tube you would also need to know if the experiment was repeated to see that there was no errors accidentally happened and you would need the name of the sample that you are useing
one thing that they dont say that you need to replicate the experiment would be how much of the samples to use the procedure dosnt say that you need to find the difference in the masses
in order to repeat this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar they poured into the container for each sample i would also need to know what kind of marble wood and plastic they used since there isnt one kind of each it would be useful to know what containers were used and hou long they rinsed the samples for
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what to use to determine the mass of the 4 different samples since it does not state that in the procedure also the samples of the items should be added in because you have no idea what you are testing if they are not in the procedure also there should be a given amount of vinegar in the procedure not a vague description not having the same amount of vinegar in all 4 containers could affect the experiment
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers also i would need to know how long to rinse the rocks with distilled water  without those pieces of information i could not precesily replicate the experiment
another piece of information you might need is how much distilled water is used also if you are using the same amount of each sample even maybe how much vinegar you are using on each sample
the additional information you would need to replicate the expirement wald be an accurate mesurement of vinegar being pared into the containers also an accurate measurement of the distilled water you would uses for each container to rinse it off after 24 hours
for this groups experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i need in each cup  i also do not know what the four different materialssamples are so it would be nice to have some ideas they should also put down to try this two or three times all together  so we have more than one of the tables to read
there are three pieces of additional information that could be reach to replicate the experiment in steps 1 and 6 they say that they determine the mass of the samples we must know how they do the or what ri they use also in steps 2 they say pour vinegar we must know how much vinegar to put into each container lastly in step 4 they say to rinse each sample we must know for how long or what methods were used to accomplich this
to replicate this experiment you would need a specific amount a vinagar you would also need to know what the 4 samples were you also need to have water in the containers containing the vinagar
what information i would need would pcobbaly be marble limestone and wood
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you are supposed to put in each of the four containers another information that you will need is whats the sizes of each of the four containers because when you put the vinegar it has to be on equal amounts and if you dont know the sizes of the containers it will affect the experiment
in this experiment the procedure did not tell us what the four materials were they never told us how big the containers should be and after pouring vinegar into the containers why would you get another container to put them in it was very confusing
first you would need to gather your materials then because safety is first make sure you are ready with goggles and gloves after you organize yourself you then determine the mass of four different samples and so on after the experiment you complete your data with the following information and a graphchart
the students needed to explain what samples they were using in the procedure they needed to say how much vinegar to use and what type of vinigar to use
you would need to know how much vinegar to put in the cup how much sample for each cup and how much distilled water to use to rinse with you must know all these measurements or the experiment could be wrong the data could be wrong which would the make your lab report  conclusion wrong
what kind of containers are needed what are the four different samples  how much vinegar do you put in to each container
i would pour the vinegar in nonidentical container so you could know which is which you could measure how much you put in to the cup or containers they could have done the trial more than once to make it was correct
marble limestone and plastic all absent in the negetives in differences
in order to replicate that experiment you need to say what 4 different samples you are using you also need to say how you are going to label the cups in measuring the 4 different samples you need to say how to mease you lastly need to mention the materials you need to use for that procedure
to make this procedure complete there should be specification about how big the containers are there should also be specification about how much vinegar you pour in these containers lastly saying how you determine the mass of each sample hey
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to add what the four examples are in the procedures that way the experiment know what theyre working with you would also include a control and independentdependant variables also take observations
you will need to know exactly what materials are needed you must also know how much vinegar to put in each cup also the starting weight of each
1what shape the samples were p 2what type of vinegar was used p 3what type of marble limestone wood and plastic was used
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar is being put into each cup the specific types of plastic wood limestone and marble and how long the samples were rinsed for
in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know need to knew how big each container was the holds the samplesi would need to know much vinegar to put in each container also i would need to know how to measure the mass of the 3 objects
i would need to know the materials that are going to get measured the amount of time that each material stayed in the vinegar the staring mass and the ending mass of each material
the information needed would be what is trying to be proven with this investigation also they would need to state what the original samples are  thickness of each original sample
i will need a balance to weight the mass of four different samplesreplace vinegar for lemon and put in each four edenticallyafter 24 hours i will use water to rinse each sample after i will use the balance to check if there is any change in the mass of each
additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is that i would need to know what measuring tool to use in order to weigh the samples triplebeam balance i would also need to determine the difference in the mass of the samples the group showed the difference on their data table but didnt list that step in their procedure lastly i would need to record every different mass on the data table which also isnt a step in the groups procedure
in addition to the procedure in acid rain experiment they forgot to state their hypothesis but in the beginning they also forgot to state their materials such as marble limestone wood  plastic in their procedure or how much vinegar in each solution
what the procedure is asking is for them to find away how to make acid rain yo will need containers to hold the rain then your will need to label the containers after 24 hours they will be ready to then find out the mass
the additional information i will need in order to replicate the experiment is the procedures so i know what im doing the samples so i know what im working on then starting mass
one thing someone would need is which materials they are testing if the procedure doesnt include marble limestone etc then it cant be replicated the procedure should also include  how much vinegar to put into each container because of this faster mass not controlled the experiment wont be valid finally the students need to add where to keep the containers because different environments can affect the results they get for each
i would need there 1prediction to what they were really questioning i would probably say the date and time also including there conclusion
they did not look up data about acid bain and they need t
in order to replicate this experiment first of all the samples would need to be identified as samples of  they should start out at roughly the same mass as well the amount of vinegar should have been constant for each container how were the containers labeled numerically or by name
the information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the samples and container sizes also you need lables to identify each sonified container the same amount andend of vinegar and water finally the same amount of time and creat a lable the somewhere
some additional information i would need to complete the experiment would be to know what the samples are in the procedure also i would need to know how big the containers need to be and how much vinegar to pour in also i would need to know what temperature the samples need to be at also if they are covered or uncovered then i would need to run a control of water on the samples and run the experiment multiple times
in order for me to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinigar to pour in with the stonesanother thing i would need to know is what are the four materialsno where in the procedure is there names of stonesanother would be how much of the sample to use in gramsnowhere in the procedure is there an indication of the mass
they will need to include how much vinegar to put into the containers they also need to make sure that the samples have the same orrigional mass i will also need to know what the control is and how many times re repeat the experiment for valitity also how long should we nase  the samples for
to do this experiment you need to know how much sample to put in a cup the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the cup with the sample in it and how many trials to do the experiment
for me too replicate this experiment the additional information i would need is were did they sit the container did it sit in the room  freezer werethey all so could of told use if they used move traits or not
this procedure can be improved you must keep everything constant including the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment multiple trials would prevent many errors from being recorded because there would be materials to keep the numbers in the appropriate range a control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample the corrections will make the lab much more accurate
you will need marble limestone wood because they the variable pieces in this experiment you will need to experiment with all of there
in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know what size the containers need to be also  you need to know what are the containers bowls plates cups and you would also need to know to determine the mass of each sample
i would like to have known why were they doing this experiment and why didnt or the samples get compare with warer by the vinegar
well first a problem statement would be helpful knowing there independent and dependent variable also knowing their controle group would have helped
in order to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar to put into 4 seprate containers i need to know what material to use so without the information that i listed i would not be able to do this experiment 30 minutes it was done the first time with the information that they left of was in there then i would be able to replicate this experiment
i would need to know how much vinegar is to be put in each container i would also need to know how long i had to rinse each item i also need to know what the samples were dried on
in order to replicate this experiment the procedure would have to say which samples to use it actually only says place a sample of one material into a container i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container the procedure only says pour vinegar in each of four seperate but identical containers for this step i would need to know what size of containers i should use for the experiment i would also have to measure each sample before and after doing the lab so i would add that to my procedure
additional information i com to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in the containers how many rocks should be placed in the container and how large the containers should be this additional information would help me to replicate the acid rain experiment
the group would need to tell me what type of container to use am i using a bucket a beaker or what do i put all the materials in separate containers at the same time or do i wait until the first one is finished to start the second one what am i removing the samples with my hands tongs what this is the additional info needed to replicate this experiment
i will need to no what are the names of the four different samples im determarning the mass i will also need to no what units am i measuring by but last but not least i will need to no how big is the container is
what could be added to this groups procedure is they could perform more trials so that they could get more results they also could find a control so that they could compare all of their answers to now the control was affected and they also could move vinegar the four different samples right after they took them out of the vinegar because the water could have had as affect an their accurate
further information would include why or what purpose the students were conducting the expirement what size the samples were and explain why each sample is a different mass p the purpose was to record and compare the mass of each sample
in order to replicate this experiment you would need is to know how many containers we would need
to replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because it doesnt give a specific amount we would also need to know how much water we need to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hours also we need to know what we are determining the mass with because the procedure just says find the mass
one thing you should need to know would be to know what type of sample you would need to set if you dont know what sample to use then the experiment is useless also you should know how much of the vinegar to put into each of the containers and finally you should know what to weigh your sample on and if you should set the weigher to 0 before weighing it in you need to know what to weigh it on before there are many different weighing systems for biology and if you dont know which are to use then your lab might cam out wrong
first of all we would need to to knew what the four different sample are this way we can talk about it in our data and conclusion also we meed to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because that is a controlled variable lastly it never says to messure infroms so we do not know how much of the material we should be measuring
additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinergar to place with the samples also i need to know if there were certain temperature the samples needed to be placed in the last thing i need to know is what type of containers to put the samples in you dont know if the vinegar is going to affect the containers
in order for me to replicate the experiment i would need to know where the containers were kept for 24 hours also i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four separate containers last but not least i would need to know how much of plastic wood limestone and marbles to put into the containers of vinegar to repeat this experiment
one piece of information that would be needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinigar was added to the containers another piece of information needed is what kind of containers were used in the investigation finally the last poice of information needed to replicate the investigation is how long would the samples be rinsed with distilled water also how much water was used to rinse
you place the sample of one material container into one container and label repeat the sample iinto a single container after 24 hoursremove the dry sample and rinse each sample with distilled water allow the sample to sit and dry for 30 min
you would need to know the size of the containers what brand of vinigar was used so that there can be no change in data last you would need to know what it was weighed on
in order some to replicate i need to know how big each container was how much vinegar was poured on the the subjects also i would need each of the subjects to have the same mass show it would be more correct it it was all the same size
if i wanted to make the same kind of experiment i would pour vinegar in each of the 4 separate but identical containers then i would wait 24 hours then rinse each sample with distilled water finally allow all the samples to sit and dry for 30 min
in orderto replicate the experiment i  would need to know the 4 different samples used stated in the procedure i would also need to know what and why we are performing the experiment in other words the purpose and problem i would also need to have stated in the procedure to calculate the difference in mass
in order to replicate this experiment the procedure would need to be rewritten with more detail first a step to record the mass of 4 samples before placing them in vinegar would need to be added next the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be in each container another step they did not add was to relabel the samples after they are removed from vinegar in order to tell them a part from each other
after reading the groups procedure i would conclude that i will add a independent variable to the lab also i would want to place the containers in a constant temperature area for more accurate testing
