orbiting junk
grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor 
its a    tool bag
such an observation isnt as strange as it seems orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions this space junk is currently of great concern to government space agencies around the globe
what is space junk
in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite the united states followed suit and thus began the human races great space invasion
over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earths atmosphere they explore the vast reaches of our solar system monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless communication possible the rockets that are used to power these spacecraft typically fall back to earth and disintegrate in the intense heat that results from friction with earths atmosphere the objects themselves however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up in this airless environment some of them continue to circle the planet indefinitely while this is ideal for a fully functioning object that was launched for that purpose for example a communications satellite what happens when a satellite dies or malfunctions and cant be repaired the disabled object becomes a piece of hightech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit
crash course
with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other thats exactly what happened in february 2009 two communications satellites one american and one russian both traveling at more than 20000 miles per hour crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth the impact created hundreds of pieces of debris each assuming its own orbital path now instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space 
its not only spectacular crashes that create debris any objects released into space become freeorbiting satellites which means that astronauts must take great care when they leave their spacecraft to make repairs or do experiments still accidents do happen in 2008 a tool bag escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs on the international space station iss 
little bits but a big deal
so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash 
actually many people do those bits of space debris present a very serious problem tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft if you find that hard to believe compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall at extreme speeds little bits can pack a punch powerful enough to create disastrous holes in an object moving through space 
scientists are hardpressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk both the national aeronautics and space agency nasa and the european space agency maintain catalogues of known objects the lost tool bag for example is listed as satellite 33442 but while military radar can identify objects the size of a baseball anything smaller goes undetected this makes it difficult for spacecraft to steer clear of microdebris fields accepting the inevitability of contact engineers have added multiple walls to spacecraft and stronger materials to spacesuits to diminish the effects of impact
yet the problem is certain to persist in fact the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution 
how does the author organize the article support your response with details from the article
the author orginizes this article by putting into a couple paragraphs that are organized that way to make it easier on the reader so that you can understand how dangerous space junk or microdebris is
by starting back in the 1950s also by their thoughts an other people thoughts
he says what it is and the first year they started doing he also talked about that different crash course you could have if you go up in space that you might want to bring tools with you just in  case somethimg happens
the author organizes the article by catching your attention with shocking statements made in the introduction  after that the author explains three different problems that space junk creates  at the end the author summarizes the article with a conclusion
she organizes the article by useing different headings when she talking about different things
the author organizes the article by first letting the readers know what space junk was how space junk is formed and what happens to the debris in space
it was very well put together becuase the author organized it into different sections he had a eye catching benning and the in between had different titles that caught your intrest talking about a certain topic
the auther organizes the article by first informing you about what space junk is like in paragraph 5 the second part is telling you what happens when two uncontrollable satilites do then the last part is telling you what happens what microdebris is and how it poses a threat to earth
the author does step by step in order to inform us the little           promblems to the real promblems that are bigand to let us no how certain things we need to pay attention to because its a big deal
the author organizes the article by breaking it up into sections first he has the introduction part of the article this introduces what his paper will be about then he has a subtitle that says what is space junk this section defines what his main idea is about and gives the reader a better understanding about his topic then he has crash course giving examples of previous times there has been crashes in space finally he closes his article with little bits but a big deal emphasizing the effects of space junk and informing the readers that this is a serious issue not to be taken lightly
the author organizes this article by giving us some information about space junk  what is space junk  then the author gives some information about how dangerous space junk can be crash course  finally the author gives us information about it dosent matter what the size is its the speed that does the damage  little bits but a big deal
the author organizes the article by opening with an introduction explaining the topic of space junk  the author then provides background information to allow the reader to better understand the problem  the author then brakes into two sections with more detailed information on the problem  the concluding paragraph expresses the need for a solution
the author organizes the article by telling about spacejunk and how it is made up in space and how it stays up there then he tells how you could be effective if you ran into space junk also if there little pieces it can still hurt you no matter how big they are
by telling about the history of space junk
it talks about what space junk is then it talks about times junk has been sent out to space eventually it talks about how space junk can be a serious matter
the author gives us a clear introduction at the biginning followed by the head lining what is space junk the author also continues to use headings to demonstrate diferent parts of the article
the author organizes hisher writing into different sections based on the importance of the issue the most common known issue with apce is the space trash and to show this the author placed all his information about space junk into the first subtitle then for all the information about satellites crashing and the small size of the space debris got placed into their own sub categories
the author breaks the article up into smaller sections  by doing this i believe it makes the article more effective and easier to read  it starts out by giving an introduction as to what the main idea of the article is going to be about and then goes farther into details  in the details it gives us actual examples of the space junk crashing into one another and making hundreds of microsatellites flying through space  then it gives us an example of how we my think a little tool box is no big deal but then it explains how it really is a big deal  then it concludes by trying to make us think of ways that space junk could be cleaned up in the future  i believe by organizing it this way it leads to a more effective and more interesting article
first he talks and informs us about the general idea of space junk what is space junk is where he basically tells us just a general idea about it then he tells us about crash course that is about how large objects or satellites may crash into each other little bits but a big deal is informing us about those articles combined kind of it talks about space debree and how to solve the problem it kind of wraps things up
this organized in a way that tells us about orbiting jank then it tell us what it could be it tells us next why things may turn into junk and orbit becusae some of the spacecraft may crash and thats the end of that
first the author gives a quick explanation of how space junk is created in the passage what is space junk here they explain that when satellites malfunction they become hightech junk in the next article crash course the author tells a story of a us and russian satellites colliding creating many debris finally the author explains the importance and dangers of space junk in little bits but a big deal in this article he explains that even though some debris are smaller than a baseball they pose a serious threat to spacecraft or astronauts
the author organize the article to help reader to keep reading the article gose from better to even better
the author organizes the artical well he puts things down by there importance uses tone of voice and organizes his thoughts well from the section orbiting junk he uses excitment for his tone of vioce in the section what is space junk he gives facts about what happend and how dangerous debree in space can be
the author organizes the article in parts he starts with an introduction to pull the reader in and then quickly changes the tone to show that he is still taking the article seriously
he starts with a joke then moves to the history of how we got to space next is satellites that are flying around dead up there and to end it up is the danger of small space junk
the author puts the titles on them which help because they show what the story may be about without them it wouldnt give you an idae on what your really reading
he organzie how it begins to get worst throughout the passage as he start with orbiting junk and ending with little bits but a big deal the author show that even through it little the problem is huge
first he talks about what space junk is and how it is made then he talks about how even little pieces of space junk can cause a lot of damage
the author organizes the articles by producing several different titles and layering supporting evidence with facts the introduction uses humor to convey the topic what is space junk gives a background as to how the the objects have muddled their way into the atmosphere crash course gives a more indepth look at exactly what objects have been found and what dangerous effects they can have little bits but a big deal expands on the need for a solution to the increasing amount of damage that has occured the author uses a structure of history cause effect and solution to reveal information
the author starts off trying to lure the reader asking a question then using the title crash course it is a good topic that we would like to find out what is going on then ends it out with little bitsbut a big deal saying that it is a little thing or topic but itis a very big deal in the world he just wants the reader to want to keep reading keep it intersenting
heshe prganizes it by category first explains what it is and then the dangers
the author organizes the article by the things that are floating around in space also that this space junk is a big deal then he explains what falls into the space junk category next is what happens to space junk and why it is such a bad thing such as the courses of the junk and the collisions they cause then more in detail about space junk that the little pieces are a big deal finally that space agencies are trying to find a solution to space pollution
he has a beggining body and conclusion he gets you interested and then gives serious information and then finishes off
the author organizes the article in a way that answers the readers questions as one would have them by putting everything under titled paragraphs the author first gives the reader background information on the problem  telling one what the problem is and how it came to be a problem in what is space junk  the author of the article then told the reader about the dangers of space junk and how they affect all things in space in crash couse  finally in little bits but a big deal the author tells of more problems that space trash causes and tells one how the problem is increasing and how it is trying to be stopped space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution  this makes for a well rounded article
the aurthor organize that article by putting different information in its own subject so that the reader can understand and lean about one thing at at time by putting the articles in there owns subject like what is space junk the reader can only read about what space junk is and not have to read about crash cousre cause thats in the next reading
the author organizes the article in sections based on the information found under each heading the author starts with the simple question what is space junk to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about the next two sections are about how space junk is made and what it can cause the order of the information makes sense in the human mind first tell us what it is second tell us how it is made and third tell us what it can do
he starts with information on space junk then eventually leads to the harms and dangers that come out of space junk
from the article you can see that he tries to get your attention in the introduction from there he intitiles one passage what is space junk and that passage tells what things could become space junk in the next passage intitiled crash course is explains what happens when 2 satellites collide into eachother going 20000 miles per hour then in little bits but a big deal he tells us what damages can occur when microdebris hit something from the speed from space
the author organizes the article by breaking bits of information down into its own section the first section titled what is space junk gives you a description of what the junk is and how all of it got there the second section crash course informs the reader that the free orbiting satellites are a hazard to earth because the satellites run a risk of colliding with one another in the last section little bits but a big deal informs the reader that it does not matter how big the pieces of debris are the section indicates that small fragments traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to the most carefully designed aircraft the author broke down the information and made it easier for the reader to find specific information that they are looking for
starts with a question than he gives the reader lots of information
the author organizes the article very effectively the introduction grabs attention with well known phrases  then they describe the subject so the reader understands exactly what is being talked about next the author demonstrates how it is created and finally he or she uses examples to demonstrate the severity of the issue  by titling each section the author makes the article easier to navigate and find certain information quickly it also organizes the information well
the author organizes this article very fluently first the author starts by adressing the concern of the space junk after describing the concern the author defines the meaning of space junk next the author explains how exactly space junk can be formed then last the author shows us the effect of the space junk and how even the smallest particles can do crucial damage to working satellites space ships and astronauts repairing a space ship
the author wants to tell the readers about  how space junk can effect space  for example how the space crafts go in space and may have to take another course because of junk foating around  it is organized with supporting details because it is giving examples of what is going on with the junk and how it causes probems
the author organizes this article by first catching your attention after the author has caught your attention he goes into an explaination of what space junk is and its harmful effects then the author explains what we could do to come up with a solution to space pollution
he makes sure that he explains what space junk is where it comes from and big of a problem it actually is
by the time and date that these things happened on for example he started out in 1957 and then moved to recent day
the author starts off with a piece of space junk in the air then he explains space elxploration then talks about satellites and finally explains the danger of space junk
the author has a very effective way of organizing the the article he first introduces the beginning with some startling statements to get your attention statements such as grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor 1       once grabbing the readers attention he breaks the article into several segments labeled what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal  all of the following are to condense the article into areas that focus on those specific ideas     by doing so it seems that the article was very effective in keeping the reader reading instead of organizing the article into just one big clump  having the organization that it did made the article easy to read and very interesting at the same time without leaving out any details
the author starts out with an introduction filled with shocking statements and some information to grab the readers attention the author then gives background information of how the space junk got into orbit the next section provides information on the dangers of space junk and debris in orbit the final section tells of the problems with the space junk and how scientists are working hard to find a solution
the author organizes the article by first explaining how satellites came to be and how bits and pieces from projects or experimnets from space stations get sent out into open space and became space junk from then on the article tells about how other bits of space junk can collide with each other and cause tons of damage other countries are also trying to get into space but the author of this article is worried that they are not aware of the dangers and lack of precautions they take when going forward with their plans
first the author explains to the readers what exactly space junk is he tells us that space junk is actually objects from space missions that have gotten left in the atmosphere then when he has deemed that the readers understand he gives examples of how this space junk is affecting us such as how when dead satellites are left in space they run the risk of colliding with each other finally the author brings home the point that space junk is very dangerous he explains that while the objects may be small when at extreme speed such as in space they could do a lot of damage
he organizes the article in what happens to space junk and what it isthen is talks about what happens to it and how it happes
to inform us on how harmfull space junk is
the author uses heading to organize his article his first heading what is space junk gives the topic of the following paragraphs through the use of headings the author ensures that the reader can understand the organization of the article with ease the author also goes in chronilogical order he starts in 1957 the year the soviet union launched its first satellite and ends in the presnet day
the author organizes the article by having sections of different information there are three paragraphs that each have their own information in each of them
the author puts the article in diffrent sections so thet he can keep better track of it and so that we can understand it better and so it all just isnt clutered up and hard to read
he starts with the introduction then he would go to space junk talking about how the satellites would be unuseful he goes to crash course little bits but a big deal to inform us of how dangerous it is
into diffrent articles relating one another by same subject but discussing diffrent matters
how does the author organize the article he organizes it in a good way he has a good introduction explaining the whole plot of the story then he gives acouple facts then after that he implies why those facts are important and what will happen if the problems continue to grow
he organizes rhe artice by piting his content into full paragraphs
it explaines how dangerous space junk can be like satellites and peices from a space craft
the article orbiting junk is organized into different sections to describe how space junk is created and the problems it creates the autor begins by getting the readers attention then they go on by describing what space junk actually is next the autor continues by giving a story about space junk and ends with telling the effect it has on the earth
the author has the article organized out itto material sections to help you
the author starts off in a more simple easy going way so that the reader can connect and understand what their talking about  next it changes to a more serious tone so that the reader understands the seriousness of space junk and the dangers that it holds  the author uses examples such as satellite 33442 to prove differnt times its happened in history
by  telling you what space junk is then telling you wat makes the space junk then going on to say how big of a deal the junk is
first the author provides friendly and simple observations to break the ice of the article second the author defines and explains the main idea of the article lastly the author changes to a more serious tone and explains how harmful space junk actually is
the author divided this article into sections the begining of the article is just an introduction that is suppose to grab the readers attention and help them to become intrested the next section what is space junk is the foundation of the rest of the article it is included to help explain in a simple form what is space junk why it is floating and how it was placed up there        the next section crash course is includede to explain how the objects could possible be dangerous and to tell what has happened in the past that has proved them to be a negative and danger little bits but a big deal is to explain how little objects can actually have a very large impact on the satellites it significanfies how it doesnt matter what size the object is it still creates a large problem     the author probably wrote this article this way because he wanted to but it into the sinplest form and explain all parts of the question
he has paragraphs for each one
in the introduction the author grabs the reader by making surprising statements he then however changes to a more serios tone to let the reader know that space junk is a significant matter he explains what is space junk by reviewing the history of satellite orbitals and explaining how pieces of satellites have broken off and gone into orbitals he then explains how satellites crash and how debris is broken off finally he explains the importance of space trash and finding a solution to the problem
the author organize the article by putting each name by orderin evey new paragraph the author has a new title
i think that the author organization is kind of messy but kind of not in the beginning he starts off with a wild introduction but that made me interested in reading it then he goes off talking about different topics making it pretty organized because atleast he has a title to make the readers know that they are going to learn something different
the author organizes this article by starting with  information and the first satellites and the harm of what a satellite could do when it malfunctions and cannot be repaired he then explains the risk of a satellite colliding with another  as well as the harmful effect of the debris from the satellites has on space the author concludes this article by explaining the fact that space will soon become to crowded causing a potential threat in the future
this article is devided into an intoduction followed by four paragraphs of supporting information a problematic supposition and finaly an alternate route suggestion and a summery of the article as a whole
the author has certain titles throughout the article to show what the topic is going to be
the author first grabs our attention with phrases that include exclamation points as he moves to the body of the article we are informed of what space junk is and how it has gotten to where it is the author then tells of how dangerous this space debris is to spaceships as well as the orbital paths of other things out in space he tells that although space junk may be small in size it has huge consequences in the end
the author organizes the article so that the introduction is about the history the body paragraph shows examples and the conclusion explains the significance of taking care of our space trash
the author organizes the article in sections  the sections help place specific topics into categories  this allows the reader to fully understand what the author wants the reader to know  the author creates four sections  each section has a different topic all under the same subject  these topics provide a wide range of information about space junk  the author also organizes the first section with a light conversation  then the author gradually becomes more serious by talking about the history of space junk
the author organizes this article by giving a description telling how it happens and giving the after effects  in the first paragraph the author mostly explains what space junk is and how it gets there  the author writes about earths satellites how they get there and what they do the second section explains the process of how satellites crash into eachother  it gives an example of when earth and russias satellites crashed and how they were completely disabled and useless making them space junk  lastly the third section tells the aftermath  it talks about the microscopic particles and how they are hard to detect even with our technology
the author organizes this article very well the introduction is attention grabbing and it makes people want to read the entire thing to learn about what is going on out in space there is a lot of information in the article but it is organized in a way that makes it interesting to read
the author starts off with a startatling sentence then starts to talk about how they are made and what they are made from he tells how long they have been around he tells some problems with them as well
he starts with a weird fact to get the readers attention then he adds some old history of space junk after that he puts in information about satellites colliding then to end it he proposes ideas to stop space pollution
he goes from the things that cause space accidents like space junk and explains them in great depth then the author goes on to explain what kind ofaccidents that sapce junk causes then it explains that small even microscopic bits of junk can cause a catastrophe
the author orders his articles in order of events he starts with space junk then goes to how big or small the space junk is then finally he finishes his article with how fast the space junk is going
the author organizes the article by first giving the reader some information about space junk and how it has become a problem as the story progresses it lists more information for us to know about space junk and how it dan be a major problem for spacecraft including telescopesk and satellites that have been sent beyond earths atmosphere
the author put titles about hisher starting paragraph to sort out the sections
the author organizes the article by putting specific ideas together  the author opens the article with an intense introduction but then settles down into a serious tone  the author procedes with one idea at a time describing was space debris is  the author ends the article with a reality reminder that space agencies need to work together and solve this problem
at first the author draws you in with the cliche superman knockoff line but then gets more serious through out the entire article he does an introduction a brief history of space exploration and what space junk is tells how dead or disabled satellites can crash into each other and then ends with hope saying coporations are trying to come up with a viable solution to space pollution
he starts off by telling about clusterd space is then he goes on to talk about how this can be a threat to earth for instance when two dead satellites collide it doesnt just make two things of debris in space it makes many microdebris that can hit the earth plane or even a spacecraft
the author organizes the article by breaking it down into sections and talking about different things in those sections like what is space junk and crash course
good her or she didi it good
the author organizes the article by first starting with an introduction that catches the readers eye the introduction also contains the thesis statement orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satalite missions next the author describes what space junk is and how it was created after that in the section titled crash course the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted finally in the last section the author talks about possible solutions and the persisting problem of space junk
the article is organized by first telling about space exploration and then it moves on to telling about space crashes that have actually happened after that it goes on to talk about how serious the debris is
the author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections the first section explains the main purpose of the aticle the second section explains how all of this space junk has gotten there the third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space the final section explains the dangers of the space debris and how the space agencies are trying to solve the probelm and prevent damage from space debris
first they used a catchy begining to start then they went into a little history and info on the topic in the what is space junk section from there they told of some of the bad that has happend like to satellites crashinginto one another then that opened up the topic of all the fragments that came from those two sattilites flying around in space
they did a great job oganising this article first they get your attintion with grab you telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor then they get right in to the article about the what is space junk
the author starts with an exciting introduction to lure the reader in next the author starts explaining the problems and why we should be concerned then the author persuades us to feel motivated
the author puts the selection in a story format to make it seem much more interesting and to make the story have alittle more detail when he did that he could grab the readers attention
the author organizes his article by putting useful information about whats going on in space or what has already happened the author grabs your attention by giving what was said in hishers class room then they go on to tell you important information for example of an important thing the author said is in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite these things theyve mentioned are important already
he puts it into different sections that talk about different things and talks about facts in each section
he starts out by telling the concern of space junk then moving on to what space junk is and what its about the author explains the dangers of space junk using examples and things that have actually happened to make the reader believe it i understand the need to be concerned about this space junk because it could cause a lot of problems with the earth astronauts and space crafts
the passage is sorted into four different sections each of the sections emphasize different but equally important topics its begins with an attention grabber and the the body is sorted into three paragraphs each one being supported with a lot of evidence they conclude the paper strongly emphasizing the importance of space junk
he first starts out with the introduction to be interesting to get your attention then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this space junk can be then he talks in order of stuff that goes on in outer space he keeps it simple but also interesting for the readers he explains what goes on that we dont know and that we dont think goes on
the narrator organizes ot by breaking the story off in chapters or seccsions
the author organizes the topics by subheads the subheads break what seems to be long amounts of text into smallermore  manageable and  appealing reading in smaller sections fools the reader into thinking they are not reading as much as they think readers eyes are drawn to the bold text above each topic this form of organization is a useful tool for organizing large amounts of information
the author begins with shocking statements to grab the readers attention then the overall tone of the passage changes to serious when the author presents many statistics and facts the author has a strong conclusion
the author organizes in a good way by using sections the sections help us understand more about the space junk in space one section tells about the space junk and what it exactly is another tells us about some satellites craching into others and making more space junk each section tells us more and more about this arising problem in space
starts out about outter space then gets into the junk up there and the technology
the author sporates it in to many parts and that makes it very organized it being in the parts that it is makes it easy to find stuff if a certain part is asked about not having to read the hole article is nice if you can just read the headings and know where stuff is whats the point of wasting a lot of time reading the whole thing when you just neeed to read the middle section
the author begins the article by relating to the reader in a humorous way once the reader has been hooked in the author begins to describe how big of a problem space junk really is after describing what space junk is the author talks about the dangers of the space junk and how big of a problem its becoming then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger the auhor talks about how space travel is actually the cause and we need to put forth an effort to clean space pollution rather than adding to an already dangerous problem
the space junk title is starting of by saying there is actually space junk in the next paragraph they are saying how the space junk even gets there in the last one they are saying how the space junk can harm space shuttles and all different kinds of things
the author of the article begins by introducing a complex problem in a simple way he or she then provides the reader with background information to put the article into perspective from there the author goes on to thoroughly explains the problem finally the author clarifies the possible effects of the problem and explains its future course
tells us what sppace junk is tells us how dangous it can be if there is junk just floting around and what could happen if there is mircodebris floating around
the author organizes the article by suptitles going from the most improtnant to the least they start off with explaining what the rest of the article was going to be talking about they explained what space junk was and how it was harmful then moved on to how they detect the space junk and how little bits of it is a serious problem
he splits the article up into five sections introduction what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal and a conclusion     in his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines 1and 2 in sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one he does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk then in the conclusion he wraps it up by saying he is sure this problem will continue especially with an increace in commercial space travel
by telling you what the space junk is and then explaining the great things about it and the bad things that can happen as well
talks about how space satellites are leaving space trash
the author organizes the article by first giving a catchy introduction that grabs the attention of the reader then the author defines the problem he is addressing he gives examples and possible causes of the problems then the author gives dangers of the issue the author puts an emphasis on the obstacles of space exploration finally the author reemphasizes the problem and restates the importance of safe space travel he explains what agencies like nasa and the european space agency are doing to prevent damage
the author used a fun and interesting introduction to the article to grab the readers attention after that it turns into a serious matter when the author defines the issue and gives an example of how the issue is created next the author gives great detail as to why it is such a serious matter and why people should be concerned about why it is occuring
the author starts by getting the reader excited then they get let down because the comet isnt a comet its a tool bag the line its a    tool bag directs that      it starts talking about how several civilizations began to send satellites and spacecraft into space and how they eventually dieso the author explains what happens and what can happen to different things that happen to be left in the final frontier
i think that the article is not very organized
he addes head lines to catagorize the info he clumps all the importat face of each paragraph and just addes informaation from each paragraph
in the introduction the author gives a scenario to attract the readers attention where heshe then explains the scenario and its significance in the article thus giving a topic sentence where in the following few paragraphs explains the origination and history of space junk where the narrator then states the harmful effects of space junk and then explains why space junk is so harmful and finally the conclusion states some ways that nasa and other space agencies are trying to solve this problem
first he starts out by getting the readers attention by personal experiance after the readers attention is caught he explains the reasoning for his introduction he then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head after he explains what happens in space with all the different satelites and how dangerous they can be then the last paragraph is there to show how important it is to know about all the space junk in space
the author organizes the article by putting the most important information in first then all the background of the many different things that are placed in space it also shows the dangers of the outter space as well and the many different things to look out for
the author organizes the article into sections that tie into one another and are clear each section ties into the subject the next section will be discussing  the author also usesd comparisons and other facts to retainthe readers interest  the author proves that the issue at hand is important  by leading the reader clearly throught the article to the conclution the author wants
this author organizes this article by first giving an introduction that popped and grabbed the readers attention then goes into more serious matter dating back to when satelites were first built after the author explains that the satelites can crash and once they do that and die they are automatically assumed as space junk then the author explains that even though the satelites and their peices can be little once more and more start dying then outer space can become clutered quickly
the author organizes the article by grabbing the readers attention with each heading
the still of writing and how he grabs our attention with the first sentencs andalso how the auther uses realiist information for the article
the author organizing this article in sections the author starts with an attention grabber the the author goes into more detail about space and satellites
the auther breaks up the article into subtopicssuch as what is space junk and crash course
by stating the main idea and having supporting details

the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is then explaining how it got there and then
the author organizes this story by letting one fact or topic lead to the next topic
they talk about nasa and how there is space garbage up in space theres satellitites that dont even work anymore so they just stay up there in space and everything else that goes into space and then it just stays there

in the article he tells us how leaving junk in space is a threat to us by leaving so much of it in space it makes it difficult to go to the moon for example for we leave too much clutter in space it can also be a threat to us from how fast it is going around the earth how it can damage spacecraft satalites or other stuff that goes into space by telling us this information scientist can someday find a way to get rid of spacejunk so that we can see what space is like to us the author organized it by telling us the history threat and a way to go into space without junk in the way
the author opens the article with a introduction to get the readers attention and then he gives a third paragraph to keep the readers attention and tell them whats coming after this the author seperates the rest of the article into three sections what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal these sections help seperate the articles so the author doesnt have to try to transition from one thought to the next but instead give us information and connect them again at the end of the article in the conclusion

the author organized the article with a persausive informative feel that also has a introduction body and conclusion  the introduction is very attractive  in paragraph one the author began by commanding the reader to do multiple unique things  on top of that the author also asked a rhetoric question in paragraph two with a bit of humor mixed in  the body of this article has a more serious tone by providing facts and history about satellites and how they become space junk  in paragraph four sentance one the author explains how in 1957 the soviet union launched the the first artificial satellite  the conclusion of this article is paragraph 11 where the author clearly restates his point of writing the article  in sentance one and two of paragraph 11 the author proclaims yet the problem is certain to persist in fact the amount of space trash is actually increasing becaus e commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration
the auther organizes the article in sections of different statements and problems
that objects in space can cause harmful reactions to our planet so we must reduce our activity in space why risk something that can hurt the entire planet over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earths atmosphere they explore the vast reaches of our solar system monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless possible has had also major out comes that possibly could harm our planet in the long run

he breaks it up to give a better understanding he gives a good introductions and then gives a topic and under the topic he gives examples and a experience he may of had with lots of details
the author organizes the article by using catchy phrases and useful information to better understand the subject each head title for each paragraph has an intriguing sentence and then the paragraph has supportive details and facts the author mentions nasa and the european space agency and how they take part in the studies of space junk the author does a great job explaining the way that the space junk works in outer space
he starts out with a very attention getting thesis and the he starts at the beging to explain the space junk and what it isthen he tells you what the junk came from and how it got there at the end he tells you jow it can harm you or the earth and how dangerous it can be
the author organizes this article by splitting the topics up he doesnt just put everything together he makes subtitles when he is talking about space junk he labels that section what is space junk but he labels is itallicized because he is trying to make a point
the author organizes the story with easy to navigate subtitles  this method makes it easy to find important information about a certain topic for example if you are curious about the crashing of two satelites you can look under crash course
talks about how soviet union lantched the first satellite and the united states folowed suit and this started the space junk how the rockets fall back to earth and how some of the satellites still orbit the earth and how some have crashed back into the earth
the author organizes the article in a way to explain to you what it is that they are talking about and then tell you why it is so important and why you should be concerned the introduction is an attention grabber so you will want to read the article     in the section subtitled what is space junk the author explains what a satellite is and how they function in the second section crash course the author tells you about the risks of the dead satellites the last section tells you why it is a big deal     the author organizes it in a way to make it easily understandable to the reader
the author categorizes it in such a way that you remain interested and he talks about some of the bigger events that have happened in space he also talks about some of the issues that could happen in the future
i think he is trying to tell us that there is space junk up there and we need to cut back on it cause it can be dificault to manuver a spacecraft throught it when they are lanching off the platform
this person organizes it by having head lines in bold letters this person also starts out by asking a question and then going into what is space junk then it slowly goes into crash courses and how bad it effects our atmosphere
the author organizes the article by seperating all of the topics into four different parts this help to explain different parts of the satellite importances it seperated them from satellites in different countries to seperating them in how they can one day crsh in outter space
the author organizes the article by identifying what exactly it is we are talking about then by saying where it comes from finally the author ends with how it does this in what is space junk the author tells us what space junk is space junk is pieces of debris from various space crafts and such in crash course the author states that these debris come from dead satellites that run into each other finally in little bits but a big deal the auther explains how these debris can be very dangerous these debris when traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to elite spacecrafts
he gose in order one what he knows instead of skiping around
chronological order
this article is organize mostly like an outline it has different sections and after each few parphgraphs it has a new title telling what the paprphraps will be about
he organizes it by starting from when spacecrafts were first being launched and the problems they were causing then to the ones being launched today and the problems theyre causing now
the first three paragraphs get you hooked into the story and make you want to read more  paragraphs four and five give you information about the history of space travel and how and why the space juck is even in space  paragraphs six and seven tell you how dangerous space junk really is  the last four paragraphs let the reader know who is worried about space junk and what people are doing to fix the problem of space junk
the author begins the article with a catchy indtroduction then the author gets more serious and begins to describe space history and the occurence of space junk in outer space the author states hisher claim that space junk is a danger and supports this claim with facts regarding the speed and amount of space junk in space the authors claim is concluded by stating that several space agencies are working to take care of this problem
the author organizes the article by starting with an attention getter than the author gives his thesis statment the author goes on to give background information about the space program  than the aithor stresses the dangers of small free floating particles in space  the author wraps up the article by giving future problems that could occur
the author organizes the article really well in my opinion the author starts off with an interesting introduction that slowly brings you into the rest of the article     after that they get into a sub topic clearloy explaining exactly what is space junk and how it has developed in our orbits they used many facts that really impact the readers knowledge about this space junk     next they talk about how the debris freeorbiting the eart can cause collisions with other debris they use facts and even an instance where the colliosions have appeared     in the final topic they speak about the dangerous and the threats that the debris can cause this passage is very well made with facts comparisons and even an instance of adding more dangerous space junk by loosing a tool bag
the author starts by telling a simple story about a tool bad falling from the sky then the author defines space junk and its threat to earth the it gives some information about two satellites crashing last but not least the author tells us the big pictures such as how the debris can harm spacecrafts and imcreasing amount of space junk
the author starts off by explaining the situation and what has been going on in space which would be the section titled what is space junk  after he explains the situation he moves on to describe how this is a bad thing and how it is happening  then he ends it by talking about how it can affect us
i think the author did a fine job with organizing this article by getting the readers attention in the introduction with dialouge i became interested about what this article would help me learn about after the introduction the author spent his or her time informing the reader about what space junk really is next the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother finally the last paragraphs were to show the reader how important space junk is and how much nasa and other space exploring organizations are concerned with it
the author organizes the article by fact and opinion
the author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration the author puts what is space junk first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere the puts crash course this is letting us know that the space junk is now orbitting around the earth at intense speeds little bits but a big deal this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the earth
the author organizes the article well with the start of a simple introduction the author then starts with individual topics to explian the cause the author begins with explaining space junk then how it effects the crash course then lastly the author explains how little bits can become a big deal
the author organizes the article with different topics realting to space junk the author uses seperation by organizing the article with different subtopics that explain in more detail the dangers in space junk
the author organized the article in a unique way firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment then explaining what he was going to talk about space junk then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes after that how little bits can make a big deal later on finally ending with a conclusion
in the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space in the second section the author tells about how freeorbiting satellites can crash into each other causing small satellites to be formed in the last section of paragraphs the author talks about how big of a danger small freeorbiting satellites can pose and how many countries are trying to find a soloution to the problem
the author organizes this article in a way that first presents the problem then the author goes into further depth about the issue the author first explains where space debris comes from then explains why it is so dangerous the author begins with a fact in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite this makes the reader understand first where the space debris comes from then the author discusses the dangerous effects of space debrisat extreme speeds little bits can pack a punch powerful enough to create disastrous holes in an object moving through space
i think the aurthor organizes the article by putting the actions first and i thaink thats what makes the aruthor have veiwers and grabes the atention   also i think another way was the aurthor put interesting facts in the story that would also atract people to read the aurthors story  
the author first draws the reader in with the introduction then they talk about various forms of space debris after that they discuss what happens when two satellites collide finally they state why space junk is such a problem
the author in organized this article well by starting out with a common retorical allusion explaining what space junk is giving an example and then explaining how its a problem
the author organizes the article into different sections each with a defined purpose the first section is an attention grabber to get the reader interested line 1 grab you telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor the second section is background to give the reader a little knowledge about the topic line 4 in 1957 the soviet union launched th efirst artificial satellite the united states followed suit and thus began the human races great space invasion the third section is whats going on now with the topic line 6 with no one at the controls dead satellites run th erisk o fcollding with each other thats exactly what happened in february 2009 the last section is why the reader should care about the topic line 8 so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash
the auther wanted to write aboutthe danger of debris in space that culd destroy the satilites if not checked
who organizes it over what things are important in space junk and the exploration of space junk
the author organized the article by splitting sections of paragraphs up using different chapter titles this way the article can change topics somewhat freely without looking unprofessional it also helps the author in knowing what to talk about where
this article is organized by facts some are about junkspacecrafts themselvesand even space trash it is very well organized by the paragraphs
the author organizes his thoughts very uniquely in this article  for instance they start out with a shocking statement for a lure  then they move on to a definition and such requires the history of the objects  after such they follow suite with the dangers of microdebris out in space and just how lethal it can become  upon the end of that they switch to how to counteract the problem
he organizes it in different sections to seperate the different topics he does this so that the reader doesnt get confused and it makes it more appealing to the reader
he puts the stuff into a way like a person writing a paper he puts the indtroduction then a couple of paragrahs explaining what it is then he gives a conclusion
by seperating the subject changes with a headlining question
he organizes in diffrent sections describing each section
they first give a brief history of the worlds space exploration in the same paragraph the author tells the reader about what space junk is and how it comes about the author then expands on different subjects under space junk throughout the article
the author organizes it by first explaining what space trash and debris actually is he does this with the heading what is space junk under this heading he talks about how space junk actually occurs as well as a little bit of the history of space travel then he uses the heading crash course to talk about the different crashes between freeorbting satelites in the past then finally he uses the heading little bits but a big deal to try to make the readers understand that even those small tiny bits of trash can seriously harm the functioning satelites and other space craft
the author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line from the intro the author contunues onto define what space junk is to inform the reader what the rest of the paper is about after defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made after making sure the reader know what she is talking about the author goes into the subject of how dangorus these pieces of junk are to astronuts and space travelers in the same paragraph the author also states the the scientifical community is serching for a solution to clean up the debries
the author at the beginning grabs your attention by saying shocking facts next the author jumps right into factual information such as space junk then the author discusses the harmful use of the present time lastly the author talks about the future harms to come to space by talking about countries launching satelites into space which will cause an extreme load of space junk
the author organizes the article into sections with headings the headings give you an idea about what you will learn in the passage below the heading
the author divides it up into a few sections which i think is a pretty good idea because it grabbed my attention
it gives specific detail about the space and it tells you that scientist are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk its giving information about the satelite problems
they organized the articles by telling what the problem was then go over if these things stay in space how they could harm us
by how things happen and when they happen this is how he does it what is space junkcrash courselittle bits but a big dealhe does it that way so you know what the passage is going to be about and what it is going to talk about  he also does it so you know the title of the passage and so you dont have to try to figure out what it is about  another reason he does it so he can orginaze the story into different sections
at first the author grabs the readers attention then the author organizes the article by making each article more important than the last
the author organizes the article first by giving the background information of the start of space exploration they continue on to define satellites and how they are used the second section describes how the satellites played a role in history then the author goes on in the last section to describe how the satellites are a problem now by explaining how they are involved in space pollution
the author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space the first section just explains that there are things in space called space junk the second section explains what  space junk is and how it got there the third section explains that freeorbiting things move quickly and there is a possibility that these things can crash into each other lastly the fourth section the author talks about how even such little things such as pieces of debri are a big deal to people scientists and the earth
the author organizes the article by first talking about orbiting junk then what is space junk then crash course then little bits but a big deal  it just talks about each one indavigally by its self
the author explains what space junk is then explains how it is harmful and last explains how serious this is and that we should help
he organizes it in the years
the author catchs or attention by making a some what funny statement then the author tells us some history behind spae invasion in this section they talk about what happens to the debris that comes close to the earth in the next section they talk about crashes that have happened between satellites from different countries they tell us a little story about how an astronaut lost his tool belt in space they explain to us how even something that little can cause a big problem
the author breaks it down in sections each section talks about diffrent parts of the topic
the author begins with an introduction that grabs the readers attention by making a shocking statement instead of seeing some meteor or comet the author sees a toolbag in space     the author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information in the crash course topic the author states that not just outer space crashes create debris but random small objects too in little bits but a big deal the author elaborates on why we should be concerned one reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them     the author ends with an outro paragragh stating that the problem is increasing but there are people looking for a cheap and easy way to solve the space debris problem
the author organizes this article to get peoples attention to try and let them know that things are dangrous and we dont see it i feel all the author was trying to do is get hisor her point across in a way that would let everyone understand
first the author grabs the readers attention so that they will keep reading the author then explains what space junk is so that the reader will know what the article is talking about the next thing that is talked about is examples of how space junk ended up flying through space like when the astronaut lost his grip on a tool box the last thing he tells the reader what problems the space junk is causing and how people like nasa are trying to solve the problems
the author starts off the article with a simple introduction that will grab the readers attention because of the funny reference the author slowly goes into the importance of the debris floating around in space the next paragraph of the article starts to inform the reader just what is space junk to clear up any other myth about it        the examples of stories and even facts about what exactly is orbiting our earth keeps the articles main purpose flowing their idea was to lead into the true facts that the amount of debris orbiting with the earth is a great amount the last paragraph is meant to leave the reader thinking about what is actually going on in the space above us
he put new headngs on itevery time he would stairt a new secshion
the author organizes the article into multiple sections which each have their own topic to cover the topic of space hazards is too general to cover in one section so many sections are needed to describe all aspects of the idea the writer is hoping to get across
they organize by events that are in differnt sections and they use them in that order
by seadily stating facts and then completely proving hisher point at the end
starts off grabbing your attention and then it gives you facts about space junk then it defines space junk for you and gives you some examples and then gives you the dangers of having space junk
the author is very organized in this article the author starts off the article by catching the readers interest and attention heshe does this by using exclamation and question marks then by titleing the section what is space junk the  author writes about what heshe will be explaining next the author gives examples of what is happening in the world and space by explaining a crash that happened between one american and one russian communication satellite he or she starts off the section by saying in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite lastly the author explains how dangerous space trash and space pollution is heshe also explains yet the problem is certain to persist
he stated out talking about the history of the  satalites and some insteresting facts about them then giving information about an actural accurance in space with two satilites his ideas on how to stop space polution and the dangers and how to prevent it are need to help end the reading
the author organizes the article in four basic tones the first tone is the introduction which is used to grab the readers attention when something interesting and fun with the help of explanation points the second tone is the explaination of the problem this is used to tell the reader the main reason of this article and to explain what space junk is the third tone is a brief history lesson where the author gives real facts of satellites being destroyed by collisons the forth and final tone is the call to action tone where the author brings you into the situation and convinces you to help
he first starts with the general idea then he goes into more ststistics and history last he tells why space junk is a problem
the author organize the article by telling what it is how did it startthe author use date and times he also use how difficult it is out there in space
the way the author organizes the article is quite interesting the author breaks this article into sections making it easyer to read and summerizing each section on the way

the author give you so facts to think about of the topic then gives you history about the topic after that he or she gives you the dangours of the topic and how it effects us
the author begins with an eye catching introduction he then sets a historical background and defines the term space junk to emphasize the seriousness of space junk he relates facts about real crashes that have occured finishing his article with information about the damage space junk can cause the author writes about the paths being taken in order to remedy the situation he finishes with a final warning that space trash is on the rise and companies must collaborate to fix the problem
the author organizes the artical by explaining what space junk is and using statistics from research books internet the author also organizes the story by stating what will happen to space if we keep sending satalites to space and giving decriptions about outer space and nasa the author explaines about how the amount of trash is increasing because of commercial space travel and the military sending satellightes to space
they start with questions and then work in the facts that they have found
the author organizes the article by explaining the most important parts of space history he does this by talking about when the soviet union launched the first artificial satillite he also expains the danger of space exploration tiny fragments traveling at a high speed could cause major damage to the earth
the author uses shocking statements to hook the reader so he can get interested in the article then he explains what space junk is while giving you some history about space exploration next he explains how and why satellites can crash into each other last he states that tiny space trash is dangerous and states that the amount of space trash is increasing
the author organizes the article by makeing chapter like sections about different details in crash course the author is talking about the dangers of satellites colliding with each other in another he talks about what space junk is
they start off by useing serioud fscts about the garbage in our atmosphere that is flying around in out of control msnner
she starts out by gathering your attention about a coment so your like mhmmm sounds like a good article so then she goes on about space junk in 1952 founded by thesoviet union then it goes on about over time it closes
the author organizes the article by sectioning it off into groups so we can understand the material the author starts off lighthearted and keeps getting more serious what is space junk helps us understand the overall idea and explains the material in the article then the sections following that get more in depth and portray the seriousness of orbiting junk
the author organizes th article by first telling you what they are talking about  next they talk about what can happen to space junk  then finally they talk about the problem they pose on the surface and the astronauts in space
the author organizes this article by starting it off with a kind of comical start trying to appeal to the readers then he goes into the past giving the reader a sense of history next he still stays in the recent pass and gives us a thought about what happened and why that this happened then the author focuses in on the main topic and why all of this is such a big deal
i dont know
the author first talks about what is the earths autmosphere can handle and what we may see out there  they then go on to what space junk actually is and how we have been doing it for the past fifty two years  the crash course talks about how the little bits of debris can cause such a disaster in space and on earth they end the article by describing how the bits of fragments can cause the earth and satilites big problems
the author starts out the article with intresting statements to grab the readers attention as the article progresses the author explains exactly what he is talking about and then gives the dangers and concerns about space junk and the effects it has on satellites
the author organized this artical by starting off with information about when the soviet union and when thay launched their first satellite and then started talking about space junk and how satellite were crashing into each other
the author oraganize the article by telling the importante part first and giving detials about the main part in the story
they organize it by importance and in order of how it will affect us for example how they talk about what it is then stating how it happens and then what the space junk actually is
the way this statement is organized is very well because they start off by getting your attention next they start with some basic information that will help you understand what is coming up then after they hit the hard facts that you should know about space junk like how even the smallest things in space can affect a big space ship with this happening also that we could have satellites crashing into each other and the tiny parts flying into earth so this article is very organized
i dont really know but i know he is talking about space
the author organizes the article by making sections of the article to have the reader become interested by the title and have them continue to read they will learn about the dangers of space junk and what can happen to it
starts with the beginning of it all and then goes through it all tell what we know now it says in the beginning of what is space junk in 1957 and in the end it says in 2008
the author organizes the article by starting at the history of space explorations the author wants the reader to have a good background of how many different satellites have been put into space orbit the author then describes in great detail what exactly space junk is and what is made up of the author wants the reader to comprehend the amount of space junk in space the author then describes why there is space junk he tells about what is causing space junk and why the author describes that large things going extremely fast in orbit can cause tiny micro pieces being sent into space then the author tells the reaeder why they should care about space junk the author gives us different ways the space junk is harmful to space ships astronaunts and other satellites then he or she says what different space companys are doing about the space junk and how they are trying to prevent it
the author organizes this article into diffrent sections throughout these sections he goes over diffrent topics about the space junk he still stays on the same topic and convinces the reader that this is a serious matter while revealing diffrent sections that all tie together
instead of putting all the topics into one big article the author breaks it down into sections this keeps the article more organized and makes it small articles put into a bigger article all the topics are related to one another
he organizes the article in a way that describes the cause of one thing to the next and explains each section in detail
he uses the more serious information as he goes so the more you read the more interesting and more serious it gets he also puts older facts before the more recent ones like he says in paragraph 4 in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite then in the sixth patagrath he talks about something that happened in 2009
the author organizes the article by first giving a brief introduction on space junk then they give a little bit of background information on space junk next the author gives examples of when space junk was actually harmful finally they explain how its harmful and how it could potentially be a bigger problem
the way the author organizes this article is that he uses a very eye cathing thesis or opening statements for example  grab your telescope look up at the sky its a comet its a meteor then he puts a subtitle on the next subjects he brings up to keep it very organized example what is space junk crash course and then the last subtitle is little bits but a big deal each subtitle leads into one another very nicely and does not get uyou confused
the author first starts with a shocking quote then goes on to explain about this epedimic after the author explains that we should try to fix this
the author organizes the article by starting with a introduction to grab the readers attention then background information on space exploration and what space junk really is the article then highlights different events where space junk has caused a problem or an accident has occured that created new debris in space the author then has a paragraph explaining how harmful space junk can be and how it can or cannot be detected the article finishes with a conclusion that outlines space pollution and the issues that can arise because of it
the author starts with stating the serious yet shocking facts of the article then the article has seperate subtopics which state important details relating to the subtopic for example the subtopic crash course tells the danger of satellites colliding together
the author uses a hook to get the reader interested  then they tell about what space junk actually is for people who dont know  they also tell how that space junk is created  finally in the section titled little bits but a big deal they emphasize that even though most space junk is only tiny peices it is a serious problem and can cause a lot of issues
he organized them according to how serious the issue is they are all a big problem but some more then others like the satellites are all going to crash eventually is a scary thing to think about space debris is not always small there are some debris out there that would blow up a bigger satellite plus the astronauts have to go up there and fix things that get broke by the debris
the author organizes this article by first grabbing the readers attention and then explaining the history of space travel and space junk  through the sixth paragraph the author talks about why space junk is dangerous and how it effects us today  the author also brings up the tool bag inncident  most people wouldnt think it was a big deal if a tool bag was let loose in space but the author organized this article to explain why it is such a big deal after describing what space junk is and to warn everyone of the dangers of space junk
by telling how space junk is when its in space and factors about it to
the author brakes down the article into sections  the sections he broke them into is what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal
the author begins the article with an attention getting introduction followed by historicle statistics finally including that satellites are in great risk of colliding with eachother and emphasizing the great danger of such small particles in space
he has it very organized it goes in sections on how he wants it to be written
they orginized it by throwing in history facts in the begging and then talking about the problems that occur in space with  theses satilites and then they talk about how we can prevent all of these things that happen
the author organizes the article  by telling u what something is and tells u how it got there
he organizes it from what is space junk to how it is harfuml on what it could do or effect something ot another
the author organizes the article by different topics the first topic he talks about is what is space junk he talks about the different types of space junk in the section the second topic he has listed is crash course in this section he talks about what happened in february of 2009 when two communication satellites crashed into each other the third and final section in about little pieces but a big deal in the he talks about how little pieces of matter are a big deal in the atmosphere these little pieces flying around this fast can destroy a satellite
the first paragraph is a very good attention getter it makes it clear to grab your attention then it follows into telling the readers a breif history passage about spacecraft it also later goes into telling the risks of satellites controlling eachother lastely it talks about how loosing space trash is serious matter
the aurthor devided their artical into sections the first is to catch the reader attention the second to tell us what they are talking about and give us a breif history in the forth and fith section she made it clear how important it was to try and reduce the amount of space junk
the author organizes this article using passages for different information what is space junks crash course and little bits but a big deal are all seperate passages that talk about different things
the author starts his article with an attention grabber and briefly mentions space junk in the next article the author by giving a short history of space flight like the how the soviet union  launched the first satellite next he describes how these space projects have caused problems and what they are sugesting to do
the author organizes the article kind of like a comic book at the beginning the rest of the article is like a big story of information
the author organizes the article in a simple and orderly fashion heshe explains the problem and tells how it happened
he starts with an attention grabing introduction he follows up with a section called what is space junk to get the reader involved and to provide factual information he then added the section crash course to provide information on satellite crashes he ends with the section little bits but a big deal to inform the reader of the dangers of space debris
the author organizes this article by breaking it up into four parts the firt part or the introduction gives us a small anecdote on what possibly could happen the next three parts give us details on the three main points of this article what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author starts with a shocking hook which draws the reader in then in what is space junk they give some basics as to how space junk has come to be in crash course the author elaborates on space junk including a specific example in little bits but a big deal the author goes into detail about what the effects of space junk can be and how they can cause a difficult situation      in paragraph 11 they author concludes by stating that space junk is increasing and that a solution needs to be found
the author organizes this article by putting the least important first and the most important topic last the author first started talking about space junk then moved on to satellites and how they can collide into other satellites the last thing the author talked about was how many people care about all of the trash that is in space
the author starts off with an attention grabber allowing the audience to get hooked and read more then he talks about the facts of how many satellites and telescopes have been sent into space informing the audience what he is getting at then the author talks about how in space its really not that safe he describes how satellites have a risk of colliding since there is no one controlling them finally he talks about how serious matters can be and ow they monitor the satellites and maintain catalogues of known subjects to wrap it all up he mentions that the space agencies hope that everyone works together to come up with a solution to space pollution
the author starts off by grabbing your attention with the introdution then informing you what space junk is he then talks about the damage that space junk can do and finally tells what scientists are trying to do about it
the author organized this article good the reason i say that is because he has told you how important it is that trash is not sent to outer space
the author organizes the article by giving the history of people going to space and causing this space junk first then the author authoritizes the risk of what could happen if we keep making space junk after that the author talks about how we are trying to fix this problem and how we could fix it
it lets you know what the paragraphs are going to be a bought it lets you know what space junk is first as it goes deeper into the article it gets more serious it finally conclues with  a startling fact
first he starts off with a personal comment then he defines what is actual space junk and how it got started then he states how we first started adding space junk and how its affecting people that are working in outter space
the author starts by telling about the sky then they tell you about space junk what it is and how it got there the author tells you everything from the beggining to the end

i think this author organizes this article by using supportive details and information he got and comparing them together and providing the information he found out to other people
the author starts off by explaining the history of space travel in the what is space junk section this way people who are unaware of the history will have a greater sense of how everything started then the author moves onto the next section which has examples of how space junk is actually created giving prime examples and actual events can make the problem more believable to the reader the last session is all about why someone should care that space is being polluted this article is organized by givimg you a how a when and a why
the author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal  the author captures the readers interist through the introduction by using a shocking statement and making readers think why is there a tool bag in the sky  after this the author describes the history of space travel and the space race as well as describing what happens to technology that is broken and just floating around in space in the section what is space junk  then in the section crash course the author describes how satellites and debris collide and the effects of the collision  after this point the author describes the horrible impacts of small microdebris on other space ships and satellites and what engineers and scientists are doing to counteract this in the section little bits but a big deal  finally the author concludes that the problem is certain to persist and that the amout of space trash keeps increasing and then the author ends the article by saying that space agencies hope that corporations can come together to find a solution to the problem of space junk
he orgganizes it by factes that he has of the space junk
i think he put them in order by the first discovery and then in the order of more discoverys as time went along
the author organizes his article in many ways one of these ways is by having a great introduction by having a great introduction the author is able to grab our attention in an instant and keep us reading      another way is that the author describes to us what space junk is exactly they did this so we are able to get more background information on the article so we are able to understand it better

idk this one either
the author organizes this article by using headings based on the information in the paragraphs below them for example under the heading titled what is space junk there are examples of what space junk is and how it gets there under the heading crash course there are examples of how objects in space without control run the risk of colliding and causing a lot of damage to both objects and creating more space junk the author then closes the article with a good conclusion

the article contains topics what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal to organizee the article
from year to year that people went into space
the author organizes the article according to topic for example in subsection what is space junk the author explains exactly what is space junk in the other two subsections they are once again organized by topic crash course talks about crashes of space junk and little bits but a big deal talks about microdebris
the author does a good job of stating proof after his statements everything he says is backed up by proof he explains to the reader what space junk is the how it happens and even gives examples of space junk in the world today

first the author states an interesting fact about space junk and then explains that it is a concern for astronauts the author explains what space junk is and how it got up into space then explains what impact the space junk could have on space stations and other technology up there lastly the author expresses that even the smallest things up in space can pose a threat to manmade technology up in space no matter how small the junk may be it can still cause damage
he gets your a
he tells you what the article is about then he tells you about the main topic then he tells you how space junk is a problem lastly he tells you how small things can become a big problem
the author organizes the article like this because he wants to explain what space junk isthen how it got there and what happens when it breaks up in space what is the causes of it in space how we can take care of it
the author organizes his article by putting a title over each section he does this first by talking about the orbiting junk and then by what is space junk and so on and so fourth
first the author seperates the article into sections by using section headers  this tecnique is usually the best for dividing up article information  the author then uses a persuasive attentiongetter to grab the readers attention in the beginning then goes off to tell what it is and where it came from  basically it is a well organized informative essay  you can tell that it is informative by the way it uses facts and true details to explain the situation
the author organizes it by obseving what is happening in space and that things in space travel very fast and are very dangerous every once in a while some of the debris will get scattered around and will cause harm to the enviroment plus the soviet union was the first to launch an artificail sattelite and the united states followed shortly after
the author gose in order with what relly happens
the author organize this article be seperating each kind of problem by putting them in their own category also he discussed different type of space problems
the author organizes the passage by an introduction into some of the common things that can be found in orbit around the planet then the author tells us about the history of countires sending artificial satellites starting with telling us about when the first one was launched     next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide in the febuary of 2009 two satelites one american and one russian bith collided with eachother both of the satellites where considered disabled and wouldve been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces now they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision     finally the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something in space even tiny particles will cause some major damage the author refers to a gentle breeze blowing sand to using a sand blaster to remove paint off of a concrete wall to give us an accurate picture of what can happen

the author uses subtitles to organize the article  before certain paragraphs at the lefthand side is a bolded subtitle  for example before the author gets into defining space junk there is a subtitle labeled what is space junk  also before the author tells about the microdebris in space there is a title labeled little bits but a big deal
the author organizes his article by puting them in date order he also tells us about how the space jumk is and like how it causes pollution to the plantent
the author first makes you aware of what orbits in space then he or she illustrates what could happen to all of that debris in the final paragraph the author shows that even though the debris is small it is still really dangerous and closes with a paragraph talking about how space pollution is a persisting issue
the author puts it in order from the events are happeningfirst it starts with different information about it and what is going on secondly it tells you the risk and chances of satellites colliding with each other thirdly they let you know that small problems are happening but it is a big deal last it explains that problems are still existing and the amount of space crash is increasing
first the author uses a clever anecdote to catch the readers attention then he defines the problem that he will disucss in the article next he gives the reader background information on the subject of space junk after that he gives an example of how past problems with satellites finally he states the continuing issue that must be avoided and what is being done to solve it
he organizes it by describing what space junk is and how it can turn into a big deal for astronauts out in space
the author organized the article by trying to catch the readers attention first once they had done that they would organize all of their information based on categories of relevance starting off by explaining what exactly they were talking about in this case it was space junk and they defined it under a specific title explaining what it was from there out they used the same sort of technique talking about how collisions are usually caused how powerful the impacts of the microdebris could be and gave each portion very clear titles that made it all easy to locate what you were looking for
the author is trying to give simple data to learn more about space junk
the author first gets the attention of the reader then the author informs the reader what space junk is and the way it got there the author then explains how the amount of space junk has grown from two satellites crashing and a tool bag being lost by an astronaut within the past three years the author then finishes the article by explaining how even the smallest bits of space junk can cause serious damage and how he hopes that nations can work together to solve this issue

the author organizes the article in a scructure that assists in  explaining the situation and convincing the reader of the possible dangers that space junk poses the author begins with statements that grap the readers attention and introduce the topic being addressed  next the author begins the section called what is space junk and he describes the history behind space exploration and how the idea of space junk has become a serious problem today  then the author provides the reader with a specific example of how harmful and serious space junk can be  the author finishes by explaining how difficult the situation is and how both nasa and the european space agency are both working on finding ways to avoid prevent and get rid of space junk
he orginized the artical by using subheadings and sectioning the information out
the author did a very nice job on organazation  they had an interesting introduction  they also didnt take anytime though to get right to the point  they explained the serious matter in little sections to focus on certain parts  there were different issues for different sections  they were very informative  i think they backed up their informantion well with supporting details  facts

he organizes it by giving some information then he gives some history about space exploration he then tells about the terms and other minor things involved with space junk
the author does a great job in organizing this article he organizes it so all his information leads to his point of the article he explains what is going on is space by first giving some history of the problem then he gets to the main point of the problem and explains how dentremental it really is to space and the environment
the author oraganizes this article by explaining what space junk is then telling how it occurs and then going on to say how it affects the the atmosphere in outer space and astronauts examples of this are one the first paragraphs after the introduction are about what space junk is the second paragraph is about how space junk happens and the final paragraph is about how space junk affects the atmosphere and astrnauts
the author organizes this article with an intresting introduction and later states different sections that include diffrent information for those topics
at first it begins to explain what space is like now with all the cluttered junk and what it was decades ago in paragraph five it slowly begins to tell you how serious the junk is in our atmosphere and how harmful it is to our planet earth in paragraph eight it asks so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash the next paragraph explains who does and why
the author begins the article orbiting junk with a comment on something seen in space they ask what it is and they find that it is a tool bag which seems absurd since it is in space the author then moves on to describe exactly what is space junk he includes a little history regarding space operations as well as their purpose and the negative outcome they can have the autho then goes on to state the dangers of dead satellites in space as they can crash into each other he uses two example the first one is the crash of a russian and american satellite crashing into each other creating debris left in space the second one being the tool bag which escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs the authors conclusion highlights the dangers of the debris in space and what they can do he aslso includes that the problem is getting worse but agencies hope to work together to reduce space pollution
the author gives us details about the space
the author of this article organizes his detail in a introduction three pharagraphs on his main points and a conclusion the introduction being attention to the atricle and makes you wonder about space junk the next three main points are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal all three of these paragraphs are explaining what the author is trying to write about in this aticle the last point of the atricle the conclusion is to make you wonder about and make you want to do something about space junk and what is going on and how we can do something to make it go away

the author organizes tthe article in a tragic to not
the author organized the article in an explaining order  first the author grabs the readers attention by talking about a tool bag in the sky  the in the section what is space junk the author expalins what the junk is that is orbiting  as the author moves into crash course the author talks about a true incident that happened in february 2009  in the ending section the author uses little bits but a big deal to sum up that the space junk may be small but it is a big deal and serious
the author organizes the article by introducing what is space in the junk the author gives us specific information about the satellites then the author beggins to tell us it problems and ho wdoes it affects us
the author of orbiting junk is explaining that there is junk in space that can come doen to earth that can made more damage that can have more damage but with more smaller junk cant be seen
they show the facts first and tell you what could happen

the author organizes the article ina very logical way they start out with a kind of story to grab the readers attention and when their attention is directed to that certain point the author starts to explain it the author startes with how people began getting into space and how space junk ends up in orbit and ends that section by telling how satelites that malfunctions or breaks goes on an uncontrolled orbit the next section explains the results when two such uncontrolled satelites collide explaining that they create millions of tiny pieces of space junk they end the article then explaining why the pieces of space jusnk which are so small actually make a difference
the author organizes this article by telling how space junk and  space exploration is harmful it also goes in order from the smallest to the biggest problems that need to be taken care of
the other organizes it by telling you what it is then it tells you how they become uncontrolled orbits and can have risks of colliding with eachother which can be very harmful to us becasue they go at really fast speeds then it explains how they try to control that but they cant do much but watch them
the author organizes the article with mind grabbing statements then explaining what space junk is how it is created how it can crash and what impact it makes
the author organizes the article by telling the information to the reader in order and is not all scrambled up the author talks about space junk and what it is he tells us what it does and how it acts in space then he talks about its crash course and about how the little pieces of rock can cause serious damage to the spacecraft
the author organizes it by telling you what space junk is and then he goes back and says whay it does to effect us people do not realize what harm it could have
to begin the author grabs the readers attention with an interesting introduction heshe then adresses the problem about space junk in the next section the author explains what exactly space junk is and gives some background information on it the next section explains the dangers of the floating dead satellites and gives an example in 2008 a tool bag escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repais on the internationaal space station in the last section heshe describes what scientists are trying to do to solve the persistent and increasing problem that is space junk
the author talks about how bad space junk is he gives souportive detaels about why its bad
the autor organizes the article by making different headlines for different topics they set out certain bullet points that they want to talk about and then once theyve mentioned the problem in the headline then they go into more detail about it they have three different things that they talk about specificaly one being what is space junk the second being crash course and the third being litlle bits but a big deal the autor makes this an easy read becasue you dont have to read the whole thing to find what youre loooking for because they broke it up into diferent topics and into different paragrapghs
the author organize the article because you should grab your telescope and look up the sky to see a planet that the satellite would crash another satellite to cause a space pollution try to protect the outer space
the author organized the article in a sequence of events ranging from how the satellites got into space to how they crash and then tells the reader of the broken satellites severity to other space crafts in orbit  the author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next
the author at first gives you some background information on the space race between russia and the united stateshe then talks about how the satellites that were launched need repaired or sometimes crash into each other which is a cause of the space junk the author then ends the article by telling us the danger and damage this little fragments can cause
the author organizes by descibing space junk the how space junk can collide with other space junk thus explaining how the collisions leave debris and cause a problem
the author organizes the article into different sections to emphasize specific details about a topic and give detailed information about individual topics

the author of orbiting junk organizes the article with subtitles subtitles allow the reader to sort of know what the next few paragraphs will be about and make it easier to find certain information throughout the article
the auther organizes the articles by titles about what he wants to talk about like in the article  what is space junk he she talks about space junk and how it effects our admisphere and the rocketships in space      in the article crash course heshe talks about how two satellites crsh into one anouther and how it effects the atmosphere and how it will cause truble in the fouter for spaceships
he starts with the first satellite being launched and how much space has changed since then
the author organizes the article by giving the readers background information about the crashes in the past then it gives us information from the debris from the crashes between the satellites
first the author gives an interesting statement that grabs the readers attention then they explain what the space junk is they explain how space junk can become disabled objects and can circle the goble uncontrollably next they tell how these disabled objects can create crashes that disassemble the ojects into tiny fragments finally they state that the problem will continue and the space trash will increase causing harm that needs a solution
the author starts with a introduction then the author describes what space junk is next the author talks about how space junk can be created finally the author talks about how important it is that we try to solve the space junk problem
he organize by history firstthen tell about the course they takethen its about trash in spacelast it give you information about space pollution
the author organizes the article in how the outer space is and what is going wrong with it
the way they organize this article is by explaning what space junk is to inform the readerthen they explain the effect it has and why its a problem to our space programthen at last they give deatils about how it dangours and why we should do something about this problem
the author organizes the article by different concerns for example the first section what is space junk describes what space junk is and how it negatively affects the environment the second section crash course describes how the colliding of satellites affects the amount of microsatellites flying through space which proposes a huge problem for astronauts trying to maneuver around them the last section little bits but a big deal describes that while the space debris may be very small they can pose a lot of damage on other spacecrafts which could ultimately jeopardize the safety of astronauts
he organizes it by first trying to get peoples attention with the type of sentences he uses in the begining then gets serious by trying to convince how important this actually is to him and the enviornment then continues that same importance throughout the article
he starts out with a senario where someone sees a tool bag in space  then he goes on to list statistics and facts about space exploration  along with this he gives some startling facts such as satellites crashed while going 20000 miles per hour  finally he rapped it up with a conclusion that this is a growing issue and has to be solved
the author organizes this article by dividing it up into topics in order to capture the readers attention  the author starts by drawing in the readers imagination and then informs him or her that this is a serious issue  right after the introduction the author knows he or she has the readers attention and starts informing them of space junk  before all the information can bore the reader the author changes the topic to crash course this causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space the author finishes off by telling the reader that this is a serious issue but keeps the mood light by saying there is a tool bag loose in space  this keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information
the author organize the article by brecking it down into peices by using the names orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal by using this like that it makes the reader wanna read this stuff so ya it makes it istering
the author organizes the article by grabbing the readers attention at the begining paragraph using startling statistics after the author has got the readers attention they take the rest of the article into serious matter to explain the dangers of space junk
he organizes it in subarticles such as crash course
the author organizies his work by the smallest problem to the biggest problem for example in orbiting junk it is explaining the facts about space junk in what is space junk its telling you about space junk in crash course it is explaining about the colliding of the two satelites with each other then in the last section little bits but a big deal it is showing how that is a serious problem to the other satellites in the air
he goes from present tense to past tense to provide an example then goes to future tense to say what could hapen if space junk gets worse
the author first has an attention grabber to get the interest of the reader the author then states a fact and states reason for the fact then the author explains about satellite crashes and freeorbiting satellites the author then puts in the question so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash to get the author to think then the author ends the article by restating the problem and stating a fact about how people are trying to solve it
it organize the article telling the readers what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal its letting readers know whats going on in outterspace most people believe that outterspace may not be as dangerous but the narrator is trying to persuade the readers outterspace is more dangerous than being on earth
the author organizes the article in a simple yet structured way fortunately for a topic such as this the author seperates main ideas into their own sections such as crash course and little bits big problem this type of article is easy for anyone to read and especially easy to find the information you are looking for in a quicker way opposed to perhaps looking it up in an encyclopedia
the author organizes the article by explaining what space junk is and what it can do to earth and surrounding satellites then the autho goes on to explain about why space junk is going to increase
he puts it in groups or in indevidual sections like what is space junk
it gives me brief information about the article  startng the article off with some hurmor grab your telescope  look up in the sky  its a comet  its a meteor  its a tool bag     then goes into the begining about how the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite  the united states followed suit and thus began the human races great space invasion  it goes on about what happens when tools float off into space by itself and how it could be really dangerous       the conclusion just states that hopefully in the future scientist can come up with a solution about how to solve the space pollution problem
the author uses subtitles to tell the readers what the following infermation will be about the author has a funny or interesting subtitle for each section of information he uses these subtitles to orginize his article under the subtitle crash course the author tells about a collision that happend these subtitles give the readers something to think about before the read that specific section of the article the author uses subtiles to help orginize the information in the article

the auther organize the artical by putting a title for each parograph with all the right information to make it easyer for the readed to understand also the parograph is orgainized by the dates and what happend
the author organizes it in a proper manner it was mostley in order and never of the topic or the paragraph
he give goods examples and then he uses alot of facts to back up what he was talking about he also uses alot of information about past accendets that happend in space cause of debris
the author organizes this article in a very intelligent way  first he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction  then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs  the first one is called what is space junk this paragraph defines space junk and explains how it is formed the next paragraph is called crash course  this paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous  the last paragraph is title little bits but a big deal  in this paragraph the author is explaining that even though most of space junk is relativley small it can still be dangerous at high speeds
the author first captures the reader with the introduction by using related terms after the introduction the author gives background facts about space junk in the past the author also describes the seriousness of space junk and debris in the following paragraphs at the resolution the author describes how space agencies must come together and fix this serious issue and shows that space junk is a continuous problem
the author separates his different information into groups by content  in the block under crash course there is related information about space satellite crashes which create space junk  he separated all his convincing information into three different blocks of information to keep make it easier to understand and stay on track
it does not expalain way they did it in the first place but what they did must of be good for the space program
the author organizes the article by catching the readers attention then informing them what space junk is the next section titled crash corse explains how space debris is made and it lists specific examples such as the american and russian satellites crashing into eachother in 2009 in the last section the author explains why space debris are harmful and what is being done to help solve the problem
the author organizes the article in a opening support conclussion format this meaning that the first section titled what is space junk is clearly going to talk about what space junk is which will create a nice segway to talk about little bits but a big deal
the author emphasizes that space junk is harmful to the space atmosphere and if we didnt put more junk up therein space it would be much better

the author organizes the article with titles the name of the title gives the reader an idea of what the passages will be about what is space junk gives the reader an idea of the junk thats in space
he first explains the history of space exploration such as the space race between the soviet union and the united states then he goes on to describe how much of the space junk comes from and how it can be dangerous to the spacecraft and satellites that continue to move around our atmosphere
he does it with an introductiontwosupporting paragraphsand a conclusion
he organizes it by first getting your attention with cool facts he then moves on to the history about space satellites before moving on to the incidents that occur with these space junk peices from there he moves on to the facts about space junk then finaly he go ons about trying to find a way to get rid of or protect from the space junk
having four sections in the article all talking about interesting facts from past experiences or problems with atmospheric conditions helps the reader stay interested
its saying that orbiting junk is something that matters to you you have to do somthing about it space junk is soviet union  launched the frist artifical satellite over they years  variety of spacecraft that may things can come to the world in no timeproblems is a certain to  persist in the amout of what they are talkina about is diffcult to handle by there self with anyone problems we have ma have may problems in the world but this one is most difently a tru one

the author states what space junk is then how the space junks occurs lastly finishes off with how much effect the space junk can cause  the author says that many things have been shifted off beyonds earths atmosphere then the author says that when satellites become useless they become dead and will crash with another dead satillite which will cause some mess the auther also says that the little mess can cause some much damage for beinging so small
he organizes it by diffrenet tips of things that happen in space or about the spacecraft
the author seperates each topic and it all appears very organized even when you read it it all flows together and works good as an article also the author keeps the information seperated and doesnt repeat the same things over and over again
he organizes things in a chronological order crash course explains what happens when two orbiting bodies collide with one another little bits but a big deal explains what happens after a collision has taken place
the author shows how we got to this problem of space debris they seperate each paragraph using bold faced words that flow into eachother the author also uses factual information to show this problem we have in space
the auther put the artical in chronological order  in the introduction the auther is getting ready in the second section the auther discribes how the dibry comes about  in the third section it is discribed at to what usually happens to the debre whenit is in the free flow orbit this continues to what the posibilities are to going out into space and what the dangers are

the author organizes the article by giving each subject he is talking about a sub heading and staying on topic he also uses lots of statistics and supports them all
the author organizes this article by like ideas the introduction has a clever beginning to draw readers in and then the rest becomes more serious the second section what is space junk defines the subject to the reader so that they fully understand the article the third section crash course shows the magnitude of the space junk with a specific instance on how it came to be the forth and final section summarizes all the previous sections and makes the point that space junk orbiting the earth really is a dangerous issue overall the author organizes the article in an easy to comprehend bitsized manner
he puts it in very understandable terms instead of making it complicated and what not he made it so that the last paragraph can sort of link on to the other one
it starts off with a attention getter to grab the readers attention the author than creates a short passage providing information on what is being meant to talk about in the passage the first thing he does is provides information about what space junk is and a little information about the history behind it the author explains that space junk is what the soviet
in to two driffent sections so he can better expalne what he is talkieng about
the author organize the article by tellin how the space junk can be harmful the author is telling how the satellites crashed into each other and how the tool bag fell out the man hand
the arthur organized the articale by
they start off by grabbing the readers attention by using exclamation points and then go into the history of space junks they tell the reader that it is a serious matter

he stars with an interdoction to get you intersetes in space so look at the sky then he lets you know how much space junk is in space like satellites then it tells you how satellites crash in space then how people need to learn about the junk that can damage the spacecraft in space while traveling
the author first states the problem then he expalins what the problem is by breaking it down into three parts thats why he he has a section called what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author organizes the article by starting out w a famous pop culture reference that catches your attention then they get to the serious stuff in the introduction explaining the timeline and statistics of space travel so that the reader gets the idea of what he or she is reading about following the introduction is the body of the article that explains the main idea further then comes the conclusion that gives the authors opinion on the topic of the space junk crisis
the author is trying to tell us that space junk is very bad and can do harm to us humans and the evironment it also can cause problems to the astronauts in outer space
he starts out with something that grabs the readers attention and then goes into some statistics with telling people how some microdebris can be very dangerous to telling about the american and russian crashing into each other at speeds faster than 20000 miles per hour the authors tells a lot of information and gives some statistics about space travel

the author starts with and introduction then a description followed by an incident and ends with a reason for the incident the introduction grabs the readers attention then the desctiption sets up the article for a conflict and a reason for the conflict to have occured
the author starts out trying to get your attention with what may in the sky then the author begins telling about space junk and how the government have great concern about space junk they talk about the variety of spacecrafts space capsules telescopes and satellites that have been sent out beyond earths atmospherethey also talk about how many satellites end up crashing into eachotheralso how little paticles or space junk moves 5 miles per second
he orginizes by the level he thinks is important he wants to get a point across that it is a big deal if satellites crash because they can break down into many little parts and soon come onto earths surface if it comes on earths surface it can harm peoples health
the author uses intresting staements at the beginning to grab the readers attention this is shown because of the statment of the tool bag then the author tells about space junk and history it gives information about space junk and why it occurs lastly the article tells of the importance of the junk the author tells intresting facts that proves it is serious
he puts the main facts first then makes the other important facts follow after
the author first tells you about orbiting junk around space then the author proceeds to tell you what space junk is the author then tells you about what can happen to sattelites and space junk colliding the author also tells you how the little peices of debris is a big deal
the author organized this article like a magazine organizes its articles
the author organizes the article by sections each section going into more detail about different space junk topics  the first section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk is the next section titled crash course explains the affects of having freeorbiting disabled satellites flying through space the last section of the article little bits but a big deal goes into detail about how microdebris lays a big impact on spacecrafts
he thinks there is a problem with junk invloved with space craft and there is a such thing as junk and trash in the space
the author organizes the article so that it is easy to follow and understandable  someone who doesnt know anything about space exploration can easily know what the author is talking about and what message the author is addressing because of the organization       the author first draws the reader in with the introduction and addresses the problem  he then explains what space junk is  the next section explains how space junk occurs and the article concludes with how big of a problem the small bits of microdebris can cause
he put different sections in it and caught the readers attention in the begining
according to the article the author organizes the article by putting catchy phrases to attract the reader to read into more of the passage then after a catchy introduction the author talks about what space junk is and how it is harmful to our satellites and how the debris affects earth
it started off with one thing then went to the next it told us how bad space junk was this was when the soviet first put a satellite in space the crash course told about the satellite the satellite ran the risk of colliding into each other the little bits but a big deal told us what was important and what was not it showed us the serious problem told us about the tiny fragments traveling thre space
the author organizes the article by putting it in headings  he has headings such as what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author organizes the article into three sections following the introduction these are titled what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal these sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read
he has a new tittle for everything he is about to talk about
the author organizes the article with a hook that interest the reader with bold statements states the main point with background information on satellites history and strong conclusion warning the reader about the dangers of the increasing amount of space junk and suggests a solution to the problem
well first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what space junk is he then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk lastly he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that nasa is looking for a solution
the auther tells us how important the space stuff is used
the author organizes this article in a text book form  with sections having titles what is sapce junk and then having information under the section titles it has facts backing up theyre statements
the article is organized in a chronological way the lifespan of debris so to say the author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit and will soon enough crash into one another this creates hundreds of microsatellites otherwise known as debris these debris are flying over 20000 miles per hour and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with its path of travel the author then concludes with a sort of look to the future with commercial space programs which will only worsen the space pollution issue
first the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations second we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them the authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they die and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the iss finally we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous           if you find that hard to believe compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wallthis gives us an example of something on earth to compare to the debris in space
the author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention by then identifying the flying object in the sky as atool bag it makes the reader want to read the article the author goes on by explaining what the meaning of space junk is and how it gets there followed by what happen to satellites when they die the author finishes hisher article by notifying the reader that space junk is a big deal and is increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations  have undertaken  space exploration
the author organizes the article by using bold headings to catch readers attention
the author first catches your attention with the introduction the author then explains how space junk is formed and next why it poses a problem in space the last passage explains the seriousness of the space junk in order to drive the point home
the author organizes this article by importance first he grabs the attention of the reader and then leads into background detail about space junk the author then provides a paragraph that explains the dangers of satellites lastly the author ties it all up and explains that there are many people who care about a serious problem
there are many bold faces titles in the artical to show which each one is about
he put it in year order he put a title above each section
after the introduction the author starts by describing what this space junk is by talking from when the first satellite was launched to the supposedly hundreds of little junk satellites scattered around orbit crash course explains a story about a crash in space that left debris in space and that these accidents can happen at any time in space the last part talks about how this debris is dangerous despite its size
the author oraganizes this artices very well he starts out by telling us what space junk really is and how it worksnext he would tell us about microsatellites and how they are used at last he talked about tiny bits of space trash so over all he did really well oragnizing this article
the article is organized in a flowing manner it starts by giving a point goes through the body by describing what the narrator means by it and ends in a call to action
the author organizes the article by first stateing what space junk is then gentally flows in to how it is a potentailly dangerous hazard for other space explorations and how this matter needs to be taken seriously
when people think of space they dont think about all the junk that is in it when we look up into space we dont see all the junk that is in it either but what we dont see is a problem when they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people dont believe it and all the stuff falls down to earth nut most of it dont i think its sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched
they tell us that we should look though a telescope and look thought it there is 33442 satellite the size of a baseball anything goes smaller this makes it difficult for spacecraft to steer clear of microdebris fields
the author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be for example it starts off in the first part stating over the past 52 years earths atmosphere this shows the variety and past of spacecraft the next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another this part leads into the present then finally it shows that how serious space debris is by statating those bits of space debris present a very serious problem the way the article is wrote is to show the effects of space activity
the author organizes the article very well the author starts with getting your attention he then gives background information on space next the author tells how the debris in space becomes uncontrolled finally the author says how small the debris can be and that this is a big problem
the author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention then the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space after that the author describes how satellites die and crash into each other creating microdebris next the author goes to explain the how little pieces of debris known as microdebris can be just as harmful as big pieces of debris and finally the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space
the author organizes the article first with a light engaging introduction followed by background information further explanation of risk and conclusive descriptions of the problems and what is being done about them
the author organizes the article in chronological order starting with the introduction and background information followed by the current problem and then how the problem will most likely persist in the future
the author organizes the articals by headings
the author uses subtitles to make to article different from others
he begins by telling us what space junk is and then tells us why it is harmful and what harm it can cause in the end he tells us how scientist are working on a way to fix the space junk problem
at first the author gives a great explanation on what he or she is going to talk about he or she starts to explain that space junk is bad for the globe then the author starts to explain what the space junk is it is the human races great space invasion of the soviet union and the united states satellites that have been launched in space the next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites if the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore the next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash or also called space junk that is in space floating around
he organizes it by what is more important to them and they go from there
the author starts with what is space junk which tells of space missions and how we invaded space then it tells of satellites and how they can crash then of microdebris
he puts it together by telling one problem after another
he puts it into interesting paragraphs and also puts it into interesting caterogies
the author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way the author has chosen to set it up by and seperate the paragraphs by sections not just spacing and indenting the author started with background information then transitioned into information about how free floating satellites and then concluded with statistics and information from nasa and other space agencies about how space exploration should be done in a more organized and clean way
the authoe organizes this article in a series so titled paragraphs the fact that each section of paragraphs tells you what thoes will be talking about it gives you a little clue as to what you will be reading
he puts the article into sections he is not just jumping around form subject to subject he gives a title and the article or the section follows it below the title
the author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor its atool bag then the author told the reader about space junk and the risk it causes like dead satellites at the risk of colliding with each other  then the author lets the reader know that space junk is a big deal and people do care about it
in different paragraphs about different things
the author put the article under three main topics after the introduction under each topic he describes that topic with a lot of useful information

he organizes it so you better understand the issue  if space junk and little bits no big deal were switched you would have no idea what was being said
the author organizes the article by putting titles or what is going to be talked about above the paragraph one example is little bits but a bid deal the author talks about how much people really care about the lost tool bags or the tiny bits of space trash
by good details
the author organizes the article by using a catchy way to bring in the attention of the reader lines 14 illistrate this then the author begins to use facts and statistics to show how serious this topic was this was the authors main goal it seemed to show the reader space junk is a serious matter

he organizes it by what happened to the satellite during the colision what was going on before it happened and what will happen now after the colision
the author breaks down the information in to multiple sections it says what each section is about and sets the tone
how he organize the article was really good he did it like that to catch our attention and how he worded it
he uses sub headings such as what is space junk and crash course
they state alot of facts
the author organize the article by using headings that tell what the section will be about like the heading crash course that tells you that this section will be about something that is crashing into something
the auhtor organizes this article in chronilogical order first comes discovery of such junk in space then comes the explaination of why stuff is in space after that comes the resaon why such junk is created then the article explains how a little piece of junkcan do alot of damage last but not least they give information on what nasa and the european space agency plans to do with the junk in space
he organizes it by starting out with action statments to get the readers attention then he goes in and explaing what soace junk isas well with a few good stories
the author organizes the article into three different sections the first one is to explain what space junk really is because some readers might not understand the concept of it crash course shows why space junk is important the author used many details like the collision between a russian and an american satellite in february 2009 to show that this is a serious problemthe next section titled little bits but a big deal explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in earths orbit is a serious issue space junk should not be considered a minor matter
the author organizes the article in a way that helps readers get the main idea and important aspects of each topic on a simple level
the author organizes the article by separting each topic into sections and giving them a title this makes it easier to find information from the article and easier to read
he organized it really surpeirior well the cool things he did in this subject story was that he orgainzed with amazing statistics and other great facts about how much danger can space junk be
the author organizes the article with tittles for sections and details all organised together
the authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled pertinant sections each section relates to the main idea which is that there is waste orbiting in space the section labeled what is space junk describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from crash course describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut the final section talks about the size of the objects orbiting earth does not matter because the speed is what causes the most damage
the authorstarts off the article by saying what space junk is then he goes into how it all began and how some satillites will collide into each other some time causing big collisions at the end the author supports how this is a big deal and that we need to start preventing these dangers
the author organizes this article by usingbuilding the argument layout
he puts a title over every paragraph he puts something else like in space junk he talks about how space junk got up there
the author starts with an easygoing introduction that gets the readers attention the author then goes on to tell the reader what kinds of space junk there is what is really orbiting in space next the author explains to the reader how the satellites crash and debris is formed the author concludes with telling us that although people care about space debris and it causes many problems the problem is only getting worse the way that the author organizes the article is that he or she starts with minimal importance to their words as the article goes on the words become more important
the author organizes it by naming each of the articles a different name it makes it more easlier to find the certain article

the author organizes the article by making the first body parragraph what is space junk in that paragraph he explains the meaning of space junk in the second body paragraph he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space junk in the last paragrapgh he titled it little bits but a big deal meaning that even the little pieces of space junk can be a big deal the pieces are so little but yet so powerful
he gradually gets more in depth of what space junk can do no matter what the size
first it explains about the topic space junk then provides evidence that convinces the reader that its dangerous and then explains the importance of it
scientists are hardpressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junkboth the national aeronautics and space agency nasa and the european space agency
the author organizes the article by using different titles  by doing this he made it easier for the reader to understand
the autor starts out with an attetion getter to make the reader want to read it then he goes into a sort of chronological order he starts with what space junk is what is space junk how it is made crash course and then why is can be dangerous little bits but a big deal no one would know what space junk is if the author just started with why it was dangerous
the author organizes this article by he tells details about everything he talks about how the space junk is hurting earth     he talks about the past and life experiences     how this all started out by that austronaunt that lost a tool bag in space when fixing something and how it damaged the earth how little tiny things can damage the earth     how those two satellites had a collusion and 491 miles per hour causing everything to get destroyed
he explains every topic in a different section he begins with space junk which tells about junk and satellites he then explains other topic like crash course and other little things that fly in the air
the author tells about space junk floating around are satellites the author is mostly concerned about the satellites
the author organizes the article by putting things in order by the title  at first the tells us what the orbiting junk is then explains a little about how it can cause a crash and then how we need to get these out of space the is how the author organizes this article
the author starts off the paragraph that is designed to catch the readers attention from the beginning and keep them interested the supporting paragraphs to the article help explain the harmful effects of space debris and the purpose to the whole article and the conclusion again just simply explains the purpose of the article in a different type of writing
how the author organizes the article is he puts different information into a different catergory for example the category crash course is a section that talks about satellites crashing into one another
the author uses heading in alazised bold font seperate from the original reading that explain what the following words mean
the author definitely gets our attention with the gripping introduction but after that he starts telling us the history of space junk when he is done telling us about the history he then begins to tell us facts and statistics about the revelations that scientists and astronauts have concluded throughout the years
he separates them into different sub headings
the author organizes the passage by sections the sections are very detailed and get their piont acrossed
the author orginizes the article by using headings for each part
the author organizes the article by first using an introduction to get the readers attention and to introduce the topic that will be discussed he then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk the author uses his next few paragraphs to tell about a real life story that occurred due to this topic this story occurred in februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris he does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact his next paragraph is used to compare space junk to objects in real life which will help the reader understand better the author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts the last paragraph is the conclusion which is used to sum up what was said and to state that space agencies hope to come up with a sollution
obviously it is convenient to read under the four headings presented within this article he begins with an exciting introduction to his topic before establishing his thesis about the dangers of space junk he then goes on to describe the history of the worlds journey into the galaxy and touch on the unpredicted ramifications of such an adventure toward the end the author focuses on the modern problems created by space exploration and how it is imperative for them to be solved before considering future risks of more exploration
he states that at one point the orbital pathway was once clear but due to spaced exploration it has become clutteredthen the author points out who discovered space junkfinally he concludes his story by telling the real danger and serios problems of space junk effecting our planetfuturespace explorations and even nasa itself
he has the intro to the article then he talks about what space junk is and how it can be dangerous then in the next section it talks about how the satellites can crash into each other and how a tool bag fell out of an space station      he also talks about how space debris is a bad problem and how we have a lot of it the space trash is increasing
the author organizes this article by stating the problem of space junk and giving extra sets of information about each thing before the author leaves you with conclusion at the very end
the author organizes this article by separting each paragraph into different topics
the author has organized this article in a cause and effect type of organization the author gives an effect and then follows it with its cause then the whole part of the statement is supported with details to make it an informative article

the author organize the article by titles he does it this way to tell the reader what heis going to be talking about he uses dates to signify when the debris and satellites were put into space
in this story to organize things they sorted all the stuff out that they needed to put together so it isnt all in random places and so it all makes sense and none of it is out of wack
the author uses forshadowing in the second paragraph of the article to emphisize how a little tool box is actualy a big problem it is well organized by what happens to objects taken up into space
the author organizes it so that they talk about what space junk is first and then what happens if it is left alone they also tell a brief history of space exploration first and gets into more recent times at the end they talk about how space junk is becoming more of a problem
he organizes it by first getting the readers attention by using shocking statements in the introduction then the author tells the readers about what spack junk is exactly and how it becomes space junk then the author tells about because of so many dead satellites they can crash into each other cause they are freely orbiting the earth then he or she states that even though after crashes in space and all the little pieces of the satelillets can still harm the earth because of how much speed is being increased
he went by what happend first
the author organizes the articles by first saying what a space junk is the united states followed suit and thats when the human race begun the objects themselves however are positioned hundreds of miles above earththe second thing he talks about is cash course where dead stellites run the risk of coliding with eacht other like in february 2009 not only spectacular crashes that create debris he continues to the section little bits but a big deal were it gets really seriouswhen a tiny fragment traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft the amount of trash increasing has taken over
the author makes everything build upon each other first the aurthor grabbed the readers attention second the author got more serious and showed people actually care about space junk then the author ended the article by give statistics and statements that make the reader notice the severity of space junk
the author uses an attentiongetter at the beggining of the article to draw readers in  he then changes his tone to that of a more formal one  underneath the title what is space junk he familiarizes you with what exactly space junk is  next he uses crash course to desribe the possible dangers of space junk in outter space  lastly he emphasizes the seriousness of the problems space junk can cause
the author organizes the article where you can easily find the information needed
i think the story is organized in a informational kind of way at the begining the author starts off with an insteresting facts and throughout it it just tells about information
it explains how the outerspace is from beggining to end

the author organizes the article by splitting it up into subsections and having the title of each section give the reader a idea of what the paragraph is about
the author organize the article by the main reasons and then the conclusion statements abiut it i know this because when the first paragraph starts with what is space which kind of briefly talks bout space junk and then it talks about how more microdebris is made
the author organizes this article with an introduction into the topic followed by explaining the subject and the effects it holds  the author explains the subject through the paragraphs titled what is space junk  throughout these paragraphs the author gives examples of what space junk is as well as an example of what happens if space junk were in the earths atmosphere  the author follows with a description as to what happens after satellites become space junk  the author makes these description in the paragraphs of crash course throughout the paragraphs little bits but a big deal the author then explains the effects the space junk has on the spacecrafts sent into orbit
tells us the danger about things floating out into space
the author organizes this article by putting all different things about space when the author does that it shows that the author knows what he or she is talking about
the article is organized by explaining what the problem is what causes it and why it is so important the first section what is space junk emphasizes what space junk is the second section crash course tells the reader about how the space junk is created it talks about the collsion between two satellites that resulted in space junk the third section little bits but a big deal tells the reader the threat of space junk
he organizes it by ideas and a sort of time table his ideas lead into each other he starts with what it is followed be how it gets there then what  it can do once it is there
the author organizes this article orbiting junk into specific sections he goes through the order you need to know things he gives you the background or history of space junk then he went into crasc course which is talking about craches that has happened over the years finally he gets omtp little bits but a bif deal and this section talks about how small something can be but make a big problem
the author organizes the atricle by importance first he explains what space junk is then he explains crash courses then last he explains little bits of pieces that are big deals
about the bags fall from space and it called space junk it might hurt the earth
he grabs the readers attiention  in the introduction then explains what space junk is then how it gets to be junk in space the author then shows the big deal in space junk and why it should be solved
in sections titled with question
he first tries grabbing your attention and draws you in with a personal anecdote then talks about the orbital pathaways then he talks about space and the history of space and material used to examine spacethe author goes on talking about other stuff but he makes subtitles throughout the essay to organize his essay
the author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups we start of with the orbiting junk subgroup which is the opening paragraghs next we move on to what is space junk which explains the history of space exploration it also talks about the problems with this though and how when a satellite dies it just keeps going in space that is how we get space junk next we have crash course which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites this is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem last they have little bits but a big deal this part is the conclusion and talks about all the problems space junk can cause it gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag this is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is so that is how the author organizes this well written article it helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read
that these are very dangerous for satellites and rockets  they get a lot of damage if its the size of a baseball or even smaller it can still be dangerous
the author started it off a little funnybut then it started to get serious he started to talk about the problems he compared it to a sand blaster and how sand can mess up concrete walls it just depends on how fast it is going
he organizes this article by breaking it up on diffrent topics of the same subject for example under what is space junk he talks about the malfunctions and how satellites were first used under crash course he talks about satellites and their possibilities of crashing or becoming a freeorbiting satellite but under little bits but a big deal  it meantions about how tiny debris can cause serious problems
the author organizes the article by explaining what it is giving examples and telling why its important
he explains space really well and has tons of answers for his own qoustions
the author first catches your attention using the introduction in the introduction the author says grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor its a  tool bagthen the author explains what the item of the topic is and how it got there the author says over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft  have been sent beyond earths atmosphere after that the author explains the consepuences of the item by saying with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other the author follows up by saying tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft the author closes his article by explaining the way the situation is being taken care of the author says space agencies hope that the corporations and nations invelved can work together to come up eith a viable solution to space pollution
the author organize the article starting with action grab your telescopelook up in the sky its a comet its a meteorhe was trying to get the readers attencion there then he explained what is the space junkcrash course and the little bitsbut a big deal so people knew what he was talking about
the author organizses the article by taking the events of the of the colliuons
the author organizes it by dividing it into sections that reflect the size of the different types of space junk in the second section crash course the author explains the dangers of the larger debris while in the third section little bits but a big deal the author explains the dangers of small particles and objects to spacecraft
the author starts with the history of space junk it starts with back in the 1950s what happened with this so called space junk he or she then tells of the dangers of space junk and the harmful things it can do lastly he or she talks about the destruction it caused up in space saying that two simple satelites can crash into each other and then form many many little pieces from that explosion means they can crash more often and cause more danger
he starts off with an exciting start saying little interesting things about how lots of things such as satelites can cause problems in space he then slows it down showing the serious parts of wehat it can do to our space and orbit
the author hooks the reader with catchy statements and then goes into facts the author thengoes into what happens in space then into whats causing the  problems in space
first it talks about the launching of space crafts and what is space junkthen it talks about the risk of the dead satalites running into each otherand last they talk about the little peaces of trash or junk as being a big deal because they could damage the space crafts that are up there
chronological order
the author organizes this article in a way that someone who know nothin about the topic of space junk will be able to follow the text all the way through it is in other words arranged in order of increasing detail
the author organizes this article in a very educational way that flows smoothly also it shows how things happen in a sequensual order this happens by telling what space junk is then afterwards finding out how its created and the dangers of said space junk
the author makes various titles to catch ur eye by giving out some proof
they organize the article into sections that are important and give explanation the sections sre what is space junk crash coruse and little bits but a big deal
the author wanted to get the point that send space equipment into space is not a good idea but he explains how all the space junk is cluttering up all of the space outside our earth and it is comeing down back to earth
in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite
the author organizes the article by events that have occured the author first tells about the two satellites that crashed leaving debris in space then the author goes on and tells about the lost tool bag in space and how the debris from that is dangerous for space travel
he organizes it in a manner in which liitle problems turn into bigger problems in space
the author organizes the article using an introduction two body sections and then a conclusion in the introduction the author describes what the article is about by stating in paragraph 3 orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions the author gives excellent examples of how the space junk came to be and explained how and why these pieces of debris are not good the author concludes by taking the article a step forward and showing that we can solve the problem of space junk
they start by describing what space junk is then what happens to objects sent to space after some time and at last they tell what the big deal is with space junk
the autor organizes the article very well the introduction is very integuing pulling the reader in to find out what is the problem the author then goes into detail about how the junk actually entered the atmosphere the section titled crash course posses the problems that are radiating out of all the space junk this includes the problem of satelights running into each other the author then ends the article explaining how little bits of undetectable debrees can harm space equiptment
in this article the author organizes the paragraphs into an introduction mentioning space junk with humor a paragraph explaining what space junk is specific details about crashes that bring to light what could happen in the future a section describing the harmful effects of tiny debris and finally a paragraph that explains how the effects are increasing and how nations are working together to come up with a viable solution to space polllution this organization technique is common in information essays first the problem is introduced and from there the problem is discussed with background information statistics comparisons analogies and inferences for example the author uses the comparison of sand shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall in the section that describes the harmful effects of small debris
the author in the story organizes it in a very good way not only do they have an introduction body and conclusion but the story is intriguing and makes you want to read more the author also does a good job at the way she tells it
allright
this chapter was talking about   space and this explan as how biga nd how much the nasa are  having problems in the futere
the author organizes this with first explaining what space junk is and then supporting details he tells of how space junk comes about and how dangerous it is when he told about the instruments they use to study and how that could become dangerous he was providing details as to what space junk is
the author organizes the article by headlines before talking about the article for example the very first paragraph after the introduction has a headline that says what is space junk then it goes on to tell us about space junk after paragraph five it has the headline that says crash course and it goes on to talk about that and lastly after paragraph seven it has the head line that says little bits but a big deal and they go on to discribe that
the author organizes the article in a very logical way he begins by using an introduction that will get the attention of the reader he follows this up by giving us a brief history of space junk next he describes the severity of this topic lastly he concluds by proposing a sollution to this problem
he goes from an exciting first paragraph to two more detailed paragraphs
they organize it by telling you some facts about space and space junk then they tell you the problem it causes
he organized from the least amount of damage to what can cause the most amount
the organization of the article is simple yet very effective for the reader to truly understand the concept of space junk in the beginning with the article called orbiting junk the author creates an intresting lead in to draw in the reader after that paragraph the author proceeds in the body paragraph to tell the leader about space junk and the dangers that causes to other satellites i especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called little bits but a big deal i liked this because i had no idea that a tool bag would be such a treat if it was freefloating in space i like how it discussed the damages it caused by using a metaphor about sand and the dangers it held     through this organization of introduction body and conclusion the reader was able to understand how space junk is a serious matter
the author organizes this article by separating it up into different sections with different titles
the author organizes the article by having an interesting introduction that catches the readers attention  next the author explains the danger of the main topic mentioned in the introduction  throughout the article until the conclusion the author says how dangerous and improtant the issues can be  lastly the author explains how scientists are trying to fix the space junk problem
the author starts off with an introduction being excited about seeing something in the sky in outer space the author then talks about something at the end of the paragraph and then writes another paragraph explaining what that means and how it came about the author also gievs out information on what has happened in outer space when it happened and how it harmed us
the author starts out by explaining how the space junk got into the earths orbit then he explains the dangers that a little piece could cause on a spaceship then he explains how much space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is on the rise
the author organizes the article by putting it in sections that are related to eachother first the author explains what space junk is then describes the dangers of the junk and finally explains why the junk is a big deal
the author organizes the article in order from how the objects get  into space and then how they can crash into other things and cause many problems in space  the author rights it in sequented order to define the issue from start to finish
he organizes it into sections to explain space junk what has happened from space junk and why they are dangerous
they list the sections in order of importance to begin after they have the readers attention from their introduction they explain what exactly causes the problem that they will later define     next they use the section crash course to show that this isnt just a rare occurence that we will never really have to worry about but that it is a very problematic situation that we must prepare for     finally they show that as satellites colide and are smashed into smaller bits they become even more dangerous because there is a higher chance of them colliding because of their great numbers
he or she starts off by informing the reader what space junk is setting the tone making sure the reader understands whats going on first second he or she talks about the satellites crashing third he or she talks about no matter how small the debri is it can still do heavy damage when going five miles per second
because its about space junk and how it could cause things to happen in our world
he organizes it by bits of information
the author organizes the article by explaining what the problem actually is discussing what its doing to the space and that we need to find a way to fix it
by catching the readers attention then explaining what space junk is  it then gives examples of the consequences of space junk and emphasizes the dangers
the author organize the article by opening it with a brief introduction about space junk then he explain more clearly about space junk in the what is space junk next is the evidence of the danger sapce junk can make in crash course finally in little bits but a big deal the author points out how serious it is and space junk need to be solved by the corporation of nations
the author starts out by telling the reader about past space explorations and how long ago and when the space race began he also goes along and talks about how small debris in space can make a big inpact on the earth and the damage it can do to the earth and the people on it the author then goes along and talks about recent problems witht he debris in space and the two satellites crashing into eachother and the impact it had on the planet
he creates sections of information about different topics he starts by telling the viewer about early launches of sattelites and telescopes and other things into space and works his way down to when they collide together and ends with the importance  danger of little pieces of material in space
the aurther organizes the article by keeping certian articles separated what is space junk deals with the information of space junk like like information of what happens to all of bits and pieces lost in space     as for others like obiting junk just deals with a small novel that gets the readers attention
labals the titles
the author organizes it so that is is like sections of a chapter in a textboook it is all focusing on the same allaround topic but the sections are there to make it more specific
the author organizes the article with little articles in it the first one grabs the attention of the reader and gives you an idea on what the article is going to e about the second one is to help the reader understand the history of space exploration and how long people on earth have been doing it the thrid one is all about satellites colliding together and creating space junk the last little article tells the reader how small but still very dangerous the space junk is
he says that theres getting more and more things up in space and eventually things will crash
they organize by the dates and years
he starts out by asking a question then he tells us the reader the answer and explains it and what it isthen paragraph by paragraph he gives more information about it nand explains more and more about it and also gets into better detail
the author organizes this article by importance for example he or she talked about space junk crash course and then talked about little bits but a big deal
i think that he or she organized the atricle to be interesting but at the same time informing the reader about what is going on with space junk and other problems it can have
the author gives the problem first then the author gives details about it and some examples then the author explains why its important and what should be done
the author has alot of good information about space junk and he states that in every paragraph he states it by saying statisics about the size of junk the collisions and what may happen in the future
it gives a background a story then a future cause for concern
the author starts off by getting the readers attention in the introduction then the author explains what space junk is after that the author explains how it happens finally the author wraps it up by explaining what damage little pieces of debris can do to a spacecraft
the author organizes the article in a way to inform the reader about the subject generally then becoming more specific  the author starts off by describing what the subjest is what is space junk  then the author goes on talking about satellites crashing and making space junk  the author later goes on to explain the big deal of space junk in little bits but a big deal
the author organizes this article by section of what happened in those time periods each section has information on the topic of the section some section of the story are about certain things so if your looking for something important you can look in the certain section were you think youe can find it
the author organizes this article by an intro duction that is fun and gets the readers attention and he also uses information to back up his research that he thinks is right he also talks about them loosing a tool bag in space like this quote  the lost tool bag for example is listed as satellite 33442 the lost tool bag is in the article for humor they are trying to come up witha solution to space pollution
the author organizes this article in an order that tells you what they are talking about what it is and the problems it causes it is a very cause and effect type of order an example being how they first tell you what space junk is and then go on to tell you how it is dangerous to have the junk floating around in outerspace because they run the risk of coliding with eachother
the author first tells you what space junk is then the author gives examples of how debri can be dangerous by telling you two stories about satillites crashing at the end of the article the author tell the harmful effects space trash can cause
the author arganizes the artical by separating the information into sections that best fit the category that they belong to orbiting junk the title of the artical clarifies how space junk is a concern to government space agencies around the globe what is space junk defines and gives history to what the term means and how it came to be just as how it sounds in the heading of the section
the author put it in different catagories like what is space junk and he talks bout what it is
the author starts off by explaining what his story is about and its defining what space junk is he then tells how it is made and how big of a threat it causes for us and other satellites he then tells about the destructive force of a little peice of sand
scientists are hardpressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk
they organized it by stating the problem saying what is causeing the problem and how it got there
first the writer grabs your attention with the introduction then the writer tells you about the space trash in the section titled what is space junk next he talks about how the satellites in orbit now can get smaller due to the fact that they could run into each other causing more debry in the section titled crash course and finally thewriter tells us how the little objects floating around there now are a big deal and the more that the satellites break the more debry their will be in the future that section is title little bits but a big deal
he organized this article by putting the facts of satellite in order and telling the reader about each section which is talkin about the satellites
he starts with  a attention getter then goes to statistics and facts then he states the problem he talks about a solution then he said that these little things are a big problem he also said that the solution is difficalt to find
the author of orbiting junk organizes the article by opening with an introduction following with background information supporting information and ending with a conclusion
the author organizes this article into four main parts orbiting junk what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal
the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is then explanes the crash course of the satellites and debris after that it explains they are little bits but a big deal the author uses all of them combined to explain the importance of space debris and there effect on space travel
the author organizes this article into smaller subtopics which explain different aspects of space junk  each subtopic such as orbiting junk and crash course highlights an individaul aspect of the problems caused by space junk while supporting the authors statement that space junk is a serious problem
he or she starts out with how the space race started an how countries started sending satellites one afte another like with soviet union an the united states the goes with how when the satillites die the may run into anothe satellite an that may cause tons of debris and how its harmful to earth an space
the author organizes the article by catching the readers attention in the introduction then the author does a history of space junk then the next paragraph the author talks about crashing satellites the eight paragraph talks about little pieces of space junk and how they can be dangerous and in the last paragraph the author states that the problem is increasing and the worries of space agencies
the author of orbiting junk organizes the text in a cause and effect manner the author begins with the beginning of the space race which began to cause debris to be left in outer space  he then procceds to other ways to create space junk such as colliding satalites  he then demonstrates the problem posed by the orbiting garbage which causes individuals to begin searching for a solution  since most of the authors major topics are caused by the one before the author arranged his or her piece in a cause and effect pattern
the author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand first he introduces us into what the whole piece will be about and gives us the main idea then he explains what makes the space junk next he gives an example of how the problem becomes more serious finally he gives a lot of facts that describe how big of a deal this really is
the author begins the article with a kidding tone  the introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections  what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal are all have a much more serious tone  what is space junk gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is  it also foreshadows the potential problems of space junk by asking what happens when a satellite dies or malfunctions  crash course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves  such as colliding satellites  little bits but a big deal describes other bad situations of space junk and the very serious problems they can cuase  problems like disastrous holes
the author starts off with something interesting to get the readers attention then he expalined the reason for his opening statement after that he told us what space junk a little background history and simpla facts about it then he closes with why it matters why they little tiny space debris or junk matter because it is harmful
they organize it by making up sections for example what is space junk and crash course having sections makes it easier to find the information youre looking for

he organizes it by sections by 3 different parts one is what is space junk crash crouse and little bits but a big deal
intro beginning middle end first by using shocking statements to grab your attention then once the reader has your attention heshe provides you which researched information and the hard facts after providing the facts heshe explains the various problems space junk can create lastly heshe leaves you with a few things to think about
the author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way  first the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings the author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories the subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of space junk this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the article is organized under different headings and the headings are explained  also the years of different facts go in chronological order
the author starts out with surprising statements to alarm the reader and to make them attentive the author also has the titles of each section titled appropriately and accuratly to help us understand the seriousness of trash in space we take space for granted most of the time and we have no idea of the dangers of the junk up there that can actually do harm to earth itself
the author organizes the article by starting off with the question what is space junk in the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space then there is another title crash course those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other then there is another titled little bits but a big deal those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space
the author organized the article orbiting junk by adding different sections of reading  in saying sections i am referring to the titles through out the article  what is space junkcrash course little bits but a big dealthose titles are all examples of how the author organized his article
the author organizes this article in a simple yet effective way they have chosen one main point which is space junk and created a few subtopics by doing this they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem     the article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on which is orbiting junk next they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves what is space junk well after reading the second paragraph we know what that is after this we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system last of all we read that no matter how small the object is it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere      because these smaller topics are separated from each other the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk
the author writes this article so that the term space junk is explained in the beginning  the process of the object becoming a space junk is explained in the beginning followed by the dangers that occur because of it  this article is organized so that the reader is informed about space debris little by little  after being informed on how the dead object can cause harm the reader then learns about why space pollution is becoming a major problem       the way this article is organized helps the readers be informed on space pollution without recieving too many information at once  the article is divided into sections then paragraphs allowing the reader to understand more easily the information that is being given to them
he organizes the article by titling things in sections like what is space junk and only talks about what is needed in that section and crash course is another way the author broke up the article
he oragnizes the article by catching the readers attetion before explaining the serious issues of space junk he then explains what space junk is so we understand what he is talking about later on the article better after he explains what space junk is he talks about the history of us invading space and how stuff gets left behind then he explains how space junk is a serious matter to earth and the people heading to space
the author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions both satellites traveling at more than 20000 mph crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world
he organizes through chronilogical order
the author organized the article with different headings and sections
the author starts out as if its going to be a good story then the author goes into how dangrous the orbiting junk can be under  what is space junk they tell you over the past 52 years a variety of spacecrafts have been launched into space in  crash course the author tells you  with no controls dead satellites ru n the riskk of colliding with eachother last but not least in  little bits but a big deal the author tells you that scientists are hardpressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk
the auther puts the article together in different sections first there is the hook and intro then there is some background info and then the statistics and current matters on this subject
he organizes it on how much the reader will learn and how much the reader will read and comprend he doesnt want his reader getting bored after the first paragraph
the author organizes the article by talking about a certain subject but then hinting to another subject this hint gives the reader a sense of knowing what is coming up for instance in the introduction she mentions space junk but then she moves into another paragraph explaining what it is at the end of that paragraph she mentions it circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit this led into the crash course paragraph and so on
it is organized by how it happens in chronological order the satellites would have to crash before they would have junk fall off of them
in this selection the author organizes hisher main points into sections that relate and flow from one to the other for example heshe use the transition form the main title orbiting junk to what is space junk these sections describe what space junk is then heshe transition into the dangfers of space junck by using titles such as crash course which transitions into little bits but a big deal these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites the author organized hisher selection in a way that flows from one point to the next
the author begins the article with an attention grabber in order to make the reader interested in the topic  giving the reader a little information regarding space junk the author clarifies the topic and gives details in the second section what is space junk  describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk  the author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris stating that the objects in space are similar to sand shot from a sandblaster  the author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem
they talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space they give an example about when the soviet union launched the first satellite inter outerspace     then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space the problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite that hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space the space shuttle isnt moving that fast and is very delicate      the amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations they are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space
the author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections the author doesnt fuse his or work together
the author first draws the readers in by using an attention grabber then the author gives the reader some history about space then he processes on telling the reader about the harmful risks that are accurring  in space
first the author started talking about the basic information about the space junk and then he wrote what it is use for and also talked abour all rhe dangerous and safety thins about the space junk
the author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better the article starts out with definition what is space junk goes to how some space junk is created crash course and then goes to why space debris is a big deal in little bits but a big deal
the author organizes this article by true facts he first talks about the history and how satellites first started out in space then he goes into if the collide what would happen and how it would be harmful to space he lets you know how some of the satellites travel how fast they move per second he lets you know that when they do collide harmful things can come from it he organized it so that after you something benefitial he urges that something bad can also come from something good
the author organizes the article by having headings for different topics  this makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic  the author begins the article with a common phrase its a bird  its a plane  its superman  but with a unique spin  the author then presents a heading what is space junk to show that the fun friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning  from there the author uses a new heading iecrash course little bits but a big deal to show when he is about to begin a new topic
he starts out with a more general topic then he gets into more specific topics like space junk then he goes on to say crash course and gives a example how a american space craft and a russian craft carshed then the auther talks about the debris in the orbit around the earth
the author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author of this article organizes it into four different sections the author introduces a problem gives the history of this problem tells you how it occurs the finally tells you why it matters
the author organizes this article into the past the current and our future lives the author organizes this article in a way that the atomosphere seems crucial to our planet
the author organizes the artice in a simple way the author grabs the attention of the reader first the author does this by a comical statement then the author goes into how serious of a problem it is right when he grabbed your attention he gives you simple facts from history and just flat out tells you things so that you dont have to read between the lines he tells you the basics and then sums it up by saying how important and dangerous space trash is and leaves you to think with that
the author begins by giving backround information explaining how common space junk is formed then leads into how tiny bits of space junk are formed and finally how these small debris are a big problem
the author organizes the article by putting it in order of what is space junk to why it effects us in the article it mostly states all of the problems people have had going into spacetheir problem all talk about getting hit or crashing into something floating in space
the author started off by telling us what space junk is then went into the different catergories what is space junk is the title for the first couple of paragraphs
the interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about what is space junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there crash course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher and the last paragraph tell how all this is really a big deal and something should be done about it
they break it into sections which allows the reading to get a better understaning for example in the introduction grab your telescope allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence in the what is space junk section in 1957 the soviet union lunched the first artificial satellite this give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on in crash course with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding wih each other this shows risks and what could happen little bits but a big deal those bits of space debris present a very serious problem shows why we should be worried
the aticle goes from attention getting to informational then it is jus importance of space junk
the author orginizes the article by putting things together for example crash course has information about satellies and other things that crash into other things they put like information together so its easier to go through and find things
it starts with an introduction then it gives subheadings with facts about the subheading
the author organizes the artical into groups he explans all of the groops what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal e explanse what will happen or what could happen in space if something runs into each other or if an astronaut droped something wile working
he organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you then he tells you what space junk is basically after that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth little bits but a big deal shows you that some people might not really care about those tiny forms of debris but you actually should if they go at a very fast speed
he organizes the article from history to crashes tothe problems that concern micro debris and what is being done to stop it
by telling facts about satellites in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite
the author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about the next paragraph is what is space junk which is telling us what space junk is which is the cause for all the debri and junk in space the next paragraph is called crash course which tells us what the space junk has caused in space  the last section is little bits but a big deal and it tells how people feel about the junk and what is going to happen to it all
the author organizes this artical of how these project help the earth but can also harm the earth
like the way he starts it of gets you in it then he start to describe them in sections and certain parts to make the article good and didnt stick on one sublect but speard it out and also had facts in the article some of the things they do when they are in space and the oblects they use
from talking about what is space junk then the author talks about the most serious concepts of what space junk can do to spacecrafts in orbit
the author organizes the article with specific titles for each section  for instance one of the titles is called crash course  this section of the article explains how satelites and other debris floating in space can potentially collide and screw up satelites with will affect global communication
the author organizes this article by beginning with an introduction leading into 3 main paragraphs and ending with a conclusion
he breaks the topics into differnt sections so they can be read and understood more clearly
by informitive paragraphs
he organizes it by detail
the author starts with a great attention getter that is a concerning statement then he goes into the history of when the human race first did something with space the russians launch a satellite then the auther goes into how debris can get into the orbit by telling us that satellites do crash into eachother then he goes into how these little peices of deebris are a big deal because they can be caught and pulled down to the earth at enormous speeds
by putting them in order and using titles of his story to catch yur eye and make u want to read how inportant it is
the author organizes this article by putting headings at the top of the page and keeps adding new ones when he changes subjects it lets you know the good about space junk and the bad about space junk then it goes into the sizes of stuff how even the little pice of sand is a big deal and could really hurt your space craft
the author organizes the article into sections that explain what it is what is couses and how we are affected each section is wsell informed and organized such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled crash course
the author organizes the article with an introduction and three body paragraphs      paragraph one gives a brief history of the great space invasion and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites telescopes and space capsules that cannot be repaired     paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space resulting in hundreds of microsatellites     finally paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter stating that at extreme speeds small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment a solution is difficult but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space it also emphasizes the growing number of satellites capsules telescopes etc being sent into space and how therefore space trash is increasing
this author organizes the article first with an introduction to grab the readers attention the introduction introduces us to what the rest of the paper is going to be about the author then is able to explain exactly what the paper is about with what is space junk he then gives us an example of what is going on with the problem and then why it is important and what is being done to help it
the author starts out the article with an introduction the will grab the readers attention and make them keep reading he also catorgorises each section with a title like what is space junkcrash course and little bits but big deal to let the reader know what each paragraph is about the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions
the author organizes the article by first grabbing the readers attention then describing what space junk really is then how space junk is formed and lastly why we should care about it and what we can do to reduce space junk

the author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be at the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone that is how he organizes the article
they organize it into subject matter what is space junkcrash cource and little bits bit a big deal they also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections
the author organizes this article in a interesting format for example he introduces us with dialouge between two people then he changes his tone into a serious matter and explains what he is going to talk about      also he divides his paragraphs into topics so we know what the next paragraph is about this shows that he is very organized and wants to keep us organized as well while we are reading it
the author organizes the article about aspects of space exploration in a specific way the author first gives the reader an attention grabber in the introduction then the author informs the reader about a brief history about space exploration and space junk from there the author talks about satellites and how space junk can be harmful to the surface of the earth
the author organizes the story by first explaining where and when the space junk first started and where it came frm then the story later explains how these little problems can became a very serious matter
grab your telescope look up in the sky its a cometits a meteor
the author put this articke in different collums and explains what each of the headings mean
he starts off by giving information on the history of satellites then goes into detail on how satellites can collide with eachother that is when he then explains why space trash is bad
in this article the author does a great job at organizing all of his information i think that it was good that the author had a main title and an introduction that explained all that he or she was going to talk about and then the author had subtitles when they were going on a new topic i know that when the questions came up it was very easy for me to find the answers because the subtitles organized it very well
the author shows good organizational skills with the way he or she wrote the article he or she started out with suspence then went into some history then ended with a warning about the dangers of space junk
the first part of the artice he uses the word space junk then in paragrphs 4 and 5 he explains what it is and how they circle the earth in there own orbit in paragraphs 6 and 7he talks about what happens if two of the satelites collide together then it forms tiny peice of material that cant be seen from earth also in the last paragraph he tells how the tiny peices of debris still plays a big part in space
the author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction and three sub topics  i agree that space junk could become a big problem  i feel this way because the qoute if you find that hard to believe compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall  that qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force
the author organizes the article by giving information about space junk then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other  the ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem  there are even titles to go along with the clasifications including what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author organize the article in a way that allows the reader to easily comprehend what the paragraph is describing by telling what each topic pertaines toit also allow the reader to go back and review a certian section quickly
the author organizes the article into four major groups the introduction what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal

the author organizes this article into diffrent categories in the categorie called what is space junk it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere in the article called crash course it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008
it is organized in different sections to make it easier to understand
the author organized this article very well  after introducing the piece he went straight to informingeducating his readers about how space junk came to exist  he then moves on to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk followed by the importance of awarness and concerns of space junk  he informs his readers how the various pieces of junk can be harmful to machinery that scientists send into space but alo how the damage from the collisions of space junk to said machines is unavoidable  the author then ties up the peice with how space agencies are hoping to work with other coroporations and even nations to come up with a solution to the space pollution
the author seperates it into sections and in eaach section heshe puts some very interesting facts in there for the reader
he first draws in the readers attention then informs them of what space junk is third he informs them of how space junk is caused fourth he informs the reader of how even the space junk pieces may be small they can also be very dangerous
he starts out with a introduction next he defines what the problem is after that he tells the reader why its a problem the last paragraph is his conclusion and why it needs to be stopped
the author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk then he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph the ending paragraph in that section talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit leads to the next main point crash course that talks about the american and russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path also it says that accidents do happen and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the international space station this leads into little bits but a big deal in this paragraph it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash this leads into the subject that many people do infact care it then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion
the author organized this article in a very neat way by dividing the categories up into iindividual sections it is very easy to read its rather refreshing
the author describes how space junk is prodused and what causes it to become small bits of space junk the artical starts with satellites and works his way down to what microdebris is made of
he get information and tells it how it is bad and dangers to the world and in space
he organize his article in the way he is talking about what is space junk in one seccion crash course in other seccion and little bits but a big deal in other seccion so we can understand better because everything is not together
the author talks about different space topics ever part of the artcle have its own topic an whats its about like the different parts of the article
this article is organized with a fairly common format first is a small shocking anecdote which serves to grab the attention of the reader then are a few sections highlighting the necessary details the reader needs to know to fully understand the problem such as an explanation of how space junk comes to be and how space junk is so dangerous these are followed by a conclusion paragraph highlighting the most important information to help the message sink in one last time
the author organizes this article from begining to end the author starts with simple factas and attention getters then makes the way down towards the imoportant facts the author has three major facts and he supports them with detail and then give their overall veiw of their oppion on the article
the author organizes this article by first catching the readers attention with lines 1 and 2 in the introduction with an unbelievable statement that seems false next the author wants to tell you about the history of sattelites and other objects we have sent in to space and how they are still orbiting this earth this lets the reader know there is a ton of waste in our atmosphere crash course and little bits but a big deal tell us how dangerous all of these large and small bits are to astronauts and sattelites at the end of the last paragraph the author concludes that scientists are trying to find a way to clear or avoid these bits of matter therefore that is how the author organizes this article
the author organizes this article by having headings  the heading what is space junk lets you know this passage will be about space junk and what it is  each heading helps the reader know exactly what they will be reading about this is a good way of keeping an article organized
the author first starts out by explaining how space junk got there and the growing knowledge we have of space and its history then he explains how and why satellites are colliding with eachother in every paragraph there is a different explanation of the effects of space junk and debris
sections
space travel from 1957 union launched the first space satellite to go to the moon
the authot begins by catching the readers attention with several shocking statements  once the reader has learned the subject of the article the reader then goes on to explain a simplified history of the subject of space debris  after explaining how so many satellites have been put into orbit by multiple nations the author gives a few examples of colisions that have occured in the recent past followed by the damage that can be caused from these crashes  the author concludes by highlighting the importance of the subject refering to examples previously stated in the article such as that concerning the lost tool bag
he organizes like from harmless to harmful saying that it is getting worse and worse over time
the author starts with shocking statements to grab the readers attention  the author then follows by defining the meaning of the articles topic  the author uses facts and statistics to suppport his opinion on the dangers of space junk
the author first uses a funny statement then uses a more serious passage about the begining of satelites then to how these satilites can sometimes crash causing debri to scatter then finally how these little peices of debri can become lethal
the author of orbiting junk effectively organizes his piece to inform the reader of the dangers of space trash he begins with an introduction and gives the reader interest along with the basic background needed to understand the purpose of the article      the author then moves into the section of what is space junk where he proceeds to the story of the great space invasion he tells the reader of the many satellites within our atmosphere from this race and introduces the idea of the satellite malfunctioning and creating space junk     in crash course and little bits but a big deal the author uses strong language unknown problems with space junk and a real life example to convince the reader of how harmful space junk is to the human race he ends with a conclusive paragraph that the dangers of space junk are actually increasing leaving with the small hope that there is a solution in the works to stop the space pollution
the author organizes this article so that it is easy for the reader to understand the author starts by explaining what the problem is in the section what is space junk he then explains in crash course what happens and then in the last section little bits but a big deal the author explains to the reader why this problem is such a big deal
the author starts out with a humorous exploration of a toolbag which is later explained the tone is switched to a more serious one and talks about how the space junk is dangerous the author brings in some history which is needed to explain a few things afterwards the article tells how the microdebris can destroy things launched into space and gives an analogy to give a picture then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing  and how it is a huge problem
the author organized the article by havinf four different things about space and naming each paragraph with a different title
from year to year
the author starts off with questions and then he goes on to talk about things and objects that are out in space next he is talking about collisions and more then even though some things are small that they can still cause a great deal of damage
he explains what he is talking about by saying he sees some space junk in the sky next he explains what it is and gives some background information on it then he explains how it causes satellites to collide into each other objects in space are considered orbiting satellites which is dangerous for astronauts finally he explaines exactly how it is dangerous and what he can do
the author organize the article by what is space junk in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite the next section is about crash course with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other the last section is about little bits but a big deal actually many people do those bits of space debris present a very serious problem
he organizes it by spac junk
he starts by creating an introduction which explains the problem in the next paragraph he tells the reader how the problem got there then in the third paragraph he tells you what happened the final paragraph explains the danger ther problem has caused
he organizes this article in finding the problem providing a reason for that problem and then he demonstraits how people are trying to fix this problem
orbiting junk over the 52 years he a variety of spacecrft includ space capsules telescope and satelites
the author organizes the article by headlines he uses the headlines what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal to seperate information
the author organizes the article by using headings the different headings talk about some of the topics that have to do with space junk under the section titled what is space junk the author explains how the engines used to power spaceships are disintegrated under crash course the author explains how sattelites colide into eachother finally the in little bits but big deals the author explains how the little things that are inspace can potentially cause great problems
first the author starts out very enthusiastic and wanting to actually tell you about the topic he wants to express the author uses a very catchy introduction and it really got me hooked from the first time i read it then he gets serious and starts telling about how space junk is really a harmfull thing and we are under estimating what it can do then he starts talking about crash course which tells you how people cant control dead satellites but they are still a major threat
the author breaks the article up into four parts orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
to help the readers understand whats going on around them
the author broke the article up into parts in order by explaining what one matter was about and then moving along to the next growing more and more in depth with each passage
well the author says space junk can become bad and sometimes end up really goood but on the other hand space can always mean damage to other thing that our out in space
their have been lots of sattilest launched into space in the last 52 years most of them are orbiting the earth over time the sateillite breaks apart due to the lack of maintness
the author first begins with an introduction to what the article will be about they then move on to overviewing what space junk consists of and how it came to be after that they deliver information about satellites crashing into one another and how that forms debris that orbits around our earth finally they discuss how big of an impact this debris can have on our atmosphere and earths surface
he divides the article into smaller subarticles so it is easier to organize what information goes where he has headlines that tell you what he is going to talk about before he begins
the author organizes this article by problems to how it effects our planets and solar systems this is shown by the 9 through 11th paragragh
the author organizes the article by explaining what the article is about and then telling how dangerous it can be even if it is only a small piece what is space junk tells about what it is and how long it has been up there and when they figured out what it was the section crash course tells about how the little particles in space can damage the satellites even if they are small pieces the last section little bits but a big deal tells about what the fragments can do to a satellite it also tells how the spacecraft is designed to try to avoid the little particles but sometimes can not avoid them all this article explains what space junk is and how it affects the satellites it also explains how much damage something so little can do
the author puts the information in sections and titles them so that the reader can better underdstand the importance of what he is trying to get across
the author organizes the article by putting a title on each different matter that they are addressing what is space junk describes what it is they are talking about and informing the reader crash course is all about collisions with satellites and other space junk that is orbiting the earth last but not least little bits but a big deal states various instintances where tiny debris can harm the biggest of objects due to the speed that it is traveling and the dangers of having space junk the author lets the reader know what each part will be about
by labeling what section of the story and what it is going to be about and he keeps it too were he dont jump off of the topic or anything
the author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat the author then goes on to give background information about how alot of the debris gets into orbit in the next section section the author describes what happens to the debris when it is outer space and how it can pose major problems finally the author explains the threat of the debris to humans and what is being done to counteract the space pollution
the author starts out with his thesis statement paragraghthen sums everything that he or she wanted us to know in his supporting paragraphs lastly he gave us an introduction and some final facts in the end of his article
he organizes the article by putting the educational facts in one paragraph and the interesting facts in another he separates all the different things and tells you about them induvidually
in this article the author organizes the story by arranging it in a good way and not using too much facts starting with descirbing the space debris at the begining was very good because it allowed the reader to know what it is and how it is created also i liked how he ended by putting in a lot of facts and telling us that we are working hard to get rid of the space debris
the author organizes the article by putting the main topics in seperate paragraphs and explains them throughly each topic is explained and has lots of information about them theres diffferent information in the text but its all refers to orbiting junk
the author organizes the article in small sections with only a few paragraphs to explain the subtopic in each section the subtopic what is space junk consists of two paragraphs it is all under the main topic orbiting junk
they organize it in sections explaining space junk and how it all got there they also give history behind it all
the author organizes this article to put in different important information they also do this so people will not get so confused when they are reading the author also put in the different sections so if you want to read the diiferent parts in a defferent order that they come in the author organizes the article so it has chapters when you read the article it is easier for someone to remember where or what they were reading about
the auther writes this artical as if he were writing a newsletter
the author separates the article in 4 different categories the order of the article is the introduction explaining what space junk is explaining what happens in space with the space junk and lastely explaining the dangers of space junk
the author organizes this article by starting out with a general idea then focusing into details of that idea as you continue on in the section in the introduction the idea of space junk is first introduced in a catchy way next in the first section space junk is defined for the reader and it is explained why space junk is in space then in the next section crash course some problems with space junk are introduced as well as some more details finally in the last section the idea that space junk can be problematic is introduced supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article the author has organized this article by starting with a general topic of space junk then adding more detail and ideas to that topic as the article continues
the author starts off by giving background information about junk that orbits in the orbiting junk headline the author then proceeds to give the reader background information on space junk in the what is space junk headline the author then goes on to talk about spack junk and its path and possible collision course after that the author shows how little pieces of junk can have a huge and costly impact on the space inviornment the passage is written like an essay with an introduction body and a conclusion
he orgainizes it in many different paragraphs to maybe break down each sudject like he put it in different titles to tell you just the main things about that topic and maybe if its broke down you will understand it more
the author organize this article form what he now about space and finds information on space the information he finds is that the soviet union had launched the first satellite in space than years later the united states launched there first satellite
in smaller articles to get the most detail in with the smallest amount of work possible in the most understandable way
the author organizes the article in a way that allows the reader to understand what is happening most readers do not know what space junk is and the author uses their organization skills to tell the readers how the junk came to be and how dangerous space junk can be
the author organizes this article in different sections he first starts off with an intro he then has a paragraph about the history of space junk and satellites finally he talks about the importants of dead satellites and small space junk
the author starts out by telling the reader that a tool bag is floating in space the next section entitled what is space junk explains how disabled satellites can become junk orbiting the earth the next section entitled crash course explains how satellites can collide with each other and create many more dangerous freeorbiting satellites the final section entitled little bits but a big deal expalins how the smallest space junk can create problems such as damage to space craft
the author put titles about pargraphs that descibe something about space junk the begining of each new section tells you facts about debris or history that gets you interested on reading more what is space junk tells you about how junk got there in the first place talking about the first launch and the space race in the cold war crash course tells you about some of the recent collisions among satelites and what people have left behind little bits but a big deal talks about how even the smallest items can damaged a space craft it also tells about how it is increasing and becoming more of a problem
the author organizes the article by using a title for each paragraph telling the reader what each section is about
he explains all the stuff in space and all the things that could happen
the author organizes the article in discriptive paragraphs the subtitle what is space junk describes the history of space travel and how space junk is created the subtitle crash course provides a specific example of space debris being created the subtitle little bits but a big deal describes the harmful effects of space junk
like starting off on asking what is all the junk in are space second off crash course they are meaning that are ssatellites are colliding into each other third they put little bits but a big dearl they mean that there anly little pieces of rubbel that is coming back down to are earths surface but there could possible bigger pieces later on that could come back down at us
the author organizes the article by first starting out with an explanation of spacecrafts first going into space then the author talks about the satellites and when theyre broken how much of an impact they have on the earth also the author explains how the space junk and microdebris fields are made and how they cause problems for spacecrafts
the author first starts off with an interesting introduction by providing rhetorical statements like its a    tool bad then the author gives the reader a background on space junk and what it can do out in outer space the author then concludes that this debris or junk can collide in space and the little fragments can cause damage as well as big fragments
the author organized this article with different tabs he split every paragraph up into different topics
the author organizes the article by putting it in sections  each title foreshadows what the section will most likely be about in the lines  orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions   is under the title orbiting junk  which fits the title perfectly
the author begins with an attentiongrabbing introduction next they explain what caused the space junk to accumulate then the author warns us of what may happen if we continue to pollute space finally the author states facts that support their statement
the author begins by grabbing the readers attention with a startling statement he continues to define the terms that will be used later on in the passage while also explaining some of the history behind the subject then the author offers more facts and support for his claims the author ends with a look at how the subject can alter the world around us
good not to bad
what the author is saying is that when we send up a satellite eventully they will brake and they wont get fixed so we send another one up their and some times they will crash into one another and that is how we get space trash
he puts all the most important information at the beginning
it provides a question and then provides information
he first starts with an attention getter then he explains to the reader what space junk is when is started and how he uses an example of space junk by talking about serious collisons with unsed satellites he then describes how fast things are really going in space by using sand as an example
he begins with a simple introduction which catches the readers attention then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about space junk once he gets to his point he starts explaining on how useful satillites become space junk over time on how it becomes space junk and dont get taken out and stay there orbitting the earth and end up crashing with each other and become more of a problem
the author organizes the article in catagories
the author organizes this article by highlighting the headings of each topic allowing it to stand out  the author also uses rhetorical questions
the author organizes this artical very well they get your attewntion with mutipal thing that draw your attention the author breaks all the important information up into paragraphs so the readers knows whats going on and can learn as much as possible for example the crash cource has nothing aboutnspace junk the author does a good job putting all the information that goes together into one paragraph they dont mix it up and confuse the reraders they make it easy to read and packed full with good information
they oraganize this artical by what happends for time to time
the author organized this article by using subtitles like what is space junk first the author grabed the attention of the reader than began to make the article
they organize the story by date and years the past events and events that happen now
the author organizes the article in chronological order      he or she stated that in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite in paragraph 6 they stated that in february 2009 two satellites collided into each other finally in 2008 they wrote about how a tool bag escaped from the international space station iss
the author organizes this article by an attention grabber then telling us what space junk is netx telling us about the collision of satellites in space then lastly the author explains the dangers of space junk in space no matter how small the space junk is it is dangerous
the author tell us what happens in space and how space agenices work to keep satellites from crashing to each other
to begin with the author organizes the article in which he gets the readers attention by saying grab your telescope look up at the sky its a comet its a meteor next the author tells the reader all of the background information about the space junk in this section it says in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite  then the article tells about the crash course finally it tells about how the little pieces in space are a big deal when they are moving fast these small pieces can cause damage because of the rate of speed that they are moving
the author opens this article atracting the reader then the author gives us facts about why sapce junk is a serious matter and its increasing so we should work together to make a solution
the author organizes this article in sections the first paragraph the introduction introduces the topic of the article the second section what is space junk provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly the third section crash course shows how the problem began the forth section little bits but a big deal shows how important the topic really is in regard to the pollution of the earth
the author organizes the article into three sections he talks about three very important probles in space one section talks about and describes what is space junk for example it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk the next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships the last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal
first theres an introduction and that gets you to want to read and figure out what the purpose of the story is then it explains what space junk is and gives history of how it has been made and some history about satellites after that it gives and example of a time in which an occurance has happened when two satellites collided then the story goes on about what precautions and how dangerous it is when they launch space missions or satellites i thought it was a good way to organize it all
the author does a very good job of doing the article he tells it step by step so people know what he is saying
the author organizes this article by putting a hook first grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor  then he proceeds to tell a breif hisory than he moves to talking about the actual topic of space junk
the author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other the introduction serves to catch the readers attention what is space junk informs the reader about what exactly space junk is and the final two sections inform us of the authors opinions on space junk
the aurthor organize the article by putting the information about when we start to first put satillites into space and then starts talking about other things about the satillites and ends it with they hope that the space agencies will come together and clear up space junk
in cadigories
he seperates different tpoics into different paragraphs in each paragraph he describes the topic and gives examples
the author organizes the article by breaking it up into smaller bits of information that all have to do with one another subject wise the sections in the article are arranged in a way that is easy to understand and gives information so you understand the next article this is obvious because if the author didnt give you the what is space junk part you wouldnt understand what space junk is in the next two sections
in sections to support the authors ideas
he organize it by putting it in a order where you would understand it better
the author organizes the article by providing an example of space junk why it is occuring and just how dangerous space junk can be in the first section the writer tells about the tool bag and how orbitals for stalites are cluttered in the second and third sections the writer is explaining what space junk is and how it occurs in the last section the writer talk about the problems space junk is posing and how it is more important than people think this organization is effective because the reader wants to continue reading for explanations and examples
the arthor gives many details why space junk is not good at all some people dont care when others do the author also puts the details in sections and all the information that they are talking about all in one paragraph and they dont skip around they tell us that some people take it seriously and some people dont play around with things like space junk
the author puts the information into categories
he he is careful on how he describes the way space jumk is made
the author starts on a somewhat fast pace trying to grab the readers attention it starts with how space junk got there and where it all came from and what they put in space then it goes to crash course which tells about how all them satellites and other space debris collide at speeds that are very fast and finally little bits which is about how the little debris can do a lot of damage to orbiting satellites
he seperates it into different parts
the author organizes this article by putting the information in different sections he puts the headings as interesting titles so the reader will be interseted before reading the article at the begging of the stroy he uses a retorical question to grab your attention
the author has organize the paper from introduction which hooks people to the story then the next paragraph he put the informatiom of the begin of the space and the space junk
the author organizes the article in a way for you to understand the seriousness of space junk it starts out funny but then goes into seriousness and then ends with satistics overall the author just wants to inform the reader on the seriousness and the dangers of space junk
aneye catching first line thats works its way into the article while using some unique words to catch your eye
the author starts off by telling us what space junk is which is debrie from satelittes and tools then he tells us how space junk is created he tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box next the author says that even the smallest bits of the space junk is harmfull and can do serious damage finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts
the author oraganized this article with three different titles that are important about space and what people put out there
the author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used he describes many of the passages by showing what can happen for example in crash course he tells about how satellites can come to collide with each other and cause serious damage and make more space debris also in the passage little bits but a big deal the author shows what can happen to an object whenever it gets hit by debris by noting what a sandblaster can do to a concrete wall
the auther organizes this pasage vary well in my retrospect the way he or she is trying to orginize the fallowing artical is into littel sections of diffrent paraphrase to help the reader orginize the diffrent information in there head so it makes it well writin
the article was about how a orbiting junk they talked about tool bagspace junk is currently of great
the author organizes this article with the facts first then alll the supporting details then what hes trying to get across witch would be the space junk can be very harmfull to anyone or anything travling through space
the author breaks the article into three parts which are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal the author does this so he can get the point of each section across in an easier way to understand
the author begins with an introduction intended to catch the readers attention  he then explores the topic in more detail using three different sections  the first one entitled what is space junk explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth  the next section crash course describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide  finally little bits but a big deal explains why space junk is a problem  and why it is important to find a solution
the author organizes the article by breaking down the main points into sessions instead of just reading it with no explanation it starts off with a problem the problem is explained the problem happens then finally it says how the problem can be taken care of       the introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article it holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky      the next two paragraphs explian what space junk is it tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space they raise the awarness of what is happening in space and how it could be a problem in the future      the section titled crash cousrse tells us the problem it says how it is not safe and how an accident happend in space with all the debris flying around       finally the last section tells us how we can care cleanup is possible but it is still dangerous in space many fragments float around that cannot be detected it also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free     the article is organized chronoligically they state a problem and throughout the paragraph they say what happens and how efforts are being amde to make it better
the author gets us thinking about space and the things that go on then gives us the history about the space exploration and the dangers there are in space the author tells us about all the space junk especially that can be seriously dangerous all the information lead up to the fact that there is a lot of junk floating around in space thats dangerous and that the satellites could collide because it has happened before
he orders the passge by what space junk is how it gets there and the problem it is causing
this article is based on the organization of things in space such as bad things good things and historical things this article has information about trash in space collision of satellites and junk throughout space
he puts the article in different sections to organize the main points in each section for example space junk can be anything released into space
it starts off with startling statements to pull the reader in then goes over a brief history about space junk then explains how dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other and then talks about the importance of space junk in the paragraph little bits but a big deal
what is space junk is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage it tells us some starter facts and other things     crash course explains a couple starter facts that introduce us to little bits but a big deal     little bits but a big deal kind of wraps up the entire passage and explains into more detail what space junk really is and the dangers of it  it explains that its not going like five miles and hour but thousands
the author organized the article by stating the problem  then telling what they are gives information about how serious this situation is
the author divides the article into 3 sections and an introduction   each section has a main focus but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris  the introduction is used to draw the reader in with odd statements that one does not usually here  then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination  the following section explains collisions involving space debris  the last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article
the author organizes the article by putting the information into catagories they give a brief summary in the introduction and go straight into the first section what is space junk the author explains what space junk is and how it is formed      next they go into what happens if two space satellites collide with each other in the crash course section of the article they give examples about this topic     and finally they end the article with the little bits but a big deal section this talks about the seriousness of space junk     so overall the author chooses to organize the article by sorting the information into subjects based on the different topics of space junk this makes the article very easy to read and to understand
the aurthor organizes the article by using headers  the author has an introduction and then information on the space junk itself what the space junk does and how big of a deal it is
the author organizes the article by catching the readers attention with the introduction and then give the reader son historical facts about how the space junk got into space the author then states that the satilites are at a higher risk of coliding with each other and causeing more debry the last section the author mentions is that the smallest debri can cause massive damage to a space craft that is in orbit
he organizes  it by atracting the reader then he goes into telling about the history and other facts about satallites next he tells about the importance of space junk and how it effects us
he organize the article in section of title
the author organizes the article in sections furst the author opens with an introduction to grab the readers attention then the author gives some background information about what space junk really is the author than staes an instance where space junsk acused an accident finally the author ends the article by telling of the dangers of space kunk and what it can do to effect the earth
the author for this article organizes it by first having an interesting hook to draw readers in such as grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor its atoolbag he then gives readers a little background information on the subject by explaining how space junk came about and how it affects astronauts finally the author ends this article by explaining to readers why space debris is such a huge problem
the author keeps this article organized by starting out with what is space junk telling and informing the reader about what space junk is and the history of space junk then it goes to the next section going into detail in the crash course artice where it talkes about how space junk is always colliding and in a crash course finially it talks about how the smaller pieces of junk could be the works parts of the junk in the little bits but a big deal section
the author organizes the artical by subtitles some of the subtitles they used are what is space junk and crash course
the author first introduces the idea of space junk and the governments concern with it he then writes of how the junk gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue he tells of the variety as well next he points out the danger of dead satellite collisions and again specifies some of the reasons that such debri occur in space he goes on to make sure that all realize that this is dangerous to themselves so that they do not blatantly disregard the article he emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space he also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel he also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution this organization is done to make sure to hold the interest of the reader until the end so that they will finish reading the article to educate themselves on the issue of space junk and how it pertains to them
the author organizes the article by giving information about space junk then providing the dangers of it they then explain how space junk is created by space capsules telescopes satellites and even astronauts themselves at the end of the article the author explains ways scientists are trying to solve the problem but will not be able to fully do so this shows how serious the problem is
it is a great concern to the government around the globe
he puts it into sections first he tells what space junk is next he tells how it is created last he tells how cares about this and tells that nasa is looking for a solution for space junk
the author divides them into three catagories to show as much information as possible in the first section he talks aabout the history then in the last two sections he talks about the serious risk of space junk

the author organizes this article into paragraphs of each topis with a title that sums up the main idea of the paragraph in the paragraph what is space junk the author talks about the history of space travel and things going and getting stuck in space crash course was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions and the last paragraph little bits but a big deal explains why space debris is so important do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple
he talks about the orbiting junk and how it goes around the earth he talks about what is space junk and how much trash there is in space he talks about crash course and how there is almost always crashes in space then he talks about little bits but a big deal and how much trash goes into space
the author organizes this article in an effective way it is easy to find what information that you will find in the different sections the author starts the article with a statement that grabs the readers attnetion then moves into explaining what space junk is and giving some back gournd information then the article moves into explaining the dangers of space junk and the potential that it has to affect earthly beings
the author organized the article using topic headlines  he or she chose to introduce the idea of space junk initially and called it what is space junk  the second section was about what happens when satellites collide crash course the third and final topic addresses the gravity of the situation expressing how consequential the microdebris actually is in little bits but a big deal
orbiting junk is about looking in the sky to find junkwhat is space junk is about different satellitescrash course is about satellites crashing in with each otherlittle bits but a big deal is saying space junk is harmful
the author organizes the article in a good sequence for example the author starts by telling you what is space junk then goes on to crash course and finally goes and tells you about little bits but a big deal
the author organizes this article into four main sections  the first of these sections is the introduction where he grabs the readers attention with an observation and the problem we are facing     in the second section of this article the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused the author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning     in the third section titled crash course the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse  he says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other they would create hundreds of pieces of debris     in the fourth and final section of the article the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us  spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology
the author organizes the article by firstly creating a good hook to get the reader interested in the rest of hisher article  from here the author explains the beginnings of space exploration and how space junk has been emerging as a growing problem since then paragraph 5  after this the author further explains and provides reasoning for the growing amount of space junk in the atmosphere and the problems it poses  after this the author explains why even the smallest objects can be the most dangerous and hazardous to spacecraft  finally the author wraps up the article by restating the problem increasing amounts of space pollution and by concluding the article
he puts his matters in a groups of his ideas then goes on to the next topic he has to talk about
firstly the author grabs the readers attention then author jumpss right into details as two what is space junk is and how it got into space thirdly  the author explains how satellites collide in space and become space junk lastly the author imposes on the danger and importance of preventing space pollution
the author organizes this article by representing facts and statements the author explains and tries to come up with a solution
the author organize the article by going straight in to 1957 the soviet union the first artificial satellite telling us the readers that they have been around for a long time and make sure you dont miss anything then the author goes in to 2009 telling us that the same thing happened dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other he also tell us about the future and what might happen if were not carefull
the article is organized is a way that makes it easier to understand for people who do not study in this field of expertise
the author how he organized it is by asking a question then he would answer it i felt that he went in order by years and important things that he thought we needed to know also he talked about how the soviet union did something before the united states and the united states didnt like that to well
he separates them into sections so the reader can find and understand the imformation that is in each section
the author organizes the article from doin an attention grabber to tell you what the article is mainly about  then it organizes the article from telling you what something is to how it happens
the author organizes the article delicately it begins with an introduction that explains about space junk then changes to a section devoted to specifically explain what space junk is finally the last paragraph is organized to explain how bad freefloating space junk can be
by putting up titles for each subject
in the introduction the author tries to hook the reader in about space junk  then he tries to explain what space junk is and that it is a great concern around the globe  for example in the article it stated that microdebris fields are so small that they cannot be detected and if it hits a spacecraft it can be damaged  the author also states that if space agencies help then maybe space pollution will decrease
the author organizes tis artical by starting wih history and what is space junk then continues on explaining how junk gets smaller also how small it is and the problem if poses
hahaha this school expects me to do this lol how funny dumb school
space junk is basiclly like littering satelites are trying to connect to these problems by reducing so much space junk even the military and nasa were trying to find out the whole situation the aurthor trying to tell the reader that space junk could lead to many problems to the universe the only way they can do that is to reduce many space junk to decrease less astroids taking over the universe
tey lay it out from what what is space junk which expalins what is space junk then crash course expalins how space junk is deadly when passed and can run riskand lastly how does effect a spacecraft when space junk is passed and how it must bemade stronger
the author tells us about the many things that have happened in up in space and haow to prevent everythimg
he goes from being funny to serious he says that space junk is a serious matter he goes into the past and current with details to prove that space junk is very dangerous and has become a problem
the author organizes this article by sections  the sections are in order of importance and definition the author wants you to understand what space junk is before you read more about it and the author wants the reader to have a complete understanding of where it comes from and what it is

facts
the author organizes the article by seperating different topics into different sections for example when the author wants to inform readers about what space junk actually is the author titles that section what is space junk

the author puts the article by putting the information in separate categories by doing this they can give more details about the specifics of space junk
the article is organized in a way that helps the reader understand more and more about the topic as the information is presented  the author starts off by stating the topic and summarizing the rest of the article ths second paragraph explains what created the problem the third paragraph shares what the problem has already caused in the recent years finally the last paragraph addresses the problem one last time explaining why it is so serious the author also tries to give some solutions but ends with an optimistic thought that corporations and nations will hopefully come up with a solution soon

the author organizes the article into three condenced topics about orbitting junk the three topics are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal the author provides facts and opinions in each subtopic to enlighten  the reader about space
at first the author gives a little bit of backround on what is sent up to space and all the varitety of objects that are sent then he or she starts to explain how the objects have an effect on space and the dangers it comes with the author also organizes it by the titles of the paragraphs

they have specific facts and little details in certian catagories of his paper
first he captures your interest with his rhetorical question its atool bag then he gives the reader historical information leading up to our present time
first the author presents the problem space junk next he explains what space junk is after that he explains how space junk is created which is by freeorbiting satellites crashing into each other finally he explains what organizations like nasa and esa are doing to solve the problem the subparagraphs give it away such as what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
thw author organizes this article very well he started with explaining what everything was and then went on too explain what it was and how we can maybe stop it from happening
he goes step by steps he tells us what each thing is like and it really helps out alot
the author splits the artical up into sections each section describing different subjects the author decribes what space junk is then how it gets there and finaly how it can effect the safety of our astonats and space ships
the author organizes this artile by beginning with information about the history of satellites and space junk in paragraph five the sentence begins with the statement over the past 52 years this is stating that explaing the history of spacecrafts the next topic is of crashes dead satellites in the past and how the crash effects the future the next topic is of how scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution in this topic it also explains how the problem still exsists this article is very well oranized
the author has organized the article by using headers and titles to sort the information for example the header stating what is space junk has all the information about how space junk has gotten into our atmosphere and what it is the header stating crash course has the information about what happens when two satellites collide
the author organizes the article in a simple way the author gives you thanking at first than using statistics and makes you thank bout what is gonna happen to all that space junk

the author begins his article with an attentiongrabbing introduction with the shocking exclamations then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of space junk from this he begins explaining exactly what space junk is and when it first appeared in the atmosphere above space after that he gives a past event from february 2009 and in 2008 as examples of how space junk occurs next he describes the severity of these space crashes by using details such as comparing grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall  this comparison was used very well because it helps create an image of how bad it is when two satelites in space collide finally the author closes his article by telling the reader how big of a problem space junk is becoming and how space agencies are beginning to work together to put a stop to it
the author starts off with telling us what space junk is then he tells us about history and how two satellites crashed into each otherand last but not least he tells us about microdebris          who cares about space dustno one controls dead satellites disabled objects in space becomes pieces of hightech junk
the authors tone is a big attention grabber at the beginning as the story goes on the details increase and get deeper

he organizes it into different storys with different titles
i believe is in chronological order according to years in the very section after the introduction it says in 1957 after that it gradually progresses to present day the author also would explain the major problems in the past and work his way up to explaining our modern day problems for example the author talked about space junk in 1957 and later in the article about satellites crashing into one another in 2009
the author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say  if he didnt conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about orbiting junk and crash course  the two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections
that there is too much junk up in space and the more and more they get is just going to make everything go wrong and soon everything will start to crash
the author puts the story in different sections for example one section is what is space junk and the next section is crash course
at first the author brings you in with starting sentence after that he explains how serious space junk really is then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries     but the last and maybe most important thing is the microdebris fields the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball while people may thing a baseball is small and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger
the author starts out with an introduction paragraph that was written in a way to grab the readers attention and get them to keep reading its written in an almost comical way by using a phrase that many people have heard before which is the first sentence in reference to the famous superman line then it goes on to paragraph to that is used to explain to the reader just what the rest of the article is going to be about and give a little background information on it it gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 67 titledcrash course it explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites the risks and dangers are further explained in little bits but a big deal this part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal it can still cause a lot of damage it gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage it concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem
the author first defines what satelittes and space crafts are and why they are launched into space then explains how the microdebri effect them the author backs it up with detail and specific information and findings
the organize them in a way that grabs the authors attention each time about each subjest of space junkit is in order by the least dangerous to the most dangerous thing just by the last title little bits but a big deal
the author first starts off by telling what the problem is the problem is space junk the author explains exactly what this junk is the author then gives a history of space exploration i think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up the important thing is they realize its a problem that is explained in the last section theyre trying to find ways to solve this problem
the author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first by doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place after that they tell you about the crash course in that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another then after they tell you about that they tell you how unsafe little bits are within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space
the author organizes this article by title names for each topic in the article to break down each topic so it is easier to read
he organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics like what is space junk this paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space crash course this paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space little bits but a big deal this talks about how little thing that get lost in space like tools from astronauts get lost in space and which can cause a lot of damage
the author starts his article with a joke then it turns to serious the author moves to the dates to satellite crashes and other dates of space on the last section the author talks about how space junk is dangerous and why we need to stop sending excess substances into outerspace
he organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way
the author begins the article with strange sentences to gain the attention of the reader  then the author begins inform the reader of the dangers of debris in space first by giving a brief history of space exploration  the article is then divided into sections which talk about different types of debris such as satellites and small bits of space trash  in each section the author describes the danger of each  the article ends by the author describing efforts being made by nasa and the european space agency to maintain catalouges of space debris and to help reduce space debris
people think that space is junk and noone like this earth
the author organizes the imformation in this text in a chronological order the author goes from telling about the history of the great invasion to the present and how the debri from even way back then could be effecting astronauts and satelittes of today
scitentists are hard pressed for an easy soulution to the problem of space junkand both national aeronautics and space agencynasa
from the least dangerous to the most dangerous things of space junk
he puts everything in order like you should and he puts the smaller paragraphs toward the beginning of this article
the author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly space junk is and how it can affect us an example would bewhat happens when a satellite dies or malfuunctions and cant be repaired of course the answer to that its disbaled and becomes a piece of hightech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit the second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite from paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one american and one russian both traveling more than 20000 mph crashed into each other 491 mi above the earth the main purpose of the next and final part of this authors article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement if you find that hard to believe compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall all in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising
the article is a well organized piece it starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that space junk is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more peoples attention it then goes in to defining what space junk is as well as the great space invasion in the third section it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space finally in the last section it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about it also presents a solution
the author starts out the article with excitement and makes the reader more interested in this passage  he organized it by starting out with what was seen in the sky that you dont see everyday  hes got different titles which talk about what exactly is in the sky on this earth that we dont normally see such as space junk and what it is  he then goes into talk about how the space junk causes crashes and the harm that it has  then he goes into talking about how even if its little particles that arent very big can still cause serious damage due to the the speed of the spacecraft and what it runs into
the author basically organize it from the timeline of special events it started off with fun facts then it talked about alot of facts
the author organizes the article in sections of information each paragraph is describing itself
the author organizes the article by first providing an exciting introduction about space junk then follows it by explaining what space junk is is the section titled what is space junk after that the author tells of a specific event in february 2009 that gives the reader of an event that actually happened not of one that could or might happen after that section which was called crash course the author goes onto the next section which was named little bits but a big deal this section tells the reader in detail or how dangerous space junk can be it also explains that nasa and the european space agency are trying to come up and with an easy solution after that the author finishes up but without a specific conclusion
he puts it all so that he ceches you with a hook then he tell you some history then he goes right into the importance of the articol and tells you about space junke
the first thing that the author does is tell you about the first satelite launched into space then over the years more satelites were launched the author is telling you the causes of the space debri next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things the last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be the author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous during the last paragraph the author tells the reader that the problem is never ending and ways that corporations could come together to help this problem
the author organize this article by seprate titles for each section each section is about a little different thing so it has indvidual titles so you know what the section is going to be about and so you know its different from the last section you just read
the author has different titles for each different the article is about and the titles go with what the author is talking about instead of putting it all in one big article
by tittleing it in sections keeping it organized

frist the author starts with  a bit of a back story on space flight then goes on to what has been up there over the past 52 years and what can happen to them and what space junk is      then he goes on to what will happen with nobody controlling the malfuctioning satellites like a collison which is not good it creates at problem of debris then he goes on to state that even an object like a tool bag can be a free orbit satellites in crash course      finally he goes on to saying about how big this issue is and how much damage it can cause and how the goverments of the world are trying to correct there mistake and how commerical space travel is making the problem worse which is in  little bits but a big deal
this article is broke in groups with headings the headings are the main idea of the section

the author first explains to us what space junk is consisted of  the paragrapghs explain where the debris comes froms and how it got to be there  the next section of the text tells how the debris crashes into each other  the author gives an example of when one american and russian satellites ran into each other  no matter the size of the debris the speed can cause serious damage  the conclusion says that space junk is increasing because of more exploration
the author breaks the overall article into sections that introduce the problems give statistics and give information on the debris itself the three main sections are titled what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs this allows the reader to always know whats going on and somewhat outlines the entire article
the author grabs the readers attention in the beggining with the phrase grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor  after the attention getter paragraph the author gives background history over the subject in what is space junk  with the new information over the history the author gives an example of satellites crashing cause alot of space junk     then the author explains why the junk is so dangerous by saying tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on spacecraft  then the author says the the problem of space trash is increasing due to commercial space travel  the author purpose to raise awareness over our space travels and its consequences
the author organizes all the details by date
the author of this article starts with getting you intrested in what he has to say he first gives some history on waht space junk is in the section what is  space junk then the author tells about the dangers that space junk has on us like with how the satellites crash together he talks about what the big fuss is with the space junk and how it is increasing
he starts off by saying stuf about space and stuuf then he started talking about space junk and its history and how its dangorous

he organizes it by putting into sections of introduction what does it do and how it happens what is space junk crash course little bits but a bing deal
tha author organizes the article by puting subtitles in the article to seperate diferent topics of space junk
the article is divided into an introduction and sub titles called what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal each containing body paragraphs it ends in a conclussion paragraph

the author starts off telling you what space junk is space junk is the unused or broken satellites in space and other smaller things then the author tells you about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other dead satellites colliding has happened before lastly the author talks about how little bits of satellite pieces are a big deal smaller satellite pieces go faster and therefor can crash into other satellites and destroy them very easily she organizes her article by order of importance
the author organizes the article in some what of a chart telling what space junk is and then the course that it is on and last but not least what little bits but big deals like what would happen if this little piece of space junk came flying at us and then tore a huge hole in the side of our space craft
in this article the author origanizes it by indroducing an important topic with something catchy that will pull the reader in his sentence that states look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor its a tool bag introduces the paragraph well by catching the readers attention with a phrase that you have heard before only with different word then the author after he has you attention goes into statitics which makes you believe that the author knows what he or she is talking about it gives a certain creditiblity he aslo compares it to things that make it easy to relate to however he sticks to getting the point across
he breaks it down into different topics the first main sectiontitled what is space junk is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris crash course is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause little bits but a big deal is about how tiny bits of debris may seem harmless but they can still do damage
by placing examples of the things that have been lost at space and what they some timew do like two bad satalites crashing into each other  then going to what needs to happen
the author first states his opinion and the reasons behind it then they give the reader some details ad facts to back up his observation they gave examples of past experiences involving cluttered space the rest of the article is information and examples surrounding the problem
the author organizes the article to show what space junk is and the dangers of it
he want to anyone knows about the space junk this is a first artificial satellite og the usthe author organize the article first he explain what is a junk and what function have how many kinds of junk we have on the space and he said too the variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and the satellites have been sent beyond earths atmosphere he talk about the dead satellites run the risk of colling with each other and any objects released in to space become free orbiting satellites and how  the scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk
yet the problem is certain to persist
the author organizes the article in a logical order he grabs your attention and then tells you the facts he then tells history and why space debris is a problem
the author organizes the articles by starting off with a little humor then going into details such as explaing what space junk is and going into details about it his tone changes to inform the readers on how important and dangerous this is
the author organizes the article by seperating it and breaking it into sectionslike orbiting junk talks explains what space junk is then tells the reader it is a great concern to the government of space agencies around the globe then theres what is space junkwhich explains whats happen over the past 52 years then  crash course tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother then the reader goes to  little bits but a big deal which explains how bits of space debris present a very serious problem how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the carefully designed spacecraft the articel being organized  helps the reader stay interested and understand better
organizes it good

he makes it organized by telling the reader information they will need to read the next section
the author organizes the article by topic in the first section what is space junk the author basically explains what space junk is and gives a few examples of space junk the author talks about satellite crashes and the results of them in the second section in the last section the author explains how even though some debris is very small it still poses a huge problem
the author organizes this article with everything going in order of how the space stuff got there it talks about how it is bad for space and it sholdnt be there then it finishes with talking about how everything above it all affects us
the author supporting details uses what is space junk and others to describe what he or she is talking about
the author organizes the article by the importance of the textfor one the first paragraph what is space junkis a pretty serious matterthen after that text is still important but the way the article is set upis like the paragraphs are organized based on the importance of the information in them
the author orginizes the article by titles so that the reader could look for specifice information on the subject of there choice
he asks questions in the beginning he goes into a history lesson and then he closes with a thought that there needs to be a solution
he starts with the begining middle and to end duh

to organize the article the author breaks up the information into different categories they have the introduction then they have a section about space junk after that there is a section about how the satelites crash and lastly there is a section about how much of an impact the space junk has on people in space and on earth
the author organizes the article by matter of importence
the article has different segments in it with different information all the articles talk about microdebris so the whole article is talking about the samething in different segments
the author organizes the article in a fair manner he explains how the space junk is really a serious matter he states how some people might not care about this space junk but theyre are a great amount of people who care about what is exposed to outside of the earth not only is that junk but it is things to give us and nasa information it also gives a good example of how the junk is released which they created a paragraph crash course the paragraph little bits but a big deal also explains how people don care about this junk
the author organizes the article by giving each new subject a title
the author organizes the article by the different topics she wants to cover the first topic is all about space junk while the second is all about the crash course and the third is about little the space trash
he starts out telling what space junk is then he goes and tells how satellites crash and make tiny debris after that he talks about how the little debris can be a bid deal he organizes it all by using the headings what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author organizes this article in a particular order that it all ties together he or she begins with a creative introduction to engage the reader then proceeds to lead right into the main idea space junk he mentions the objects that have been sent into eaths atmosphere and branches off the problem of satellites and what happens when it malfunctions he concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk this leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that dead satellites cause and so on the author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage
he arranges the article into seperate topics by title  the main subject of the sections are used in the title to give the reader an idea of what the purpose of that section is  he does not clutter alot of different topics together yet he organizes them to help understand how space junk poses a problem to spaceships and satellites
the author organizes this article by grouping different information together under what is space junk an explanation is given of what it is under crash course the author talks about examples of when space debris has become a problem to space exploration
the author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way they first describe what space junk is in what is space junk they do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can die and hurtle uncontrolably through space then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section crash course they explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the earth at incredible speeds they also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth in the final section little bits big deal the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed the author provides startling evidence that microdebris can puch holes in spacecraft to inform the reader on the dangers of space junk
the author divides the article into different sections to make it easier to read and to organize the topics
the author starts their introduction by making a fun eye catching statement then they put in a historical time in their article the author decided to divide the article into sections to make it easier and more organized to undertstand
the author organize this
the author organizes the article by breaking up the information into seperate headings and paragraphs  this helps myself and other readers to understand the information better without getting bored
the author organizes the artical from history to present he she lists things for the matters they are in like say crash course they explain that the satilites crash from the course they are on then say what is space junk they tell you what space junk is and how it happend way back when the person lets you know what the sections are about
the author supports this article by giving a good and stronge reason and in diffrent areas to help and break down the problem in a simple way such as puting it in diffrent forms of phragraphs so that the read can better understand what the author is tring to tell the readers reading this although it is very long it toke a very complicated matter and put it into a simple form fo readers that are at a young age to fully understane the importance in space junk
it is organized into sections on the junk in outer space  they are telling you that it can be a very dangerous matter  each section is about different things  space trash is still increasing these days  without anyone at the controls dead satellites could collide with each other
the author does ok the authors reference to the tool bag in the first paragraph isnt talked about again untill about two paragraphs later i as the reader had no clue what the author meant by tool bag untill the end of the second topic
the author of this article starts with an introduction that states once clear space is now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions the author then goes on to explain precisely what space junk is and how it has formed in the seciton entitled what is space junk the next section entitled crash course goes on to explain the harm that space debris can cause to spacecraft little bits but a big deal concludes the article by telling why we should care about space debris the section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris
he explains it when gives examples of things that have gotten lose in space
the author organizes the article from most important to the least important  the author goes form what is space junk to crash course and finally to little bits but a big deal  he goes this way because to understand what the reader is talking about you must first understand what space junk is and to understand why is it important you have to know how dangerous space junk is by knowing that the space junk has crashed into and destroyed many spaceships
howdoestheauthororganizethearticalesupportyourresponsewith detailsfromthearticlepleasetypeyouranswerintheboxbelow
the author organizes the article in different ways such as what is space junk talks about all of the different things that do get sent out and lost or dies crash course talks about how the dead satellites run into eachotheralso little bits but its a big deal explains that even though they can be little bitty pieces of the space junk they do matter
the author organizes the article by talking about the junk that is orbiting space now then explaning space junk to people who dont know what it is and then after that explaining the harm and or problems that the junk could have on earth and even the people who travel out to space
the author organized this article with a attention getter and than some starlting facts after the fact you have been pulled in than the author gives some really startling facts that are really interesting the author informs you how far away the junk is and how fast it can come back to earth and do some serious damage
the author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine it includes headings with short paragraghes under them the point of the article is made very clear in a short amount of space with many imperative facts and details they make it interesting by giving each heading an apealing name such as crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author breaks up the artical into three different parts he does that so that you can understand what the artical is talking about if he mixed it all into one many people would be very confused so he simplifies it so that the already hard topic he is bringing forward is much easier to understand by the people reading the aritical
the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article  the author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earths atmosphere  then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk now instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space
he gets the tittle on what he want to wright about then he goes and tittles the story haedings
i would say that the author organized this passage in a way of most important and which came first in the passage what is space junk it talks about how satelites began and the last passage little bits but a big deal
the author organizes this article great he drew me in by the introdtuction the author also had very good detail on space junk and he had had an excellent body the author really did a great job on organizing his article
the author organizes this article in a very unique way in the introduction he grabs your attention by stating  grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor by saying that the author has automatically grabbed your attention and you are now hooked in on reading the article then the author writes a series of important facts that can be useful for you to know
by puting the stories in the right order on how it would happen first
he organizes the article with telling us what spacejunk is what it does and how its dangerous
he gives lots of information throughout the article
the author organizes the article by building up information he starts off with how it all started by explaining what space junk is then he tells us how sattelites will eventually crash into each other finally he axplains how the results of those crashes will create debris that can cause a big problem with the earth
the author organizes this article in three different sections they start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about space junk then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize it is very effective
the author organizes this article by events that lead up to what his main topic is he starts with the first artificial satellite and end with all the space trash in outer space now
the author organizes the article by first grabbing our attention in an artful playful manner lines 12 the author then goes on to explain how space junk is created although in a much more serious manner once the reader is clear on the causes of space junk the author goes indepth on what happens to these unwanted fragments in the way of collissions and freeorbiting satellites eventually the author concludes how these little pieces of space trash become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel and advises that we seek a viable sollution
the author explains a story first for an example then he goes to his point he tells wat space junk is then he tells why it is harfull even if we think it is not he does this when he talks about stuff hitting each other in there orbit and when a simple toolbag could cause a problem
first the author tills you what the article is all about then the author tills you the dangers of it
the author starts out interseting  then they give us statistics about what has happened in the past years  around the sixth paragraph they give us examples  by the eighth and ninth paragraphs they are talking about the bag which was mentioned in the introduction  the conclusion of this passage is saying that they hope to one day come up with a sollution to this
the just use thing they know and but things where they belong like what is space junk it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements they always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under they never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under what is space junk it just dosent fit they only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about
it begins with a humorous statement meant to entertain the reader and lead him or her inot the next paragraph which tells the reader what the passage is going to be about the next heading defines the subject and how it gets there the next two paragraphs give specific examples of encounters with the subject then it explains why we should care about this subject
because it gives you a lead in what happenend or what it that
the auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
in sections so if you are looking for a specific answer to a question you just look under the topic it may be under
the article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite and how the united states followed along behind them next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other functioning satellites and even space ships in the last section little bits but a big deal you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous for example even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts the overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history give you examples and detail problems that space junk can cause
he organize it in diffrent topics in the story like one topic is orbiting junk and the next one is what space is so he switchis off on diffrent topics witch i think keeps you more intested in the story cause theres diffrent topics
by telling what each topic is talking about and how those topics explain all the things about space
the author  believes that there needs to be less material in space eventualy they will all break down and fall into the earths atmosphere poluting it
he begins with shocking statments to get the reader interested then he begins with the history behind all spacecrafts and how they were created and what purpose they were used for
the article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope  then it gives a brief history of space exploration and a couple incidents of space debris including the 2009 satellite crash and the toolbag  it then comes out and tells you how big of a problem things from a toolbag to destroyed satellites by telling you about a sandblaster and how it works and using it as a larger scale for objects in orbit
he tells people how their is junk from the satelites hitting each other and that their is junk every where in the orbits
the author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections the first section is called orbiting junk the second is called what is space junk the third is called crash course the fourth is called little bits but a big deal they break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article so its not all in one combination
he organizes the article by what happened in the past first and then talks about what is going to happened or what could happen
the author organized his writing by sectioning his writing off
he starts out as describing space junk than he goes to crash course and tells the reader if something extremely bad happens this is the approch than last he talks about space trash he describes the outter space with all of the trash floating around in it from previous astronotes      he goes into great detail about everything that he talks about but also its not drawn out to where you fall asleep reading it the author did a really good job of writing this article
the author organizes the article by seperating the facts of everything  the facts that he talked about include the clutter in space and when they launched the first artificial satellite and space junk got started and who is going to take responsibility for the space trash
the author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created it also presents some of the problems caused by space junk the second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring the final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships and how ships cannot avoid it easily the article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk
the first paragraph is to get the readers attention and make them want to read the story then the tone changes in the section what is space junk and because more serious this section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it     the next section is called crash course and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide and it gives example of this happening in february 2009 with two communication satellites     section little bits but a big deal is the last section and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter the section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts and our space crafts that we send into space the last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing and is still a problem all nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem
the author organizes the article by the development of space technology and the dates in which the statistics of space junk staelites telescopes and ect are reconized
the author uses titles before it opens up new information for example one of the titles is orbiting junk after that the author explains with information
the author first used a hook to catch the readers attention by using a question then he explained what space junk was how satellites can crash into each other how space debris is a big deal how space debris is harmful and how they are trying to come up with a solution for it
the author organizes the article by giving you information about the junk and a time when an actual space invasion occured then the article goes into how people might think its not a big deal but it is
the author organized the article by separating information into several different sections first heshe explained what space debris is in what is space junk secondly heshe used an example of the negative effects that space debris has caused to space in  crash coursethen finally they use information from space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on earth in little bits but a big deal
it was not organized well
my opinion of this article is that it is well organized and well written why i say that is because it grabbed my atttention expecially in the introduction as i followed along and continued to read the facts and concerns of this article made me want to read it
the author oraginizes the article in varies ways he first gets our attention by using questions and loud statements to get our attnetion then he shows us the harm in space junk and gives us facts about the way we are taking care of the atmosphere then he leads us to the end where he tells us what we can do to avooid harmful situations and gives us tips on how to improve our wasteful tendencies
the author organizes the article by first informing the reader about the topic of space junk history is used to give an accurate example of space junk after some background information is given the author uses statistics and facts to show the reader how dangerous space junk can be lastly the author ties up the last paragraph emphasizing the damage space junk can do and what a threat it can be in the future the author end the article with a concerned tone and uses the organization of the article to fully inform the reader
the other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention then is gives a brief history entitled what is space junk after that secton it moves onto  a more recent accident with space junk and finishes the article off with the dangers of the little debri
the author of orbiting junk organizes his article into several subtopics so that the reader can clearly see the change of subjects in the article making it easier to read the subtopic what is space junk talks about and defines what space junk really is while little bits but a big deal talks about the relavence of space junk and its effect on space travel
he grabs your attention with a little action then he explains what space junk is and it can damage space things how little things make a big deal
the author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily without much confusion before heshe goes on to inform you about the trouble space junk is causing they inform you what space junk is then they inform you of some of the things that are happening because of space junk as in satellites crashing together and they conclude by telling how big of a problem space junk has been and will be because the amount of space trash is actually increasing
the author organizes it into different subsections based of what the subject of the section is
first the author talks about space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched then the author talks about how this space junk is currently of great concern to the government agencies
the author puts this article in a weird way he or she starts by a eye catching introduction and then goes to a boring history lesson about satelittes and space junk then the author takes us into another exciting paragraph about satelittes crashing into each other and it just goes on and on until the article is over but somehow at the end of it all i still wanted to know more
at first the author uses a suprising statement to grab the readers attention and bring them into the article itself     next the author discusses the seriousness of space junk circling our planet     the author than defines what space junk is and than gives a brief history on where space junk came from      the author than talks about the dangers of space junk colliding with other objects such as functional sattalites and human being who are workign outside of their spacecraft     finally the author talks about how dangerous even the smallest pieces of space debris can be extremely harmful and how scientists and entire nation are working together to solve the problem of space junk
the author organizes the article but making side headings of the more important things about space and space junk and orginizing information to go into those areas
the organization of the article is information in each section while collectively the sections map out a situation that could cause space junk the introduction which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by what is space junk immediately afterword before defining space junk a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced the idea of an object malfunctioning is given and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning crash course provides an example from february 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section little bits but a big deal the small pieces of debris or the example given in crash course of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying     tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft this section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful the organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear yet nondescript situational plot
the author organizes the artical but putting stictics in first before try to persuade the readres what really happen i think it is really good becuase people need to know the true facts
the author seperates the article into different sections that have information that goes along with cooresponding information in each of the sections for example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009 in the section it first tells the reader what could possibly happen and then gives an example or a possible scenarioin another example the author titles a section what is space junk the author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside earths atmosphere then the author describes what the kinds of junk are found in space from these previous space missions
the author organized this to where he could draw attention to the passage starting with the rehtorical questions then describing space junk telling the reader how it got there and what peoples reaction is to the space junk
the author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled orbiting junk that is used to introduce the subject the author then uses two sections to explain what space junk is and why it is such a big danger he then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled little bits but a big deal which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful
the introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it what is space junk describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space crash course tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the earths orbit it also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris its any object little bits but a big deal tell about how much people truly care about whats going on in space it also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided

the author organizes the article by arranging it in order of cause and effect  the author starts off by drawing the reader in with an introduction explaining what he or she is talking about what exactley space junk does and how it effects us all  this method was executed very well by the author
he tells about the dangers and how it all began it is written in oreder form the past to present which help you understand better
the author organizes the article in a very lovely easy to read way first he starts it off with a nice introduction of wondering what could possibly be up in that sky of ours and then we find out its just a tool bag then he informs us that there is space junk floating in orbit around our planet he then lets the reader become familiar with what space junk is and how it gets there next he explains how satellites can randomly crash into each other which explains all of the space junk floating around sort of like the climax of the article the last thing he states is that though the particles may be small that they are orbiting at such great speeds that even though they are so small they still can create much damage
the author  starts out the article with an introduction to grab the readers attention by saying a simalar quote that was used in super man  after this he explains what space junk is and the diffrent types and how it gets there  next he tells about examples on how more space junk is created like the dead satellites colliding or human error like letting go of a tool bag  finnaly he tells about the dangers and harmful effects of space debris  an example he uses to show the danger of micro debris is showing the difference of sand and then sand in a sand blaster and it being able to knock of paint
the author tells where the space junk came from what it is and how harmful it is he told us about the crashes and where the rockets go
the author begin the article by identifing what space junk is then by presenting his veiw of it and how it is harmful to earths surface

the author organizes this article by starting off with background information to saying what can happen if the space junk does collide with another sattelite to saying how space debri is a huge threat and can create a huge problem
at first he describes what the matter is then talks about how that things that are still in orbit that are non useful are in the way and then describes how all that stuff can cause damage to the spacecraft that is launched
the arthor organize the piece by getting more serious as it goes on starts off with the introduction then give history then tell about the collisions and tells how it harmfull
the author organized the article by giving an introduction with personal anecdotes the author then follows with three other sections that contain important information and facts about space junk

the auther arganized the article be tiling you how the things got in spase and thin gives the problem that they have or might couse
the author organizes the article by staring out with startling statements about space junk and then giving information about space and our travels to space then the author talks about the problems with space travel the the author talks about the things that happen while in space and what happens to the austronauts that go up into space
the author organized the article by the way the sections go with each other what is space junk can be connected to crash course because the tiny things that float above the atmosphere can be considered space junk and can still be on a crash course of something little bits but a big deal can be connected to both other sections because they all have to do with the dangers of small or large objects floating through space and becoming a danger to the spacecraft and the astronauts on or in the spacecraft
the author organizes this article in different sections full of information he informs us on the harmful effects of space junk and also provides information about the past involving space exploration and how this space junk has found itself beyond earths atmosphere
the author organizes the article into multiple sections based on subtopic there is the introduction then what is space junk a section about the origin and nature of space junk then there is crash course a section about sattelite collisions creating microdebris and finally little bits but a big deal about the effects of space junk
the author organizs the information in the way that helps us to understand the information better and still get the point across when he uses titles that are very explaintory it shows us in a good way
the author has a subtitle that says what is space junk then the author gets to the point of their topic
the author organizes his paragraphs in specific sections first he has an introduction which capture the readers attention then he wrote what is space junk which is a section that gives a history of space travel after that is the crash course which explains the crashing of satellites into debris finally is the little bits big deal and this is a section about the imporatnce of what he wrote about
the author puts everything in order from lift off to the ending of the space craft
the author starts with a flashy introduction to grab the readers attention  the reader then goes on to describe the definition of space junk in the section what is space junk  he describes what constitutes space junk in this section of the article  the author then informs the reader that space junk can collide and provide danger to the people on earth as well  he describes this in crash course  he describes microdebris in little bits but a big deal  he finally concludes in a pessimistic manner stating that space junk is actually increasing
the author in my opion did organize it well because he has dates showing when something happened and the author stays on topic with each paragraph that was written
well i hink with how she set up her information on space travel and on how harmful microdebris really is
the author organizes this article as if he is very serious about the matter and wants to put all the concerns about space junk in the story
the author uses many different styles of writing one of them includes his organization      the author uses a different style of organization than other authors he doesnt write in chronological order he mostly organizes from whats least important to the very important information the author starts with a shocking statement then goes on to explain his statements and tell his readers what space junk is he then talks about the effect space junk can have on other objects in space and in the end he really starts to talk about what people think about space junk and how dangerous it is     the author starts with little information he is defining what space junk is and then the author gradually starts talking about what space junk does and its importance
he organizes it by putting what has to be with what in each catorgorie
the author organizes the the article by strting the article with an eyeopener grab your telescope look up in the sky  its a comet its a meteor     its a    tool bag      the next thing the author does is explain the
the article starts out in a comical tone to get the readers attention and to make the article seem more interesing      it later goes on to provide specific facts and details about the seriousness and danger ofspace junk he provides facts about past space exploration projects and satellites that have crashed into each other while moving at high speeds creating a large amount of  tiny microdebris using such facts he tries to get the reader to see the seriousness in the matter of space junk      in his conclusion he states that the amount of space trash is on the rise because more countries have undertaken space exploration
the author organized the article by catching our attion by haveing a startling fact about things up in space  then he gave us the background of things that happened in space that had to do with space junk  after that he talks about the speed of junk and how harmful it really is to our planet if they crash then finally he talks about how big of an impact outter space junk has on our saftey here on earth
the author combines there the story into sections the introduction is used to grasp the reader the next section defines what space junk is the next section gives examples of it happening the last section refers to it being a big deal
he starts out with a hook to get the readers attention about the paragraph using several different sentences he then states the general idea of the whole paragraph which is that many people are concerned about space junk he then goes on  to explain exactly what space junk is in the next section in the following section he explains how many pieces of small debris are created when satellites crash into each other or when astronauts accidentally lose a tool bag he then goes on to tell about what harmful effects space junk can have he then concludes the article by stating his first idea again and stating that many organizations are trying to do something about the problem
the author organizes this peice into different sections to help the reader better understand the importance of space debris for example the author separates the passage into four different sections with titles at the begining to help the reader better understand it
the author organizes the article in a very logical way one that is the order a person would think when told the problem the author starts out with a hook that is a reference to a very well known line which then makes the reader want to read more and find out what the author is talking about the next thing that the author does is introduce the topic and explain what it is then the problem is stated along with the reasons why it is a problem and what caused it
the author organizes the article by importance the author tells you about space junk what it is how it got there and how we can help
the author organizes it from the beginning of the problem then gets to how we can solve the problem it starts with giving history of when humans first made it to space secondly it tells how we have traveled through space lastly it explains how we could solve the problem of space junk
first the author gives a good agsattention grabbing statement then the authour talks about how orbital pathways are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions next the author state hisher thesis statement also heshe explain to us what is space junk and give us facts about his topic then heshe have headlines and explain to us what that headline means
the author organizes the article by giving very realistic details and by explaining things more clear by providing evidence in his story
the author organizes the article by introducing the topic giving an example of when it could occur and exlpaining the effects of the situation the first section just explains the topic of the article the second section gives and example of when space junk was formed and what happened the third sections just explains what happens when space junk is formed and how is effects different things in the universe
he organizes the article by subject for example crash course describes the collision of an american and russian satellite and a toolbag lost in space and what is space junk describes how debris from satellites in space is created
throughout the article you come across many titiles this is a way to break each topic down to become more specfic with each title the author has a cathy pharse to go with it so at frist glance you think that the topic in minor or unimportant but you are wrong the author organized it from his to recents occurences so show that it has been a problem for some tinme now
the junk in space is very harmful to earths surface because if a metorite comes and crashes into earth that is becuse of all the trash in space
the tool bags are the bast way to do it in space
the author organizes the article by putting the topics about the paragraphs
the author organizes the article by letting you know what they are talking about but without giving details than they give a paragraph titles what is space junk they than tell you what they are talking about in detail after you find out what space junk is than they tell you stories of actual events that have happened in our space with the title little bits but a big dealin part of the article is letting you know just because something is small and harmless when you get that going the speed of five miles per second than you can cause some serious damage
the author organizes it chronologically then factually it begins talking about space travel in 1957 then talks about more spance exploration in 2009 afterwards the article talks microbedris and more about broken satillites
the author breaks the article into four sections  the first section is the introduction  in this section the author gives the audience a brief idea of what the article is about also drawing the reader in with grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor its a    tool bag  in the next section what is space junk the author tells the audience about how space exploration started and the various objects that have been realeased into our solar system that are considered space junk  in the next section crash course the author describes how old satelittes that are no longer being controlled can crash into each other and create microdebris  in the last section little bits but a big deal the author explains how this microdebris travels ar high speeds and can still do damage to space ships and astronauts even though the microdebris is very little using this method the author is able to explain the harms of space junk to the audience in the simplest method
the author organizes the ariticle by using bold faced headers at the beginging of the different sections the headers are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
the author basically organizes this article into four main sections first there is the introduction next is a little bit of history on how these things form after that it talks about the negative affects these pieces of debris can have lastly it talks about what organizations are doing to try and clean up this space mess
the author first opens with an introduction that grabs your attention  he then explains how since the start of space exploration years ago debris has been caught in space orbits from events such as rocket launchings and satellite collisions  he talks about different ways that it can make it into orbits and also the size of the debris and the speed at which it travels  he then heavily emphassizes the importance and seriousness of the matter talking about how dangerous the fragments can be  he concludes with the belief that enough public concern for the buildup of space trash will cause space agencies to begin looking for a solution
he first explains what space junk is and where it comes from then he tells you more facts about it
he tells what space junk does then he gives examples to explain
the author organizes the article with first giving us an intresting statement and then introduces the term space junk next the author explains just what space junk is and the harmful effects it can have the author then backs his claim by giving examples from history of previous satellites and other objects that have posed danger to astronauts then the author closes with explaining that any size of space junk is a potential danger and lists a few more examples from the past that have occoured and what is being done to help the effort
the author breaks it down into three small sections making it easier to understand
they start out by grabing your attention with having you get active by looking in the the sky to see maybe a comet then after that they say its a tool bag this then kinda has your mind wondering why is there a tool bag out there and how did it get out there after that they proceed to tell you about all the stuff that can be put into space that can be very harmful
the author organizes the article by dividing it into individually subtitled sections they began by introducing the topic them gave information and finally concluded the article
the author organizes the article by making interesting headlines for each paragraph by doing this the author has made it easier for the reader to follow along with his story
they start with some history about space travel then go to how its not good to leave space junk in outerspace
the author organizes the article by sections  he or she has an introduction a what is space junk section a crash course section and a little bits but a big deal section  in each section he explains the topic theme of the title in a more clear and better way
this article is organized into secctions or topics with certain things only talked about in each section also in each section it can contain multiple paragraphs although still speaking roughly about the same idea such as in paragraphs 6 and 7 of crash course these paragraphs both talk about dead satelites except paragraph six talks about collisions and paragraph seven talks about the crashes and its effects on the astronauts and their ships
he organizes it by first explaining what space junk is and than going into detail everything that happens to satellites and space crafts if they happen to hit or get hit by space junk
he first tells us about the history of space stellites then it goes to how older satellites have crashed and are now dangerous to astronats and how they can avoid those dangers
the author organizes the article from general to specific as the article progresses the information becomes more specific and more detailed
that space junk is bad
the author organizes the article by first catching your attention with the introduction then the author begins to tell you about some history about sattelites next the author explains that space junk makes a crash course for spacecraft finally the author concludes his or her article by explaining how small debris can cause major damage on spacecraft
the auther organizes this article in an outline form giving his thesis 3 topics what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal and details within the three topics
the author used a few techniques with the organization of this article in the intro paragraph humorous matter was used to grab the readers attention this person also used subtitles for the paragraphs in the article to organize hisher ideas and keep everything in a good flow
it is ni a finse
the author of the article orbiting junk organizes the aticle into subsections based of the specific nature of the information that follows the sunheading for the section what is space junk gives some background information on past space launches but focuses on the debris left behind when the missions fail living so called space junk crash course describes the collisions that can occur in outer space lastly little bits but a big deal describes just how big of a deal the microdebris is in outer space at the speed these particles are moving at they become a hazard to all in their vecinity the used of these subsections allows the reader to better understand and follow the article orbiting junk
he gives good detail
he starts off with a shock and then gose on how space junk began
first the author talks about seeing a tool bag in the sky than the author gives background history of space junk than he or she explains why it is a big deal
tehy start by talkin about space junk and how it got therenext they talk about how satellites could crash to earth and last they talk about even if the junk is small it can still do damage
at first he starts off all excited then he gets serious and tells us the harmful stuff that happens and why it happens and how they are trying to prevent it from happening
he organizes this artice base off the domino effectif one of these events never happened none of these wouldnt happen
the author organize the article by talking to nasa about the space junk
it first starts talking about the atmosphere and satellites and then it talks about space junk then it concludes with a solution
the author organizes the article by breaking the subjects up and talking about only one subject at a time other then talking about all tha subjects at once for instance when the author talked about what is space junk the author labled that section as what is space junk and only talked about space junk in that section
the author organizes the article by simply talking about space and how there are satilte crashes then they tell stories about how satiltes and toolbags are left up there they end this article about how its a big deal and its dangerous
he organizes it by first starting off with a bit of humor in the first couple of paragraphs  but by paragraph 4 the author begins to take a more serious and informative role  he starts of by defining space junk then leads into the cause of space junk by telling the main cause of it satellite crashes and then finally informs us of the dangers of the pieces left over from these collisions
the  author organizes the articles based on how things are rated another way they are organized is how they interfear with the satalight
the author organizes the article by putting the information into categories

the author organizes the article into different topics to put out specific details that are important the different topics answer questoins instead of having everything run together      in the paragraphs what is space junk it tells you when they launched the first artificial satellite these different topics give you important information and is seperated to make us understand easier
the author organizes the article by putting it into sections explaining each individual statements or facts being collected he tells about space junk and how satelites can react or how it becomes cluttered
the author organizes the article by putting different topics within the article that emphasize on a certain area of relation for examples the section titled what is space junk focuses on the explanation of what space junk actually is and how it is created and the section titled crash course focuses on the crash between a russian and an american satellite in february of 2009 and goes on to explain that satellite crashes are not the only source of space junk
the author organizes the article into sections and topics keeping the article smooth flowing and easy to come back and reread if a reader needs to

the author organizes his article with the typical introduction body conclusion style but he also puts in subtitles  the subtitles help to guide the readers thoughts and keep information simple as they are reading the article
first he uses an introduction to grab the readers attention the pause in the question really does just this then he tells about space junk and what space junk is in the section called what is space junk he then tells about collisions that have happened including the one in february 2009 that he stated finally he ends it up with statements showing that space junk is a big deal and needs to be fixed he gives a comparison about dust in wind with the sandblaster he tells how nasa and others maintain catalogues of known objects he ends with telling that the problem is increasing and needs to be stopped
the author organizes this article by opening it with a attention getter to get the attention of readers then the author goes on and explains what he is talking about they then explain what the causes and effects the problem has he gives an example of the problem to explain his theory of what is does and who it effects and he closes it with a fact to help the reader understand the causes of the problem
the author organizes the article by introducing space junk he does this by telling the history of space junk then he goes on and tells the reader about the risk of space junk then he says how a little piece of sapce junk can be a big deal
the author organizes the writing pretty well he makes it understandable for the readers to read it he outs his writing in cronalogical order
by labeling what he is going to talk about before he talks about it
he tells us about space history for example the race between the americans and the soviet union and the space junk that was put into space  he then tells us about the dangers these pose and the difiiculties of geting ride of them  he finalizes by telling us how this problum is increasing and the hope that the nations will take more mesures to fix the problum
the main point of the article is about orbiting objects but the autor broke it down into three main parts the first part is describing that space junk is parts of orbiting satellites and things that are no longer functioning the second part is to show that it is possible for satellites to collide causing even more space junk the third part is to show how this space junk may not seem like a big deal but it is and people are beginning to increase space exploration to look for answers
they start with the big things that are in space like a variety of spacecreafts and then move to things like microdebris
the author starts by gaining your attention making a questionable statement that urges you to read on he then begins to explain the history of space travel in the section titled what is space junk he then slowly moves on exaplining the dangers of space junk he does it in a polite yet demanding manner showing that it is an important problem he puts it into threee sections to make it easier to explain what space junk is and then explain the problems of it
they orgainize it by explaining what space junk can and will do if you are not cautious about things that can be left up there they also answer any questions that a reader may have at the beginning of each section so you can understand it better
the author organizes the article by introducing new ideas and then explaining them in the first paragraph he  or she introduces the word space junk in the following paragraph the authors explains what space junk is and also tells how these objects circle the globe in an uncontrolled orbit the next section tells how these objects in an uncontrolled orbit are dangerous
the author organizes the article with subtitles he has all the separate information grouped into sections with labels stating what they are about the introduction is more exciting and then what is space junk is more formal
in his introduction he tries to grab the readers attention after that he states the facts about this serious problem next he raps up his story and tries to tell the reader that this problem is getting worse but people are involved to help stop this serious problem
the article organizes the article by facts heshe used certain facts about space junk in a specific order that made sence
the author starts with interesting material to important facts and conclusions
the author puts everything in diffrent catogories and titles every category
he organiszed it very neatly and had plenty of research in his thoery enough to make me understand more about it
the author organizes the article into how the space junk gets into space then how the space junk can be dangerous because at fast speeds it can be very harmful next the author talks about how even though some of the bits are very small that is bad because then they can not be detected on a radar the author the talks about how scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of space junk
the author organizes the article in four different ways first the author starts with extremely exclamitory statements to get you intersted in the first paragraph second the author gives you a history on the great space invasion then the importance of space junk third the author explains crash courses and the magnitude of crashes in space lastely he concludes what he has explained in the first three ways of discription and wraps up the article
on my own opinion i think the author organizes the article well by starting with rhetorical questions and this  gains attention to the reader and also the way he arranges his paragraphs by describing how the great space invasion and continues his article by giving the causes reasons howeffects and conclusion this makes the article organization good and proffesional
the author organizes the article from the introduction which is very enthusiastic to pull in his reader then he gives you a brief history on the matter he is talking about then to the matter itsself finally to how important this matter is to him and our earth
he titles each paragraph the explains in good details on why the junk in space is dangerous it also catches the readers eye and makes them want to read more and more of it
they explore the vast reaches of our solar system monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireles communication possible
in the passage the author uses titles to organize the article the use of titles alows for different materials to be seperated from each other and to group the alike material
the author organizes the article with multiple sections each section describes the problem of space junk a little more to the reader the section titles what is space junk explains that space junk is the debris in spacve that are orbitting earth such as broken space capsules telescopes and satellites the section called crash course explains that sometimes these objects crash into eachother because these objects can be traveling at speeds of more than 20000 miles per hour they break into hundreds of pieces that each assume their own orbitual path the last section called little bits but a big deal describes how big of a problem space junk is because these debris are traveling so quickly they can damage the most carefully designed spacecraft it also tells the reader that the amount of space junk is increasing creating more of a problem
the author organizes this article very well he starts off by getting the readers attention with rhetorical questions then he continues by explaining what space junk is exactly after that he tells the reader what can happen when satellites are sent up to space finally the author finishes by telling the reader how much of an impact this actually has
th author organizes this article into sections each section further explains the issue or gives background information the author gives information on satellities and objects that can get lost in space and the effect it has on space travel
the author organizes the article by telling you what space junk was and the way it occurs
the author does a very good job by organizing his article he starts off in the introduction as a light tone but than gets more serious this draws the reader in and keeps the reader occupies the way the author orders the article occupies the readers mind
the author organizes the article by explaining what space junk is what happens to the junk and last how much damage they can do
the article first explains what space junk is then how it gets there next how dangous it can be and how it can get worse
they explain the importance of space dabris an how it can effect the satellites orbiting the earth the littlest fragment can cause a big problem
first the author introduces what space junk is then next the author tells about two satellites crashing in the section crash course then the author ends with the section little bits but a big deal
the author first organizes the article with the introduction then into the second paragraph describing the details in the introduction paragraph the third gives facts and intresting details to inform people about the severity of space debris
the author organizes the information in a way in which the reader can understand the complex topic first by giving information about the first satellites and objects were sent into space second by giving details about how space junk comes to be
the author organizes the article by different categories such as what is space junk and crash course this makes it easier for the reader to read and identify what they are going to read
well first he gets you in to it by the first paragraph than his tone changes  it is organized preety well they got the paragraph space junk thats a interesting paragraph the aithor trys to bring you in this story
the author organizes this article by starting with an attention grabber that makes you think because at first it makes no since he then goes on to explain it starting with a story about how the problem started to ending with why it is important to fix it
the author organizes the article in a different way the author puts the article in three different sections or chapters
he has titles and then talks about what the title was they also built off each other such as he talks about space junk then some of the ways some of it has gotten to space and what it does up  there
the author organizes the article in a way to help explain the problem of space junk thouroughly and make it easier to understand the author starts by grabbing your attention saying to look at the sky and see a tool bag paragraphs 1 and 2 the author then starts to explain the history of space junk and how the human races great space invasion started it all paragraph 4 next the different things that become space junk are explained by stating how the disabled object becomes a piece of hightech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit paragraph 5 the author also shows the dangers of space junk by saying that bits of space debris present a very serious problem because tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the the most carefully designed spacecraft paragraph 9 finally the author tells how agencies are looking for an easy solution to the problem of space junk this ends the article by emphasizing the importance of this problem
the author organizes the article by different sections  he has a topic then talks about the topic and does not get off subject
it list thing in how they think it should be
he makes he to weree he can under stand how and what junk is and how bad it is
by creating several articles supporting the main idea
the author organizes the article into four sections the first section orbiting junk acts as an introduction that hooks the readers interest making them want to read more about space debris and how it occurs the second section what is space junk goes into detail about what space junk is and how all that waste come to settle into our orbit in the first place the next section crash course explains the dangers of dead satellites in the atmosphere and how they are at risk for collisionsthe last section little bits but a big deal relates back all the information about space junk back to the reader explaining its signifigance and why the reader should care
the author starts out with an exciting yet almost comical opener it wasnt something i expected but obviously something i needed to know since it is currently a concern to government space agencies     the second paragraph begins by giving us some background on what exactly this space junk is it tells us that there are objects positioned hundreds of miles above earth and some of them circle the planet indefinitely now once this piece of highteck space object dies it become one more piece of junk added to space which makes a problem because now its circling the globe in an uncontrolled manner     then it leads us into the crash course section explaining the now dead satellites have the risk of crashing into one another the effect of that happening now causes the problem of tiny little pieces of debris floating around all throughout space but those pieces are not the only debris that roams the atmosphere any object that are released into space become freeorbiting satellites so are astronauts have to be very cautions while in space to be sure nothing is left out in the open     the last topic the author touches on is how little things propose a bigger problem those little pieces are flying around at five miles per second that is pretty dangerous because when we send our spacemen up there if one of those were to hit the shuttle it could easily go strait through it or damage it to a certain degree that would only make their journey more difficult never fear though scientist have worked hard on a solution as to how they will keep track of all the debris and they ended up just giving them different code names and keeping a radar on them at all times that way they know the safety zones for whats good and whats bad
its basically like a debate and this was his side of things he got the information used to show that it is a problem out there or earth too like it said if it got into our atmosphere it could seriously do some damage falling materials all over could wipe out millions of people      its also not healthy for the enviroment of earth and space either the earth could have some more junk all over and if there is junk in pace then it could come really polluted up there who knows how much of our things is hurting everyone
he starts with a grabber then he explains what space junk is then he talk about what happened in 2009 then finally starts talking about the little bits of trash in space
the author organizes the article by using certain parts of history
the author organizes this article by starting out by stating the problem and then moving on to the specific sections that describe different issues such as what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal orbiting junk
the author organizes his thaughts by putting them in order
the author first starts out with an introduction which informs us of what the article is about the author then goes in to a sublevel which tells us of what space junk is the author says that it is stuff that is lost in space and becomes a free roaming satellite the author then goes into a different sublevel called crash course this warns us of what could happen when the space junk gets released the last sublevel is called little bits but a big deal this sublevel tells us that space junk is quite small but it is very dangerous because it flies at a rate of 5 miles per second
by telling what it is and then explaning how it works
the author organized the article to give you supporting details an events showing the reader what ends up in space after so long then when it comes time to get around it the items are to small to detect on radar so they dont know everything that is floating around out there
the author organizes the article in a understandable way he has the title orbiting junk which tells the reader that overall idea then he has subtitles for when hes changing the matter of deatials on space junk for example his first subtitle is what is space junk in that passage he explains throughly to the reader what space junk is he also stays on topic for each section he writes about he dosent get off topic he stays specific about what he writes about
it is just talking about junk and how it can be used
the author organizes the article by having different headlines talking about the stuff that has happen or can happen in space
first the author has an interesting introduction that really grabs a readers attention next the author describes what exactly is being talked about then the problems that the space junk form is talked about and previous incidents that have happened the last paragraph shows the reasons why it is important and how it is dangerous
organizing an article in a way that the reader becomes interested is not always an easy task  this author however did a great job  in stead of starting off with bring facts about space the author decided to use a sense of humor that gets the readers attention  after this the author organized the article in a way that maximizes the education of space junk before the article goes into the harms of it while in space
the author of this article organizes this article by using different topics throughout the peice he uses headings when he changes thought as well these headings help to let the reader understand that he is changing topic and that he is keeping numerous paragraphs under the same topic he organizes this piece very well and keeps the work very consistant
he uses deferent sections to organize the information and group it together there are 4 sections in this paper
he organize this passage into many different descriptive parts each part telling parts about space and how the equipment in space is harmful
the author organizes the article by placing information under a title of a section that applies to what is in the section for example in the section titled what is space junk he tells you what space junk is and how it is formed or created
the author organizes the article by splitting up the topics he wants to cover if he adds a a title to the topic he wants to cover more people will be more willing to read them or even keep reading than if the topic was just all bunched together the author seperates his topics and explains what each topic is to help the reader understand the problem more easily

the author organized the article by putting headings for the different sections to give a better idea about what that paragraph or paragraphs are going to be about just as the author puts what is space junk  crash course which gives brief descriptions about each paragraph
the author uses sub topics or titles if you will for many of his paragraphs these titles let you know what the following paragraphs are about for example crash course lets you know that you wil probably be reading about satellite collisions the author does this through out the articleby doing so he effective organizes his article
the author organizes this article by sectioning it off into subcatagories such as crash course or littlebits but a big deal
the author organizes the article by similar information together after the introduction the author uses a historical timeline of the space race to give the reader information about how we got there then the author discusses how satellites can become space junk the author concludes by discussing how the little bits of space trash can be harmful to our space research
the author organizes the article by explaining at first about the past and when they first had found junk in space then he explained  about how everything went wroong because of something so little
first he grabs your attention with a exclammatory statement then proceeds to explain the main idea of the passage and tells you a little about satellites after he explains the main idea he goes a little more in depth and tells you what the problem is with having dead satellites in space lastly he explains that even the smallest space debris can pose a very serious hazard to a person
the author organizes this article by putting different titles and sections when he is discussing a new topic like he put what is space junk to tell us more about what this term is and then he made a new paragraph crash course so that he could explain what this space junk is doing to us and what is happening around us i think that it was good he put it into different sections becasue it makes it less confusing and it helps us understand  the different parts of the story better
he organizes is very well and clearly spoken with questioning what peoples opihnions are while learning more about the situation
the auther organizes this article by importance it would be important to know what space junk is before you read the other paragraphs to know what happens to space junk
the author first defines what space junk really is for those that are unaware of what it is and how it gets where it is following what is space junk is crash course this section of the article gives an example of when a dead russian satelite and a dead american satelite crashed into eachother little bits but a big deal is the last section and gives the effects that some of these small pieces of debris can harm spacecrafts and even astronauts
the author organize the article in order first he made the introduction appealing by writing its a comet its a meteor its a tool bag to get the readers attention of what space junk is after he explain what space junk is by telling how all started then he explain how the satellites collide with each other and finally he explain the problems space junk causes to space craft and how are countries trying to fix the problem
the author started the article with an attention grabber to spark some interest for the readers they then wrote about the last few decades of space exploration to help the reader understand how often and how much we as a species clutter outer space finaly the author talks about how much damge this space junk can cause to better our understanding of what the consequences are of satalite crashes or other accidents in space
she eplains it in different paragraphs and breaks it down to understand better of what it is and how it was created
the author made the introduction a attention getter than heshe made titles which was followed up behind by details
the author organizes the article by building up the information about space junk and how it will effect futre spece exploration
the author organizes the article by beginning with a few questions that may seem humorous in order to set a tone of interest in the reader as they begin reading the article the author then proceeds to change the tone for he rest of the article to assume a more serious demeanor since he wants to create emphasis on the danger of the topic     the author after the introduction begins by defining what space junk is and how it occurs providing strictly fact or background information on space junk in order to provide an idea about what the article is basically about and to give the reader a rudementary understanding of the subject before the reader is subject to more information or opinions on the subject     the author can then go more deeply into the effects of space junk and who is monitoring it and how it can be harmful to future space exploration
the author organizes the article by using subheadings to talk about different subjects in the same topic for example one of the subheadings is called what is space junk in that section he talks about the type of objects circling around space in the subheading crash course he talks about satellites crashing they talk about the same topic which is relating to space junk but different subjects like how satellites crash
first he explains what 
he starts it off with exciting statements so he can get the readers attention and then he starts goin into good detail about how the space junk can be a serious problem
well he tells that space is full of stuff and what thr reader to know the improtantice of it all
the author organizes the article into groups of paragraphs using bolded words such as what is space junk or crash course
the author organizes the article very neatly the author has the article divided into sections each of which has its own purpose
the article starts out with a catchy introductionby telling readers to grab your telescope the second paragraph goes right into defining what space junk is and how it is harmful it then talks about how satellite crashed can create debris the article goes on to talk about the fact that the debris created cannot be detected if it is smaller than a baseball this means that it is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of the debris the author discribes this as grains of sand being shots from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall
the author organized this article by talking about space junk and how harmful it is to talking about crashes and how little things can be a big deal
he starts out by explaining a small portion of the problem the author then goes in to describe what space junk is defined as so there is a better understanding of the problem the author goes on to state that all satellites will eventually crash into some kind of object at some point and how big of an issue it really is then the author describes that even though the pieces may be really small there is still a large possibility that it can damage the satellite and spacecraft
the author breaks it down into smaller peices he has a whole paper but breaks it down into small secounds with sub titles with in those sub titles he explains more on that situation
first the author uses a hook to get you interested ten they give some background information on the topic including the year 1957 when the russians first entered space they then describe how mor debri is made and why it is a big deal these paragraphs are the main body they concludes by telling what space agencies are doing to find an answere to the problem
the author organizes this article by explaining what is in space then going further in deatil and explaining history of space pollution and how it gets there then finally explains how just small pieces can cause damage forever the author went through that order to make it more understandable and to emphasize the problem to the reader
the author organizes the article by topics the autor will start a new section by adding a title to inform the reader what it will be about the article on crash course is simply explaining the number of collisions made every year in space
the author uses the last sentence from one paragraph to lead into the next paragraph in the last sentence of the first paragraph the author writes this space junk is currently of great concern then the title of the next paragraph is what is space junk the author organizes the paragraphs in such a way as to lead us onto the next topic of discussion
the author organize the article by tellin what is space junk and how why its thier and what happens to th satilltes once it has crashed into another and then he axplain what it looks like in space once it has turn into microscopic peices and is orbiting around the solour system
he has different sections for each big thing he is talking about he makes it easier for people to read and understand why the outer space is so important
the author organizes the article by making titles for each section  for example when the author talks about how space junk can crash into other objects in space the title for that section is crash course  the author also starts off explaining what space junk is then moves on to tell the reader how it is dangerous and explains how big of deal it really is at teh end of the article
the author organize it by the tillin them what to do once they grab the telescope
the article starts with an introduction then explains what space junk is how it happens and why it is important to know about
the author first grabs your attention in a light hearted way by doing a little conversation then he really informs you on the origin of how space junk came to be with 1957 soviet union launced the first artificial satellite which was soon followed by te first usa satellite then he explains how the space junk is affecting current space explorations and projects by the debris destroying high tech very expensive machines in space this was a very easy to understand way to read how over time a tiny piece of debre can become a monumental problem
he organizes it like its a cause and effect essay
the author organizes this article by first grabbing our attenion with the use of a seemingly absurd statement the nexplaining wh ythe statement is not absurd he then tells us the origin of space junk some incidents caused by it and the lingering porblem of space junk in chronological order
throughout the article the author organizes each section by the general time of the action after the beginning when the autor captivates the attention of the reader the author begins to tell the reader about the first launching of space satellites and the particular elements of space science the author then begins to write about the relevance of space debris to now followed by any solutions that have been brought up in the past years
the author divides the article in to 4 sections first is draw the attention of the reader us the second section is to identify what space junk is and what the article is about the next section is about how satilites crash and what happens after the problem occurs last he exsplains why the problem is a serous matter and what scientists are doing to fix the problem
the author organizes the article by going in order of importance or relevant information the author first explains what space junk is by giving the reader a brief overview of the definition and history of spacejunk next the author discusses how space junk can come about explaining that dead satellites may ultimately mulitply into a mass amount of space junk if said satellite crashes into another dead satellite finally the author stresses the importance of the dangers of space junk stating that any microdebris smaller than the size of a baseball can go undetected this undected microdebris may pose as a serious threat to space travelers because the microdebris may cause harm to the spacecraft
the author starts by making a simple statement than he explains what space junk is and how it cause our earth many problems in the third sections the author explains crash course which is uncontroled satellites that collide with each other causing pieces of debris to fly through spacein his final section he explains that even though the problem is small its still a big deal the paragraph explains a small fragment travling at the speed of five miles per second can cause serious damagewhich is followed by the auther saying that the problem is increasingthe whole article explains and show more information to us to better understand
the author puts everything in sections so that it is easy to understand
the author organizes this article by telling what space junk is then how it effects and other things such as satellites also the author gives examples to help compare what it is like for a small piece of debris in space smashing into a satellite one example from the article to give us an idea of what it is like in space like if a grain of sand were blowing in the wind vs a grain of sand chipping paint off of a wall
by explaining diferent problems and courses
he organizes it with a narrative prompt and an essay to go with it
right away the author grabs the readers attention but shortly after that she becomes serious she starts off by explaining what space junk is and what kind of junk we have floating around in space she provides the background information to help us understand the rest of the article she next tells us the damages done in the crash course section in the end the author expresses to us how little particles can cause the most damge
he makes it exciting at first then settles down and gets serious about the satellites and how important they are and how dangerous it is if they hit stuff
the author organizes his information by organizing it by the topic or incident it pertains too for example they sort all the information about the satellites collision of 2009  into a paragraph titled crash course also they title the paragraph telling the reader exactly what this cosmic debris is in a paragraph title what is space junk
they explore the vas reaches of the solar sistem monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless
first the author grabs our attention with his first statements by acting as if hes telling you to look in the sky next he uses one paragraph to sum up just the topic of his article after his one paragraph he decides to tell you more information by organized sections the first section tells you what space junk is so you can know what he means when talking after you have realized what space junk is he goes on to give a example on what can happen with space junk when he trys to tell you of how small things at a fast pace can be dangerous he tell you about that in the next article basically the author uses two beginning statements one paragraph and 3 sections to explain and organize his concerns on space junk
the author uses an interesting introduction to catch the readers attention then he breaks down all the omportant things about space junk he emphasizes the importance of how dangerous space junk can be
the author organizes the article by using different topics at each paragraph and by explaining why each are different at each paragragh and how each differ and rise in each paragraph it also talks about the problems that each face and how to overcome them
the author organizes this article in such a way that answers a question that a reader may have once they gain new information in the previous section or paragraph for instance in the introduction we learn the term space junk the next section of the article is titled what is space junk the next title crash course helps to show what has caused this issue of space junk the next section little bits but a big deal addresses any doubts that the reader may have about space junk being a true issue this organization makes the article easy for the reader to read and comprehend
he organizes his article in sections each section is in order explaining the last this allows a reader to not get lost
each paragraph fits in with the next one
the author starts off by giving us a attention getter then telling us about the history of space travel then giving us some statistics about crashes and teeling us about how its a big deal to lose small things in space a baseball size space junk is enough to damage a space craft then they give us the ending
the author organizes the artical by explaining each fact at a time what it is or means and why it should be such a concern for example what is space junk the author answers the question and gives strong details doing so from there the real reason the person wrote the article becomes rather clear its a freaking serious issue i mean just image a grain of sand going 5 miles a second how many seconds does it take to drive five miles in a car better yet walk i wouldnt think one second even though that would be pretty awesome
the author puts it in order as he first explains what space junk is then explains how it causes problems this is through how they put what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal in the order they are in
the author organizes the article very clearly  the author seperates the article into pieces and gives a titles for all of the new topics  the author is generally just trying to get the reader to understand the meaning of orbiting junk
the author starts with a simple introduction that begins to lead the reader into the article after the introduction the author begins explaining what space junk is in case the reader does not know the author wants to make sure the reader understands the term and knows what he is referencing to the the author gets into describing how dangerous space junk can be he or she explains how satellites have the risk of colliding with each other the author also tells of the dangers of the small debris that results from the collision he or she tells the reader of how these tiny fragments can result in serious damage and in the end of the article the author emphasizes that the problem is becoming worse and that space agencies hope to solve the problem soon but havent come up with a solution yet
the author organizes the article into three different subtopics that all have something to do with the main topic of the article in the first section he talks about space junk and what it is in the second section he talks about satellites that crash into each other and creat space junk and in the third section the author describes the size and effect of space debri
the author organizes the article first telling you what is space junk because some people dont know then telling you the dangers of crash cource the last thing the author talks about it the little things that cause a big problem i think the author did a really good job organizing the article giving the reader alot of information that they might have not known
the author organizes the writing with sub headings that explain what point she is going to talk about next
with humor and facts
the author organizes the article in order from least important to most important he starts out first by telling when poeple first send things to space then he goes into detail about the harmful space debris floating around
he backs up all of his details this was a very intrestng article to read
the author goes from grabbing the readers attention with the introduction to explaining exactly what space junk is the author then explains examples of how space junk is created and that it creates little bits of debris then in the final paragraph the author explains the threat that these little pieces of debris offer to our spacecraft
the article  starts out by grabbing you attention and introduces you to the term space junk then it explains what space junk is and starts talking about satellite crashes it then moves on to talking about the smaller things in space and concludes with how space agencies are trying to fix the problem
the author first grabs the readers attention in the introduction by including humor he then proceeds to include factual evidence and history to help prove his point he organized the paragraph into four sections each including a different point this lets the reader know what a certain part is talking about without having to read the whole thing for examble in the paragraph titled what is space junk the author defines the term and lets the reader know about space junk
the author organizes the article by first explaing what space junk is by calling the first section what is space junk  then the author explains what could happen and why it is a big problem in the sections crash course and little bits but a big deal the authors article ends well explaing what scientist around the world are trying to do about it
the author organizes the article by using different headings to inform the reader in the best way possible  for example the author starts with an interesting opening to grab the readers attention  the author then starts witht he heading what is space junk and informs the reader with information about what space junk is  the author does this with the other two headings as well to make it easier for the reader to understand his points
the author organized this article from start to finish he or she had an interesting opening sentence from there they start out with how space exploration started and how the debris got there they went on to explain that debris is a big problem and we are trying to get rid of it but it still continues to grow
the author first starts out catching the eye of a reader and started to make the reader think about what the passage will be about then the author tells facts and statistics about the space and how space junk can effect the people living here most of the passage is to explain things that might happen or what might be in space that and harm people of the world
he orders the article from not so important to realy impotant
it is in sections and it is alot easier to read when its in this form of way the author also give a great amout of detail in this article especially in the what is space junk it tells you what it is when it is mad and where it even came from
the author organizes this by putting the subjects into different paragraphs
he organizes these paragraphs by telling interesting stuff about outspace
the author makes the article an attention grabber once he has the readers attenchion he moves on to the more important facts the author makes sure the readers know that space has many dangerous things out there
he puts in different sections to help you understad it better
the author first starts out by saying something funny and outrageous to get your attention then the author explains that their outrageous statement is true then the author gets a bit more serious they start to divide the article in little subsections depending on the topic they bring it all together at the end for a strong finish
the author uses an interesting introduction to get the readers attention then he or she tells us what a little bit about the topic and what space junk really is then the author goes on to tell us that crashes are a big deal and cause debris finally he or she tells us more about space junk even though they are small space junk and debris is a serious matter
he organizes it by using a itroduction to grab your attention then in the section what is space junk he decribes the problem with salalites that are not used anymore and about little debris then in the section crash course he describes how dangerous these microparticles can be to space shuttles and satalites
scientist are hardpressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk
the author organizes the article in chronological order and order of importance from explaining how space junk can be very dangerous to satellites eventually crashing into one another and a lost tool bag in space
in the beginning the author makes sure he catches your attention with an excited attitude by using explination marks and so on the second section gives us facts and an idea of what space junk is it explains to us a little background information about the subject the paragraph labeled crash course helps support the intire article by allowing us to read history about past expieriences with space junk little bits but a big deal summons up the intire article it tells us why space junk is a problem to the atmospehere and that they have yet to find a solution
the author organizes the article by first grabbing your attention with a familar statement then indroducing the reader to the topic with background indformation  what is space junk informs the reader about the first satellite going into space  after that the author gives support to let the reader know what happens because of space junk with the paragraph crash course  in the end the article is summed up by stating that space jumk is harmful  the author stuck to their porpose for writing the article and successfully provided facts to compliment the topic
the author organizes the article by including an intro body and conclusion  also the body is separated into three parts which all talk about different issues with space junk  the first part of the body is used to define space junk and give the reader an idea of what it is  the second part is used to show how satellites crash into each other a lot  finally the last part is used to describe how space junk can be very small but still cause problems
telling the dangers of space
it goes in sequence starting with what orbits around the earth then it tells us about what is orbiting around the earth it then tells us that eventually everything in the outerspace will collide and it will hit the earth and explode into little pieces
this is organized by the background information on the story which was how the satellite was built and many other things like that
by naming every type of problems that can go on up in space
the author is organized and has very goood supporting details that are true
the organization is from past to present he first tell you about the orbiting of space an what is out thier then he calls it junk because sometimes the stuff they lost or put in space becomes very dangerous to the planet but no one knows the reason why because if you tell people the truth they wouldnt know how to handle it or how to act when you tell them some people over exzagerate the problem and cause all kinds of confusion space is a dangerous place to enter and play around with there is no gravity or oxygen to provide unless your on a spaceship most times space ships are not even safe some people can not handle moving slow or seeing things they have never seen before   he was telling about the spaceship that was first launched in 1957 by the soviet union but it was artificial and the the united states followed suit whicha began the human races great space invation thing like that causes confusion to everyone who can not ake it he also was giving information about the variety of spacecrafts their was and about the global communicaton an how they launch spaceships he kept it plan an simple and to the point how distrutive people are to their world and even to outerspace that is most dangerous to the earth   in conclusion the fact that the matter is no matter how big small tiny or larger objects are it is so dangerous to people an the earth and its surroundings it could cause major damage to people and the earth if it falls straight out from the sky
the author organizes this article very well after finishing a paragraph while typing about a topic the next paragraph will be about that topic the author seemed to have wanted to explain the topics in the best way he good to get the reader to understand the author wants the reader to be concerned and not to be confused about anything he talked about
the author uses titles to seperate sections into specific topics the titles the author uses are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
that the space are som what alike and the differ times but yetthe problem is certain to persist
telling people about the space jumk and realizing that people really care about this stuff and they should pay attention on whats happing with earth today
the auther organizes the article by giving each new section of information a subheading this helps the reader to know what they are about to read about and helps the researcher easily find the information they are searching for the author breaks this article up into 3 different parts to better organize the article and to allow people to give him more credit and trust with the information
the author organizes his article by topic the author uses subheadings within the article to tell the reader the change in detail such as the shift from crash course to little bits but a big deal as a reader if the author did not use these subheadings the article would have made very little sense and seem very disorganized because the author used the progression of thought and subtitles it was very organized and easy to follow this is why the author organized the article by topic
the author starts out using dialog then goes into all of the other things like what it is and how it was made

the author organizes this article by putting a heading or title to each section of the piece this gives the reader an idea about what that section is going to be about
the author organizes this article into four sections the first section orbiting junk grabs the readers attention and explains how space junk is a concern in goverment space agencies the second section what is space junk explains how spacecrafts in the atmosphere can result in junk that begin to circle earth in an uncontrolled orbit crash course explains why governments are concerned with the debris by illustrating a crash between satellites the conclusion little bits but a big deal explains that the problem is only increasing and space agencies are trying desperately to end the space pollution and damage
the author organizes the article by starting off with an interesting introduction and heading from there to the history and the serious things that people need to know about space craft and how it effects our solar system
he organizes the article in a way to make it easier for the reader to read the way he has a name for each section like what is space junk and crash course it just makes it easier to follow
they begin the article with a catching introduction drawing the reader to the article with a humourous quote they add a twist to the quote its a    tool bag this is to foreshadow the story of the accident in which a toolbag escaped the grip of an astronaut during a repair on the internation space station the author proceeds to explain what space junk is and how much of it is formed the article explains the dangers of dead satellites that can crash into each other it explains that with the increase of space exploration there will be a collective increase of space junk the author says that many people care about the space junk offering opposition to readers who are indifferent to this issue the author concludes that space agencies should work together to find a solution to this important problem
the author tells you good true facts about space junk and also give gooddiscrption about whatcould happen in the futuer if we humans keep on creating junk in space
the author organizes the article by separating different information into different sections for example one section labeled what is space junk only talks about what space junk is and explains the history of space junk
the author organizes his article by the order in which it happens and by importance the first one what is space junk  second crash course and third   little bitsbut a big deal
the author organizes this article in a very clever way first the author describes what space junk is and how it comes about in space second the author gives examples of how space junk effects satelites and other space equipment lastly she explains the efforts of the various space administrations who want to reduce the ammount of space debris to show that they share the same concern for the safety of outer space just as we do
the author organizes this article with chronological information bits and bits of information leading into the main topic of the story
first the author has a good hooker that makes the reader want to continue to read the article then heshe tells what the problem is that needs to be fixed following that are details of what has happened as a result of the problem at hand finally heshe states what can and will happen from all the junk in space
the author starts the article with a phrase that might be said by a normal person and grabs their attention by saying something not expected when they say its a tool bag this first paragraph states what this is the next paragraph then explains what the space junk is and how it came about the paragraph says this when it explains the great space invasion then the section crash course explains the crashing of orbiting satellites  and other orbiting junk such as a tool bag the last section explains how the junk is a big deal when it says the debris from the space junk can cause holes in the space ships we design
he puts them in order by how they affect us
first the author uses unusual statements to grab the readers attetion there is no way that anyone would expect a tool bad to be in the sky then the author gives some facts about space exploration and explains what space junk is after that the author gives a specific anecdote about how an american and russian satellite crashed this crash caused much debris and poses a huge fdanger to any future space travel finally the author explains how even very small space debris can be very dangerous to carefully designed spacecrafts
i think that the author organized this article very well the introduction was very attention grabing it was dramatic and made me want to read more of it as it went on then he posses a question which led to a sort of history leason the author then gives you information about each topic using very good examples to give the reader a good idea of how something so little can be so harmful when it is at a high rated speed
the author organize the article by fist informing the reader with fact about the main subject informing the read on the importance of satellitesgiving important details before coming with the conflict the author gave detail to detail about the problem withe space junk then ended with how the problem is sopposed to be fixed that is how the article was organized by the author
the author first states and observation found in space and then he tells you what it is and explains space junk next he tells you what this space junk can cause then he tells you why these little things are big deals and what they harm in space
the author uses small titles and organizes the article from that
this article is organized by topics in the beginning its exciting to catch readers attention and then it goes on to a more serious moodit tells you what space junk isthen tells you why it is important and dangerous after that it tells you about satellites and why they are a problemafter that it talks about the size of the trash and the dangers of the speeds
the author organizes the article by dates
the author of orbiting junk organizes the article by topics these topics include what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal organizing this article into these catagories makes it easier to read and comprehend for the readers i believe it is a sufficient way to stay interested in the article and to make it easier to read
the author organizes the article in a way that gives the reader backround information about the pollution and hints at its possible danger but doesnt reveal it until the last section when the author spills all of this information about the pollution at the end it has a bigger impact on the audience the reader is more likely to remember something if all of the key points are in one spot rather than scattered throughout the text
the author organizes the article very well keeps up and stays on topic and easy to follow along
the author organize the article by staying on topic and he also indents the author uses a title evertime he whats to talk about a different type of stuff about space
the auther of orbiting junk organizes the article by starting with a good attention getter followed by some brief history of the subject then talking about problems of the main idea and ending with a passage that leaves readers thinking about the future
the author estory avobe the information and chose the most important
the author starts out by grabbing your attention with a few random statements heshe then proceeds to describe what space junk is and some of the different objects that are considered space junk the author then goes into how space objects can crash into other objects and therefore make a million other tiny objects the author then talks about how these pieces are very harmful in the conclusion the author talks about how space programs are trying to come up with a way to get rid of space junk
the aurthur organizes it with a hooking sentence then hits you with some facts of space exploration then tells you what the explorations leave behind and how dangerous and serious space trash is
the author sorganize the article by making a statement and then giving you information on the statemant like for example 4 in 1957  the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite  now the statement to support what the author just said the united states followed suit and thus began the human races great space invasion
i think how the author organize the article is that the author want to give out information about orbiting junk in space and put into to sections to inform the reader
the author organizes the article by first explaining what the problem we face is in what is space junk then the author states how space junk was created in crash course and lastly the author explains why space junk is a big deal in little bits but a big deal
the article orbiting junk is organized into four main sections the introduction uses shocking statements in order to grab the readers attention and then begins to more seriously address the facts and basics of space junk in the second section what is space junk following that the article really begins to stress the serious nature of the space junk problem section three titled crash course relates both a story of collision on a major scale as well as how mere human error can create a notable problem the final section little bits but a big deal is both a description of what even the smallest bits of space junk can do as well as a summary and conclusion to the article
the author organizes the article in an effective way he starts off telling the reader what space junk is then he goes on to describe the dangers of the space junk an finally he says why its such a big deal
he pust each part of the artical in its own chapter starting off not so serious and working his way down to how it can impact the earth and how its hard to work on stuff in space
the authur organizes the article by starting it off with shocking sayings and paintings of vivid images of tools and tool bags flying through the air then the tone becomes more serious and the authur states more realistic facts in an effort to draw our attention down the page then the authur leaves us with a bit of a cliff hanger by stating that the problem of flying space junk will not end soon in fact it is getting worse around the world space agencies and nations a like are working together in an effort to clean up the junk
first the author explains to us what space junk exactly is therefore explaining the first paragraph and title then the author explains how space junk comes to be from colliding ships and satellites then the author explains how that debri affects us down on earth
the author organizes this article by topic he puts a catchy introduction first then follows up with explaining the different parts of space exploration in great detail he gives background information on all of the topics
they orginize it with titles and subtitles they also put all similer information in one group
in the introduction the author catches your attention with the thoughts of someone then the author goes into the the facts about how things got into space in the first place the author then goes into why its bad to have things in space then the author tells you why its dangerous and what will happen in the future with space junk
the author makes it seem like space travel is really harmfull but people do it all the time
he talks about all of the problems with space junk and its effect on humans and other things
the author organizes this article according to what you know and how you learn something such as the first section is to grab you attention so you want to read more the second is to identify and explain what the topic is the third is to go more into depth about the topic and the fourth is to explain why you should care and the dangers of the topic its organized as an informal persuading article overall
he organizes it by placing what is used by humans and facts about the satilites  and what goes on in space 
in the article there are other articles that go with it they are broken up in catigories and have there own titles
the author starts off by keeping it simple where everyone can follow along easily then he starts a new heading where he then begins to state facts that explain how space debree is dangerous and polluting space after the new heading he just uses paragraphs to finish off his article
the autor organizes the article by starting with events that happened first such as saying  in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satilite also stating  two communication satilites one american and one russian both traveling at more than 20000 miles per hour crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth
the author organizes the article by introuducing you to what the article is about then it tells you the problems about space
he uses them in order on which questions would apear if someone doesnt know why a tool bag would be in space or wants to know what space junk is the auther tells them right off the bat the auther talks about how they collied and make smaller pieces which explains the crash course paragraph it then talks about the little pieces that break off which is the purpose for little bits but a big deal each paragraph has a purpose and they are all in order
the author starts with an opening statment to get the readers attention then he moves on to the topic sentence in the introduction to say what the article is about the author uses headings to seperate the article into parts after that the author uses body paragraphs to explain what space junk is and explain the problems it could cause finally the author tells what is going to comtinue happening for the conclusion
he orginizes the passage by first introducing what it is then moves each part into detail about a particular object for example it starts by asking what is space junk and telling us all about it then it goes into what causes it or as it is called crash course and last he tells how he feels about all the space junk in the last paragraphs called little bits but a big deal
he organizes it into several sections each section being about its own topic one being about collisions and how space debris appears another being the potentioal problem that it could inflict then another about the hisory of space exploration
he organizes the information by a description of what it is about the effects and how dangerous it can be the titles in the article are clever and that gives the reader an idea of whats to come
the author organizes the article by giving a good start in the beggining starting off eith an retorical question and then following with a serious manner problem the author then explains what apce junk is and how dangerous it can be then it continues with the dangerourous crashes in space crashes then create harmfull debris then at the end explaining that little bits are big deal to the earth
the author in this article is very good about how he or she wrote it the author started with an introduction that gave you a main idea about what your going to read then the author made sure you had the history down before you went any further and after that gave you the main problems with space research overall it is a very well put together article
the author organizes the article by first talking about all of the space parts that are orbiting around the earth to help the reader better understand how many things are in space  next the author describes how dangerous leaving hightech junk in space can be  the author gives an example of the emphasis put on the strength of this debris by saying  instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space  the author continues on by trying to keep the reader interested in how much of a problem the microsatellites can be in little bits but a big deal  the author finishes by saying the problem is still increasing instead of being fixed
it starts off by stating what space junk is then it gives some history like back in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite then it talks about the risk of satellites running into eachother causing pieces of that to fly out into space space debris is a very serious problem they can be powerful enough to creat disastrous holes in an object moving through space
the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is which he says are pieces of sattelites that get stuck in orbit he explains how the junk comes to be and what happens to it he also gives information on how space junk comes to be it is caused when sattelites break or run into eachother      lastly he describes the bad effects space junk have he says all of the upcoming space exploration is increasing the amount of space junk which is cluttering the atomsphere he says the new amounts is making space travel more difficult and everyone needs to work together to limit the amounts
the author of this article organized his work into sections he began with in introduction to help introduce the problem and catch the readers attention then he explained the basic history of what we have in our orbital in the section called what is space junk through crash course the author explained what the space junk does that makes it a problem to any space program finally he wraps up with his conclusion and explains how it effects us as a community and a planet
the author organizes this article by the importance of each fact
they narrow the artical to more specific points
the author organizes in different subsections that he or she believes fit together i like this idea because sections like crash course can easily be identified as the section where collisions are found
the author organized this story into different sections the author first gets our attention with the introductions the author then gives us some background information on the history of space junk and how it can effect the earth next we find out how harmful this space junk really is it talks about the collisions of satellites and how they are harmful to earth finally the author tells us that once they have collided they are formed into little bits that are still a big deal it is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of this tiny object
the author organizes the article in little sections to highlight each thing you need to know about space junk like the first section what is space junk the author explains what space junk is and where it comes from the crash course section talked about two satellites colliding into each other the little bits but a big deal section talks about the hazards of microdebris floating through space and the increasing amount amount of space junk  caused by commercial space travel
i really dont understand the question you are aking me
they talk about the history of satelites
the author organizes the article in a very good way the introduction is first next we find out what space junk actually is then it talks about how it is made when satellites collide and crash which causes it to form into smaller pices because everything breaks apart at very fast speeds
the authour organize the article by folloowing from the beginning to where it talk about space junk secondly it goes from there to where it ends to crash of the course lastly it goes to big deals where it talkls about tiny fragments traveling at speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft
the autor put it in a order where the reader will know where to look to find information
well he starts off as like in a excited tone but then goes into detail about how space junk jas came to be and made our solar system very very dangerous and how a lot of our satelites can be destroyed from these little pieces of debris moving at a high rate of speed
the author organize the article by breaking each of the thing he want to tlak about into three little section like the first one is really just telling you about the junk the be in space and the second is talking about how you can crash why you in space if you dont have all control of your spaceship and the last one just talks about lilttle things that can fall from spcae and some people dont think that its a big deal but it is
the author organizes the article by not just putting ideas in paragraphs but also puts them in groups with titles for that paragraph or group of paragraphs
by using subheadings to organize what the following paragraph will be about the author categorizes information and puts them in paragraphs with a like topic
the auther organizes this articale by starting this article with a shocking statement to make the reader want to read the article after the auther has the readers attention the auther uses facts to show the dangers of space junk and why it is a big deal
he explains what it is what happens due to that space junk and then some facts about what has happened
after the introduction the author defines what they are talking about the first section is what is space junk in this section the author talks about what space junk is and how it is formed the second second is called crash course and it is about the dangers of the space junk and then the author transitions into a related topic tiny bits of space trash the author talks about the dangers of even a small bit of space debris the author concludes by talking about the current state of the problem of space junk and intiatives to try and solve the problem of space junk throughout the entire story it is a progression setting the story up defining terms and talking about how they are formed what role they play what damage they can do and finally ways to stop the problem
the author starts with a catchy introduction that is an allusion to a common phrase from superman heshe continues on with explaining in general what space junk is and how some of it got into space crash course the next section of the article explains in more detail of two incidents in space that created space debris a crash and a dropped tool box finally the last few paragraphs explain why the little peices of space debris have such an impact due to the high speeds at which they travel it also mentions why we should be concerened and how this problem if not solved quickly will become an even larger issue due to more and more space travel in the near future
the author organizes the article by introducing the concept of space junk in a fun way but quickly gets serious as the articles pass he explains space junk by reviewing the space age then getting to the matter at hand he states that space junk is mostly created by satalite collisions in one article and also stating that microdebris from the space junk is very harmful to astronauts the author explains the problem very well through a series of paragraphs
the author grabs the readers attention with the opening paragraph the following sections are used to explain what exactly the author is relating to youthe author provides headings to give you an idea of what you will be informed about next
the author organizes the article by seperating it into sections of what happens and what they do to help the sections are the introduction what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal these sections tell us exactly how harmful space junk is and how it is caused
he starts off the article with interesting statements that shock you into doing it once he realizes you are paying attention he then starts to tell you about the history of satellites the author tells you about some crashest that have happened to keep you interested and then goes back into important facts that you need to know such as how the smallest things can turn into the biggest problems
the author goes by topics and provides facts and sometimes his own opinion in the paragraphs he starts out some of the paragraphs with quesitons and then he answers them he backs up all of his paragraphs with very well used information
the author starts off by explaining what space junk is then explains how it can cause minor problems along with serious ones and why people should care the tool bag is one of the issues also the author gives information about a solution and how the problem is only getting worse
because they tell all about the space stuff
she puts subtitles to try to divid the importance of space
the author organizes this article into catagories and paragraphs each section in the story has its own signifcance to the background knowledge and effects of space junk the section titled what is space junk refers to what it really is and how long its been in our orbit
he starts with what it is about then tells some of the history about it then tells what is going to happen if were not careful
farily decent
the author begins with a catchy lead in then he dives into the real issue space junk he then gives us a brief over view of space junk history and nasa history he then explains how dead satellites are a major issue and what they can do to one another he also explains other forms of debris then he finally comes to his point why its a big problem and how we are trying to fix it
the author starts with a lucrative introduction and moves into the background information once the cause of the junk has been defined the author tells the major causes of debris such as satellite crashes and accidents by astronauts it then goes onto describe how and why we need to fix this very serious problem that we have caused by careless space exploration the author then comes to a conclusion that the problem will ensue despite efforts to contain it
the author arganizes the article be having differernt titles in the one article  the author does it by the importance of how it should be informed to others
thos author organizes the article by introducing the problem the he or she provides background information on how this problem occurs the he or she goes into explaining the dangers and how to prevent them
the author organizes the article by giving each different section a title like what is space junk or crash course to give you an idea of what the section is about
the author starts off by stating what he sees in the sky is nothing but a simple tool bag then he shoots right into detail about space junk the author explains to us that space junk is more of a problem than we might see it as he goes on by telling us how dangerous it could be and how it could occur then states that engineers are seeking and adding improvements to spacecrafts and spacesuits so they can withstand this space junk
the author organizes the article by starting off with an attention getter in the introduction after the introduction the author startst to use a serious tone with the reader he starts to define how the problem started     the author then goes through and starts to emphasize the things that you read in the article by the end of the article everything that you have read makes more sense because you everything has been defined previously in the article
the author organizes the article in different sections to seperate the topicseach topic has a heading telling what it is about
the author organizes the article by first trying to get the readers attention he proclaims things such as grab your telescope then the author begins to define how objects released in space will always orbit the planet even after they have malfunctioned this creates a great concern to government space agencies around the globe the author then addresses the topic of how space debris is created for example when two communications satellitesboth traveling at more than 20000 miles per hour crashed they produced hundreds of pieces of debris next the author informs the reader of how these tiny pieces can be very harmful and dangerous in addition to the danger they pose the problem is certain to persist last the author includes facts on how this issue will worsen
he orgonizes it in sections by doing this if a reeder wants to look back he can find a statement much easyer
the author first grabs the readers attention by using a line from a superman quote heshe then turns into serious mode and talks about space explorations and how objects can be detached from an exploration then the author gives an example of a crash in space between two satelites that ran into eachother and made milions of tiny satelites the author concludes the article by talking about what scientists can do to prevent space junk in the future
the author organizes the article by first describing what is space junk space junk is a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earhts atmosphere then the author simply tells about all the things that are included in the sapce junk
the author organizes the article into four sections the introduction which introduces the reader to space junk with an anecdotal occurence what is space junk which describes countless objects orbiting the earth crash course which descibes the events of satellites and other orbiting objects crashing into eachother and little bits but a big deal which explains how serious space junk is and what problems it can cause
the author organizes the artical from least important to most important
the author organizes the article with several different pieces of writing put into one it makes this article a good read
the article is organized by certain topics each paragraph is about something specific for example the crash course paragraph is mainly about collisons of the space junk little bits but a big deal is about how smaller debris moving at a high speed can still cause a lot of damage
the way he got everything organized is like he got everything label and know where exactly where too go
the article follows causeandeffect organizational pattern  from the prelude in the introduction it moves onto a description of the history of space travel furthermore it descbribes how a celestial satellite becomes space junk  in the last part of the article entitled little bits but a big deal it explains how the microscopic pieces of loose material up in space can become a dangerous problem to travelling satellites  from the cause of space pollution to the effect of dangerous environments in space travel the organization helps to understand the nature of the problem at hand  furthermore the article is divided into labeled sections describing the common themes for the compilations
the author ordanizes the article by cause and effect he says that we send stuff into space but when we do some of the stuff becomes free flowing junk in space
the author first tells us a statistic about space junk being very harmful he then tell us about the history of satellites and he tells us about how the term space junk was first talked about the author now talks about satellites colliding with each other and creating all of this debris now he finally tells about how much of a big deal this matter is in our world
the auther organize the article in different sections about what he is talking about and also each section has different information about the topic he talks about that is how he organizes it in the article
the author organizes the article by first grabbing our attention to read the article then heshe tells us mainly what the article is about concluding why the first title into the reading is what is space junk after reading that information we now can be educated with negative effects of satellites finally in the conclusion we can relate the satellites to our environments today
