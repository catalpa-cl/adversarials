starting with mrna leaving the nucleus list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis
the mrna travels to the ribosomes at the ribosomes the mrna is copied so that is can be used to create proteinsthe copies mrna is then used as instructions to create proteinsthe proteins are made using the instructions given
atp is created and broken downit is broken down when 2 phosphate groups dont connect with the third causing adpadp can make atp again by remaking itself
the mrna first gets on an electron transport chain
the mrna then travels to the mitochondria where it is then copiedthen one mrna goes to the nucleus while the other goes to the ribosomes where it transfers its infornmation to the organelle the organelle then reads the infornmation and makes proteins
first thing the mrna does is go to the ribosome  next the trna comes and decodes the first three nucleotides  then the trna brings over the amino acid that matches the codon  last the trna shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another
goes to the er then golgi bodys
messenger rna collect  the protein particals inside the nucleus of the cell the the transport rna comes by to collect those prteins in that cell and takes them to anothe rcell in the body so that that part of the body can absorb those protein and use tem in the function of protein sythesis
translation the amino acid code is translatedtranscription the amino acid code is readsynthesisthe protein is made introduction the code is given
1 the mrna takes the copied information out into the cytoplasm2 there trna brings in nucleotides to pair up with the mrna inorder to make a copy of the dna strand3 an amino acid is then paired up with each set of three nucleotides4 once the process is completed it is used to make a protein
first the mrna leaves the cell nucleus and moves to the ribosome where trna finds complementary bases
the mrna brings the protein to another place in the cell via the golgi apperatusan amino acid forms the proteinthe protein begins to form in the smooth endoplasmic reticliumthe protein is refined in the rough endoplasmic reticlium
mrna leaves the  nucleus then it enters the cytoplam and proceeds to the er
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna transports to the reticulum3 the mrna hooks onto a dna4 the mrna is transported by the trna back to the nucleus
anaphase metaphase prophase telophase
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows mrna enters a ribosome then trna delivers amino acids to the ribosome the mrna codon matches with the trna anticodon also the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction this process is repeated until a stop code is reached
1the mrna sends a message to ribosomes to send anticodons2 the anticodons place themselves on the matching portion of the mrna strand3 the ribosomes begin to create proteins4 the opposite rna strand of the original mrna is created
prophase metaphase anaphase telophase
it sends instructions for the amino acid sequence if a protein
the mrna trvales through the cytoplasm then enters the ribosome then the ribosome decodes the amino acids and then the mrna leaves the ribosome and the ribosome makes more of that codon
mrna messenger rna where it send messages throughout the cellrrna ribosomal rna is where ribosomes make protienstrna transfer rna where is transfers the proteins
ribsomesnucleusanaphasemoonchadrion
protein synthesis is needed in your body because of the proteins the four major steps are when it occurs in the body and when your body uses the protien
once mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to the other cells in which the protein is started to be made by the end of the mrnas journey protein is formed
the dna then begins to reproduce  then mitosis takes place then the off spring is present
the mrna exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cellribisome produce proteins according to the directions on the mrnathe produced proteins are arranged in the order described by the rnathey proteins go through the rough endoplasmic reticulum for further modification
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it fits through the holes by virtue of being singlestranded the mrna floats around until it encounters a ribosome the ribosome latches on to the mrna with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases called a codon at a time the ribosome says in semistasis until a trna with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it the trna is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read and a second trna is bonded to by the ribosome a peptide dehydration synthesis bond forms between the two amino acids and the initial trna is cut loose the ribosome then moves on down the mrna creating the protein coded for a strand of mrna can be translated several times
1 mitosis2 meiosis3 dna extraction4 blood transfer
1 mrna leaves the nucleus on a dna strand2 ribosomes produce proteins3 ribosomes then carry the proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum4 there the proteins are synthesized
once the mrna leaves the nucleus it has to make another kind of rna to transfer the information to the other parts of the cells and the body the codons of the messenger rna are matched up with their codons for a transfer rna the transfer rna is made and can then continue to do its job while more transfer rnas are being copied then the rnas can go to the ribosomes and give them the message to make more proteins
1 the mrna attaches to a ribosome to begin protein synthesis2 the correct amino acid attaches to the first part of the mrna in the psite while in the asite another amino acid waits3 the ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops
the mrna leaves the cell cell makes protienmrna bings it back cell uses it
1 mrna will leave the nucleus2 it will find a chromosome then attach to it3 it will then go through codons before adding on to it4
the first major step involved in protein synthesis is mrna leaving the nucleus when the mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the amino acid sequence back to the protein which then results in the second major step which is passive transport passive transport brings proteins in and out of the cell the third step is the when the mitocondria is making its way to help out the other cells with the protein synthesis the last step is when the protein is making its way back to where is suppost to go resulting in protein synthesis
cells are know to use many things in cell mvment such as mrna they also use trnanrna
there four major steps of protien synthesis the first is the mrna going to the rrna then the rrna takes the information from the mrna to the trna next the trna will take the information it has and translate it lastly the trna will take the information and make a protein
mrna tell instructions to the messenger trna makes proteins and oxygen and hydrogen
1 mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes2 once in the ribosomes the mrna gets turned into trna3 the trna is gathered by the ribosomes to see what the amino acid sequence is4 the right things are given to the cell to make proteins
the mrna is copied and the coped strand is taken to the
first starting at the mrna it goes to trna which transfers it to rrna and then grna
mrna leaves the nuleus and carries instructions for amino acid sequence of a protien to the ribosomes where it helps code the amino acid and makes the protien
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the sequence to the cytoplasm then the rrna transports it to to the trna  then the trna takes it to the opposite sequence of dna where the process is completed
1 it travals to the cytoplasm2 the ridosomes read the rna strand3 the protein is made4 the porsess is repeteed
sugarcarbondyoxides
mrna diffusion energy sunlight protein leaving the cell
1 leaving2 spreading in body3 attending to your body4 supplies minerals to body
the mrna will arrive at the ribosome with a message to make proteins the proteins will begin to duplicate its chromosomes then the outer membrane will reform and it will have made two new proteins then trna will transfer the newly split proteins to wherever they are needed
it moves to trna then it moves to transcription
mutationdiversionmrnaduplication
mrna travels to give amino acids to trna which then transfers the information to a ribosome where it is then turned into a protien and last the protien is joined with others to make a strand of dna
prophase metaphase anaphase telephase
first a strand of mrna leaves the nucleus out into the cell once outside the mrna arrives at the ribosome trna then arrives with an amino acid containing a nucleotide sequence called a codon these codons are sequenced and once the end of the sequence is reached the protein synthesis ends until a new protein is needed
prophas metaphas anaphas and telaphas
mrna travels through the bodymrna changes into proteinprotein then travels back through the bodythe protein is then transfered back to mrna
proteins need calciumthey need vitaman cthey need iron
trna transfers proteins mrna sends instructions to other proteins
it attaches to trna
when the mrna leaves the nucleaus it is sent to the ribosomes which start producing the dna next the dna is unzipped and the genes are replicated once this process is done the dna is produced
1 the mrna gets the information2 then it takes it to the trna3 then the trna transfers the mrna
1 you have to have a code to find the codon2 you have to use the condon to find where you start at3 then after you get the codon where you start it should be making a code with augct4 after you find where you stop at you should figure out what it says

they make new protiens
dna where is stores information trna where it transcribes protein synthesis mrna where it sends information
leaves the nucleus goes to the golgi apparatus then gets made into a protein then leaves through the cell wall
protein enters the bloodstream enters the nucleus of cells protein develops and spreads throughout the body makes the body stronger
the mrna leaves the nucleus and tells the other rna the blueprints to build protein the trna then starts building the right codon structure to make some with amino acids
it leaves the nucleus for amino acid sequence of a protein
protiens leavetravel down to the mebraneonce they get to the mebrane they then bondand connect
it goes from mrna to trna ro rrna to rna
once mrna leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm from there the trna comes into play and then it goes on to form a ploypeptide chain after all of that protein synthesis is complete
the mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomesribosomes make the poteins needed and sends them off to the mitochondria to send around the cell
carbs
mrna attaches to protiens which go to the ribosomes there the mrna turned into trna each trna gets an antibody that codes for dna once they code the left over protien is shipped out of the cell and the cycle starts over again
phosphateryboisamino acids
dna creates aa which form to make protiens
after leaving the nucleus mrna travels through the cell to the golgi apparatus after that it goes to the er  then it travels to the golgi apparatus again finally it exits the cell
trnarrnaremovement of unwanted proteinsthe mrna leaves the nucleus to send instructions to other cells
when the mrna leaves the nucles it travels to the mitochondria to code for the proteins that need to be made
the mrna is translated by trnatrna is brought to the ribosomestrna is used with rrna inside ribosomesprotiens are formed by rrna
the midrocondrien will store the protien and make sythesis out of the given nutriens then it will have the rna make a structure for the body to use as energy
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome after that the ribosme reads the mrna code then the complimentary trna with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mrna strand peptide bonds are put inbetween the amino acids and it folds up in a certain way to make a protein
1 trna transfers the rna2 it carried throughout the body3 it is made in to a protein that we can us4 the protein is used in the body
1 ribosomes2 message is transfered3 carried to nucleus4 protein synthesis
mrnatrnarrnaand rna
mrnarrnatrnagrna
mrna leaves the nucleusmrna broken down into strandsmrna decoded and recoded into amino acidsmrna creates proteins
from the mrnas transcription of the dna it is transported to the ribosomes where rrna combines with mrnathen mrna and rrna create more ribosomes in which they produce proteinsanother rna called trna is used to transcribed the amino acid sequence to proteins trna also helps to check the sequnece for any mistakes of the nitrogen base pairing
it may be that dna is going to take place
the mrna leaves the nucleus goes to get coded into amino acids then the amino acids are made into polypeptide chains then the polypeptide chains are made into proteins
mrna arrives at the ribosomes with the copied dna and unzips it the mrna bonds with other free nucleotides to make a new dna sequencetrna goes and retrieves amino acids and brings them back to the new dna in the ribosomesthe amino acids link together to form a chainproteins that leave the ribosome and the cell to perform their funtion
it heads to the michorndia  where the protein is produced then it heads to the golgi appartes to package the protein and it ships it to the er where it is shiped though the body then dna spends messages back to the mrna to make more proteins
1mrna will go to the rer2then it moves into a ribisome3next mrna moves into a vessicle4finally in fusses into the cell
prophase anaphasetelephase metaphase
the mrna would unzip then go through the ribisome after that it transport into trna
the nucleuas sends out the mrna to the er and then it goes to the rrna and tells the ribosomes what to do after that then it goes to trna and the proteins are produced
cytokinesis the cytoplasm dividesg1 the protein replicatesg2 the protein dividesinterphase this is where the protein spends most of its time
interphaseanaphasemetaphaseprophase
the nucleus makes mrna which stands for that retains the blueprints then it takes it to get assembled to make a protein  then it combines with the amino acids  then last it makes copys of more protein
trna transfers information to the dna rrna grna rna multiplies
trnarrnagrna
interphase metahase anaphaase prophase
1 get the protien2 make sure it get safely to the place where the organism needs it3 consume the protien4 keep it there and come stronger
the mrna sends the genetic code to trna then the trna takes the genetic code to the ribosomes the ribosome receives the genetic information and gets help from another mrna the ribosome with the help of mrna uses the information to construct the protein that was coded for in the genetic information
mrna leads to trna and rrna and then the final step which is either translocation or translation
the mrna travels to through the cytoplasm to the midocondrion and it copies itself to trna the trna goes and copies itself to the rrna and it sends the instructions to ribosomes and the midocondrion these instructions make the protiens
one step is metaphasesome others are prophaseantiphase and interphase
in protein synthesis the nucleus controls what happens in the cell  proteins are carried out by rna and the site of protein synthesis is rer
well the organism is going to get sick but then get really healthy
mrna leves the nucleus
mrna is translated from dnadna is what makes up mrnatrna transforms mrna into amino acidsrrna copies the tranafer rnd
mrna gos to the mitochondria annd then turns into trna and go to the nucleus then turns into rrna then makes the code for protein
after rna leaves the cell then begines to produce more so when the rna is converted into protien the body will have an almost constant supply
the mrna is translated into trna then its sent to the mitochondria to be coded then goes to ribosomes
then th protein start to reproduce
the mrna makes protiens and sends it smowhere else
1looses the nucleus
the first step would have to be building of bones and other body parts in the body the second step would be protecting from viruses the third step would be building a proactive life span and the fourth step would be keeping the body safe and healthy
1 the mrna attaches to a ribosome because protein synthiesis takes place in the ribosome2 corresponding trna attaches to the mrna where the nitrogenous bases match up3 these nitrogenous bases code for an amino acid4 a protein is formed by a strain of amino acids joined by petide bonds
it has to change to trna then it has to find the amino acids and then it has to come up with the right proteins
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna collects amino acids to create a sequence3 the sequence is coded by the trna4 proteins are made
kingdom species genus family
anaphase intrephase prophase and metaphase
after mrna leaves with information it then takes it to trna after this is done trna is helping produce atp for protiens after this process is done rrna comes in rrna is later fixing together the protiens
the mrna then goes and takes the nformation outside of the nucleus then the message that the mrna is carrying gets put in with a dna sequence this dna sequence is what is used to make copies of the dna
the four major steps that  are involved in protein synthsis is after leaving the nucleus it gets read  after that it gets copied and creates a new strand of dna
mrna leaves the nucleus and travels out into the cell collectin lysosomes and brings them back into the nucleus where the lyssomes get proccessed into proteins and the process repeats
transcriptiontranslation
mrna leaves the nucleus and carries to the mitochondria after that the mrna transfers the information to trna which then changes the information back to dna to place on the mitochondria to make a protein
breacking them down op
1 protein spreads throughtout the body     2 the proteins aid the development3 they supply the energy source4 need to be reproduced to maintain the source
the mrna travels to the the ribosome when attached to the ribosome it aquires an enzyme that lets trna to attach the trna attches and releases an amino acid when enough amino acids are together a protein is produed
interphase metaphase anaphasetelophase they all work together in a group in oder
1mrna leaves the nucleus2mrna attaches to the ribosomes3ribosomes translate message from the mrna4ribosomes produce proteins
the mrna sends messages through the nucleus then the mucleus starts doing its job therefore the body gets what it needs
first it is moved from the nucleus the mrna is transcribed  then it is translated  then it is trascoded
when mrna leaves the nucleus and goes with a message transport it
after the mrna leaves the nucleas the four major steps are processing the dna then the trna coming our and starting the replications process then the final step of dna is happening
1 mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the free ribosomes2 trna carrying the anticodon bonds to the mrna codon in the ribosome3 new amino acids are formed by the bonding of the codon and the anticodon 4 the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins
mrna leaves the nucleus proteins evolve from amino acids
the mrna transports the information to the ribosomenext the ribosome takes the mrna with the info and starts to produce the protienafter that the ribosome created an amino acid sequence to produce the protienfinally the protien is produced from the amino acid sequence  and is shipped to different parts of the cell so the cell can function properly
1 mrna the goes to the trna 2 the mrna strand is read3 the amino acids that make up the mrna take its place4 the amino acids make up the protien
trnamrnarrnadrna
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribosomes where a protein attaches forming trna
mrna will attach itself to a protienthis will then combine and make a strandtrna will then transfer the needed material to the protein
after leaving the neucleus the mrna carries the information to the amino acids for the sequence of proteins then it goes through trna and then rrna
four major steps are messager leaving the rna
after mrna leaves the nucleus protine synthesis involves amino acid sequence trna rrna and grna
trna rrna grna
mrna should go away forever
mrna will come into contact with dna and begin to insert itself into the dna and make a bopy of itself in it afterwards it will remove itself and move on to another dna strand
it moves on to oher placeto a nither nucleusbuild more mrnastart new life
after mrna leaves the nucleus the codons are translated to trna and are translated into dna
it leaves the nucleous then it in enters a ribsome thn it is copyed then it has been made
anaphaseinterphase metaphase and telophas are the four major steps involved in protein synthesis the steps all involve in mrna leaving the nucleus and than create other cells
breadlettuceburgerbread
the 4 steps are to first get the nutrients out then secondly get the protien out of it then start to move it threw the cell then get rid of it
transcription the mrna strand is changed to the new lettering sequencetranslation the new sequence is decoded and used to find the amino acid
goes to the golgi apparatus then the endo plasmic ritculam and then leaves the nucleus
the mrna leaves the cell and heads toward a ribosome  it enters the ribosome and the ribosome brings the correct amino acidsthe amino acids are place in their correct posistion on the forming proteinthe protein is formed and sent out to do its specified job
four major steps are the mrna is taked from the necleus then it is taken where it is needed in the body the body uses it then it is taken away
mrna leaves the nucleus and carries instructions for the amino acid sequence of the protein to the er then trna transports the things to the golgi where its packaged and distrubuted by rrna
the mrna leaves the nucleus it is then translated meaning it is read then it is transcripted so that it can be used for whatever it is needed then it is finally turned into rrna
mrna carries instructions for the amino acid sequencetranslation occurs to the strand of dnatranscription occur to the dnaa rna strand is coded of the dna strand
mrna leaves the nucleus and the eventually develops into trna and rrna  it then absords and develops proteins
ribasomes
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to the endoplasmic reticullum to send the information for protein synthesis all over the cell
1 mrna is paired up 2 trna carries amino acid sequences to the ribosome 3 a condon is made  4 the ribosome attaches to the sequence
mrna gets a message and leaves the nucleusstarts to travel up to the braingets to the brain tells it the messagethe brain starts to do what the mrna told it to do
its sent to the endoplasmic reticulum which sends it to the roughg version then to mitochondria then to ribosomes
dna replication where the informationdna is copied identically trna sends information needed to complete protein sythestis the  amino acids are converted into new codons the codons pair with their anti codons
prophase anaphase interphase and metophase are the four major steps
growth expand divide new
first the mrna must identify the protein needed for protein synthesis the mrna then travels to the mitochondria the mitochondria will then begin to produce the new protein that is needed the mrna will then turn into trna after leaving the mitochondria to travel back to the nucleus for gentic purposes
it goes through the organisms and leads through the process
when mrna leaves the nucleus it is then coded through transcription and then transfered to another cell to have the blueprint copied and translated through translation
four major steps that are involved in protien synthesis are fermentationlactic acidtransfusionand transduction
mrna goes to the ribosome where it hands trna the code for the protein trna then travels a gets the needed code after that it goes back to the ribosome where it hands of the supplies and gets another code

after mrna leaves the nucleus respiration occurs after respiration transcription beings and in transcription mrna is copied next translation occurs and translation is the procces where mrna is taken to the nucleus
memabrain nucleuscarbon dioxideoxygenphotosynthesis
mrna sends out instructions to the amino acids to produce proteins
after mrna leaves trna helps translate into protein then the protein gathers energy and finaly starts reproducing the other major steps are
1 the mrna goes to the ribosome2 the ribosome attaches to the mrna3 the trna comes and attaches to the mrna to begin protein synthesis4 protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop
1 takes the mrna to the cytoplasm 2 it then splits to opposite sides3 replicates itself4 match the acids together to make a new protein strand
the rna divides into mrna and then the mrna goes out and gives coded instructions to the organelles
trna mrna rna drna
step 1 mrna has to be changed into rrnastep 2 one of the strands have to leave and another hooks onstep 3 the strand binds togetherstep 4 the strand goes to do its work
the mrna leaves the nucleus the rna is then copied the new strands are made the new dna is shipped out
the first thhing it does is travel the next is i dont know the third is that they give proteins
transcriptiontranslation
the mrna sends a message with the amino acid sequence to ribosomes telling it to make protein then the trna transports enzymes to be converted  rrna then makes the protein
1 mrna travels to the ribosomes2 trna creates codons from anticodons3 rrna inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4 amino acids link together and form a protein
they unzipthey copy the informationthey rezip they have now made two copies of the information
once mrna leaves the nucleus these four major steps are involved in protein synthesis1ribosomes or rrna attach to the strand of mrna2trna transport ribonucleic acid attaches to the mrna with a specific anticodon holding a special amino acid for that mrna sequence3once one anticodon is attached that trna releases itself from the mrna for only one trna can be on at a time4once the new protein is formed the ribosomes lets go of the mrna and release the newly formed protein into the cytoplasm of the cell
the mrna leaves the nuclus and then it gos to the trna and the trna goes and gets the dna and goes to the ribosome to make protien for the for the rna
trna transfers the mrnarna changes into rnadna links with dnadna strand dna strand is created
the mrna sends a message to the rna to begin protein synthesis
mrna tranfers like a messenger to trna
the messenger rna leaves the nucleus then it travels to the ribosomes while traveling rna goes to the ribosomes and they make a protein
prophase metaphase anaphase interphase
the mrna gives directions to the protiens to tell them which codesthen they start connecting to the right matchthey then break off until the stop code then they make a strand that then becomes protien
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 then the rrna helps the proteins break down3 the trna transports the proteins to and from cells4 cell walls allow the protein inside for use
mrna leaves the nucleus proteins are brought to the golgi body golgi body sends the proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum er synthesises the proteins
when mrna leaves the nucleus then mrna will go to a different cell to do reproduction   also when it leaves it will go to other cells to do cellular activities it will go to a different section of the cell and produce enzymes and it will also go to another section of the cell to produce proteins
carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acids sequence of a protein
1 the mrna goes and attaches to a ribosome2 it will tell it to do something such as move or stay3 it will make another mrna molecule on that4 it will go back and get another message
anaphase metaphase prophase and telophase
1mrna leaves the nucleus2mrna gives the instuctions to the trna3trna carries the instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid4grna gets the instructions and makes the protein
transcription occurs then translation takes place then transfer rna decodes and sends the information to have rrna take place
the mrna enters the ribosome and the trna transcibes the instructions than rrna retreive the proteins needed
the mrna is cut in to one strand then the mrna is copied then amino acids from to the strand
first the protein is made then it forms  after it forms then it starts to make the protein  at last it is fully functional
trna carries instructions from nucleusgrna follows the instructionsrrna goes back to the nucleus
the mrna goes into the ribosome and transcription occurs when this occurs an enzyme
mrna hooks up with trna

the mrna  gets copyed into rnathen it transferces they it gets group by the amion acids into codonshow then take to make the things it is needed to do
translation transcription cellular respiration
1 nucleus2 endoplasm3golgi body4 cell membrane
after mrna leaves the nucleus it goes into the ribosomes where it is first used to create trna the ribosome then uses this trna to fetch the appropriate amino acids from the cell as specified by the rnas sequence after returning these amino acids to the ribosome the ribosome pieces together the protein that the rna specified with the amino acids finally the protein is released and used for whatever it is intended to be used for
for this process the mrna switches over                                    now it becomes  trna                                                               which carries instuctions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence of protein
mrna takes the transcribed code from dna to find a ribosome once the ribosome is found the trna reads the stranscribed code this is called translation after the code is read the ribosomes send off the code to begin making proteins now begins the step of protein synthesis
mrnamessenger rna leaves the nucleus and delivers genetic information to the amino acid sequence in protein trna tranfers the information the information is transcribed then rrna repeats the sequence
four ways are leaving to go to rrna disolving
transcription and translation is what happens
1mrna leaves the nucleus2 it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum3 it travels through the golgi body4 finally it gets the correct codon sequences it needs to form
trna transfer rna takes the mrna and puts it where it needs to go then some type of rna tells the cell membrane what to dothen the mrna is used to duplicate in the cell membrane
amino takes proteins to get them read porteins carry thing to differnt organsthere to help body funtions
it goes to the ribosome and gives the instrutions on how to make the dna
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 mrna changes into trna3
the four steps are
step one  the membrane og the synthesis past the cell up but the nucleus powers it the microdria pushs everthing threw and for the amino acids sequence of the protein

1 dna which is the body making its red blood cells2 rna which is the body making its white blood cells3 mna which is the body making its brains certain cells
mrna leaves the nucleus carries the codes for the codon the complementary strands unwind and you have two strands
trnamrnagrna
after leaving the nucleus enter the golgi aparatus then through the ribosimes next pass the mitochondria finaly out the central vacule
starting with the mrna leaving the nucleus afterwards the messenger rna will then go back to the dna to give the new strands copied information the dna will then copy the information then re create a new strand for the messenger rna to take back to the nucleus and bring back a new strand of copied information
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it then goes into the cytoplasm where it turns into trna the trna then has the codon which codes for the amino acid from the amino acid it then goes through protein synthesis
the mrna leaves the nucleaus and then carries the information to the er where it is turned into trna then the trna transcribes the information so that the ribosomes can make new ones
1 the first step is when the mrna releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm2 next the cytoplasm that has the mrna in it will attach to a ribosome3 that ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid4 this will continue until it reaches a stop codon
trna mrna rrna and grna
1mrna delivers the information to the nucleus2trna gives the directions3the rna forms protein4process starts over
1 after the mrna leaves the nucleus it brings it to the mitocondria2 where the mrna goes thats were it matches its end to another end to make itself into a product that will make a protein3 making the protein once the mrna finds out what it will make it turns into trna and makes the protein and that protein is sent out into the body4 replication the protein replicates itself to make many more proteins so that they body has everything that it needs
it carrys a copy of the dna strand to the ribosomeit matches up with its partner releases amino acids then stops at a stop codon after the process get there and brakes of making protein
once mrna leaves the nucleus they send the sequence to move on to the mitochondria where translation takes place the translation will take the mrna and change into trna for example if you have uau gcu then the new strand in trna would be aua cga after this then the strands will form the amino acids then you got the amino acids needed for energy and protein synthesis
first the mrna leaves the nucleus to go to the dna then it copies one strand of the dna then it makes ribosomes to translate it the codons get turned into amino acid and ribosomes attatch to groups of 3 amino acids to translate them after they are done they release and continue
the first step is for messanger rna to leave the nuclues after it has done this it goes to a trna that links to it and copies its opposite protiens then the trna is linked to by codons wich forms the code for the protiens then the newly formed protiens are sent to where they will be needed
protein synthesis helps the body to function it helps to build the body stronger it makes the body feel refreshed protein synthesis is very important to have
mrna leaves the nucleus it finds a ribosome within the cytoplasm to produce the proteins needed the mrna is fed through the ribosome passing off the appropriate information that codes for the necessary amino acids then the ribosome produces the amino acids
massenger rna travels to the cell membranethen it travels throught and stops at the cell membranenext it travels to meet up with dnaand it ends up connected to the dna
the mrna is instructed to tell the ribosome to make more proteinsthe ribosome makes proteinsproteins are delivered throughout the body the are transported on the cell membrane
anaphaseinterphasemetaphaseprophase
first you have to show that the protein is alive
first i has to be coppied and then it is looked over to make sure that there are no mistakesin the coppy next it goes to the new cell and that is all
rna
with proteins they are able to give you the needed amount of energy
protein going through out the body and then protein leaving the body which you need more protein everyday
1 the mrna will now travel to the rough endoplasmic reticulum2 now it will move into a ribosome3 next the mrna will travel to a vesicle4 last it will fuse with the cell membrane so that it can leave the cell
the nucleus must recieve new information it must use it adapt to it and then produce it
mrna picks up a codon and takes it back to the proteinmrna finds the codon that matches with its ownmrna connect the two codonsthe amino acid is formed
mrna tells the oraganelles what to do to help the cell with reproducing it would involve replicating and dividing the cell to become two cells
dnarna translaion trnaprotein
the rna links with ribosomestrna looks for anticodons to links with mrnaprotein link the trna and mrna togethera new strand of rna is created and breaks off the protein
it then goes to the golgi apparatus
the mrna is the messenger so it sends the message to other parts of the cell then transcription occurs then trna occurs and this is where it carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence of a protein
four major steps that are involved in protein syntensis aremrna leaves the nucleusthe mrna moves through the cell and buddys up with trna the trna is now transferred to the plasma membranethe plasma membrane makes proteins
metaphase the proteins meet in the middleanaphase the proteins multiplutelophase the cells begin to seperatecytokineses the cell begins to start the process again
mrna leaves the nucleus the body starts another cycle another mrna is produced mrna leaves the cell
after mrna leaves the nucleus it pairs up with another strand comtaining the opposite nucleotides this dna strand considered trna then attaches to a protein to code for an amino acid the amino acid stays attached to the protein
trna receive the messager mrna trna then start producing protein and then goes thought grnathe protein then goes though sythesiswhich then is creates protein synthesis
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2mrna starts to retrieve new proteins3mrna puts new proteins together4mrna put the new strand of rna together and sends the protein out to where its needed
the mrna changes into trna or grna or it will change into rrna  transfer rna helps transfer things etc
four major steps
mrna leaves the nucleus but is transported to the mitochondriathe mitochondria has trna send a messages to the nucleus once the message is received the rrna performs the functionthen it repeats starting back with the mrna
when mrna leaves the nuclues it is taken to the cyltoplaism from there trna reads codons or 3 bases at a time after reading the codons it gets the right amino acids the amino acids then make the right proteins
mrna is the messengertrna transports the rnarrna relicates the rnaprotien synthesis is the product after the process
transcription the mrna leaves the nucleus goes into the cytoplasm and finds the ribosomesinitiation part of the mrna fuses with the ribosomes telling the ribosomes to begin prtein synthesiselongation the ribosomes forms the proteins it eventually gets made into peptide chains and during this step the proteins add on to the peptide chain making it growtermination the mrna tells the ribosome to stop and the protein synthesis cycle is ended
we get more healthy no deaths more nutrients no diseases
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are recreation bounding healing and protecting
mutation making another cell just alike replication copying cellscrossing over exiting the cell to enter another cellimbedding entering a new cell
the mrna turns in to rna which is the transfered to the nucleus from there the rna turns in to dna as we know it
it leaves and it creates more mrnas and that helps your body and then it repeats the process again and it sends messages to the nucleus
the mrna brings the codes to the organelles that produce protein it drops off the codes and the proteins are made the trna leaves and goes to the nucleus to copy the codes again through transcription
protein synthesis has four major steps which are the mrna leaves the nucleus then makes the protein into a smaller strand and the trna takes it to where the rna is and passes it off to the rna then the rna takes the protein to where they can read it
the mrna is sending a message for the protein to be produced then the protein is carried off by the trna to other organelles th the protein is synthesized and finally the protein is made usable for the body
after the mrna leave the nucleus it goes off into the cytoplasm and proteins connect to the mrna strand after this happens they convert the mrna to amino acids and it goes down the strand one by one till it reaches the stop codon after this point it gets copied into a rrna strand lastly it then gets carried to other places in the body that need to know the rna combinations so they can make dna in the next cell with mitosis occurs
then it gets sorted and it brings rna back
mrna leaves the nucleus and then goes out to find a protein molecule then it attaches itself to the protein molecule and sucks some protein from it and then returns to the nucleus
anaphase metaphase telophase prophase
1trna takes the message to the codons to form a new strand2the new strand is made by the trna getting codes from the dna3the codons then are matched up and the new protein is one long strand4it is then put in a chamber where it is folded to the shape it needs to be in to carry out its function
the mrna will take the codes for the protein to the trna the trna will transfer it to the rrna which will take it to the ribosomes the ribosomes finish the process of protein synthesis and when it is done there one has a new protein
it then enters the ribosome in which it meets the trna and is then creating an even bigger strain of nucleic acid
after mrna leaves the nucleus the nucleus disappears this stage is also called prophase the next step is when the rrna takes the ribosomes to the golgi bodies to be packages and send throughout the body to help in certain spots the third stage is when trna is placed together to help make more ribosomes
the mrna sends the protein to trna trna sends the protein to the mitochondria the mitochondria uses the protein for energy our bodies use that energy
trna
it copies the mrna and makes it trna which then it copies and makes another identical strand without using the letter t
the mrna goes to the ribosomes then it sends signals up up to the anticodons it then reads them and sends singnals down to the amino acids the then connect together with peptide bonds and form a protein molelcule
the knowing of dna the knowing of the secondary mrna knowing biology and knowing what it does
mrnarrnagrnaand trna
mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome where an adhesive is placed on it it then travels to the golgi apparatus where it is added to a corresponding strand of rna to make dna the dna is used for reproduction
1 mrna goes to
prophasemetaphaseanaphasetelophase
the protien goes threw the nucleus and leaves the cell in order to go get what ever the cell needs to live
they reproduce with photosithesis
the mrna goes through the gogli appartis endoplasmic reticulum
trna rrna dna
transcriptiontrasnlocationgene expressiondna synthesis
the mrna leaves the nucleas  it then captures a protein  it brings the protein to this place where dna is made  it uses the protein to make the dna
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through pmat1 prophase2 metaphase3 anaphase4 telephase
the mrna goes to the ribosome the trna transfers the copyied strip and it goes through amino acids and is copyied
first the cell starts by separating a piece of dna that will be used as a template for the protein synthesis  then a mrna will find the corresponding piece to the nucleotide  next comes a trna which gets the corresponding piece to the nucleotide  this then carries it to the strand  once all the pieces are brought together to form the protein it will be put together by a rrna
trna links up with a proteinmrna goes through the protein and gets decodedrrna takes the decoded strand to the golgi aparatus and start the protein synthesis
the mrna in the messenger rna  it tells things what do to  four major steps invloved in protein synthesis are it makes protiens tells them what to do tells them where to go and it controls everything it is very helpful to protein synthesis
the first step involved with protien synthesis is activation mrna must activate the hormone that starts replication the second step is the hormone helicase dividing the two strands of dna to be read the third step is replication dna polymerase replicates the dna by matching the codons with the anticodon making rna the forth and final step is rezipping the dna strand into one uninteruppted strand
transcriptionmrna is transcribed into trnatranslationthe trna is then translated into what protien the cell needs to makethen the trna is used to help make the new protienthe protien is now made and the cell can use it for its benefit
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome which is where the proteins are made picks them up and brings them back to the nucleus
the golgi body sends out the dna the mitrocondria is the power house
it helps the body in matining strong muscles
protein sythesis starts with mrna and goes through the krebbs cycle the calvin cycle then the electron transport chain and ends with 38 atp
in protien synthesis the mrna leaves the cell then ribosomes attach to the strand and then anticodons start to attach and  break of as the ribosome continues down the strand of mrna in the end when the ribosome finds the stop codon the protien strand breaks off
the messager rna tells the other rnh what to do
translation translates the message from the nucleus to help rna complete tasksrna processing to make the rna so it can acomplish its tasksribosomal amino acid sequencing sequence of ribosomes to break down amino acids

trna     rrnagrnamrna
the mrna copies its self exactly then those change themselves with a special codon along with amino acids
protein synthesis involves for major steps  sunlight is needed sugar is needed carbon dioxide is needed but energy is needed as well  protein synthesis is a very complicated process
the mrna leaves the nucleus to transfer a message to the trna the trna transfers all the protiens into there new form then telophase changes them back and gives them each a condon finally the dna is complete
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus with the codon information2 it takes it to the ribosome to make an anticodon3 the anticodon heads back to the nucleus to take the protien and amino acid that the dna needs4 the trna anticodon conects with the codon
1 the nucleus2 the membrane3 the cyoplasm4 the cellwall
the mrna then goes and transfers the message to the ribosomesthe ribosomes begin their task of creating proteins and proteins are creatednext the ribosomes cleanse the proteinsnow the proteins are synthesized
heals protects kills bad organisms and leaves it
the nucloetides leave the nucleous and make more protein then the nucloetides enter the nucleous into dna and transports the codons to the anticodons

interphase anaphase telophase metaphase epicphasednanucleus cellsequence
interphase anaphase telephase prophase
1  the mrna travels to the ribosomes2  trna contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it  it goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes  3  the anticodon is bonded to the codon4  the amino acids are bonded together to make proteins
protein synthesis involves mrna which sends messages and trna which is transfer rna
the mrna acts as a template to make give to the translation rna and the trna moves to the ribosomes attaches to a corresponding sequence and then the proteins are made in the ribosome
the mrna leaves and transfers into trna because mrna is the messenger rna the trna holds the information
mrna leaves the nucliusgoes to the mitochondria
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase are all major steps involved in protein synthesis
mrna leaves the nucleus in a single strandthen gets the the ribisome becmoing rrna there it waits to be sinthisedtrna comes and matces up the nucleotidesthus creating amino acids
aauaaatauuuu
transfusiondefusion
the mrna leaves the nucleus and heads directly to the ribosome where the ribosome matches the codons to their complementry base pairs the amino acids on the ends of the trna are linked to gether by polypeptide chains and soon a stop codon cuts off the amino acids making a protien
exitingtravelingarrivingreturning
mrna leave the nucleus the mrna find its start codonit puts in its matching letter the message its carrying through the enzymes that surround itthen it puts it into codons sets of 3 and codes for the amino acid creating a polypeptide chain or protein
the mrna comes out of the cell and to protein then changes the rna strand to an mrna strand and makes proteins from there
1 the mrna enters into the dna and creates a copy of it2 then the mrna gives off information to the trna 3
mrna to rrna to trna
dna translates into the rna
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome at the ribosome the trna comes and matchs the codons with anticodons when the anticodons have been set on the codons the trna then brings over the amino acids that match the codons or anticodons they are then held together by a peptide bond
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it finds a portion of dna and uses an enzyme to unzip it the mrna then copies the bases of the dna to form a new strand of rna when the new rna is made its nucleotides code for amino acids so it attaches to an codon which makes the amino acids which form protiens
after the mrna leaves the nucleus trna translates the coded message the mrna has been carrying then proceding to give the rrna the instructions and thus the end result is the ribosomalrna completes protein synthesis and the process starts over again
replicate its dna and then ship it away to be replicated in a different way creating rna
the cell takes in oxygen then it takes in water it moves across the cell membrane to get protein that it needs to continue the growth process
in mrna there are four major steps and they are messanger whih is mrnatransfer which is trnarrna and grna
the trna then takes the protein to the cell
it gets the dna transports it to be copied taken do nucleus and then taken to its destianation
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it brings the direction to the ribosmos wich then lines up amino acids  in codon and each three leteer codon equal one protein
decomposition
they are trna nrna
anaphase metaphase telaphase they keep repeating these steps plus one more step
one process is cell divison which divids the cells up
the mrna leaves the nucleus  the mrna gets the information from the nucleus the mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid chain then it goes to the ribosomes to find the amino acid to attach itself to it continues the cycle until it ends up with a stop codon then you have a protein
mrna leaves the nucleus
the mrna leaves the nucleus
protons nutrons and electrons
the mrna picks up the copy of the dna segment that it needs to bring to be transferedthe mrna takes the dna segment to the ribosomesthe dna strand is translated in the by the trnathe different protiens represented by the translated dna strand are made and linked together to form a protien chain
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus where it is transfered into the cytoplasm where the trna picks it up2 the trna isalredy caryyimg the matching anticodons and then it attaches to the amino acids 3the trna travels to the site odf protein synthesis which would be the ribosomes4 once at the ribosome the trna finds its matching sstrand and then binds with itthis then produces protein
the steps are the enzymes leave the nucleus gets smaller the rybosomes get rid of waist and the rybonuclaic acid eats away the nucleus
guanine thymine adicine jadine
the four major parts of protein synthesis are rrna trna mrna grna the mrna carries instructions from the necleous for the amino acid sequence of a protein all these steps put together allows protein synthesis to occur

1 after the mrna leaves the nucleus it contacts the trna to transfer information 2 the information is then carried on by rrna3 when the rnas are done they get together to form a protein4 thats when protein synthesis is formed
mrnatrnagrnarrna
from mrna it travels to trna which carries them to the amino acids and then to the ribosomes which make proteins
you could not live with out it
then mrna travels to where the amino acid sequences are being made then it is coped using trna and made into a serparate strand using rrna
when mrna leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm which attaches to the amino acid chain which goes to the ribosomes and make  proteinsamino acids
the mrna carries instructions to the ribosome where synthesis will take place then trna takes the synthesised protein from the ribosome to the rrna who is the message and finishes the process
interphase telophase anaphase and prophase
anaphasemetaphaseprophaseinterphase
it leaves the nucleus and goes and attacts to cells and then it starts to multiply once it multiplies it involves protein synthesis
the next step after the mrna is the trna and that is the transer dna that holds the message that the dna gave the mrna after that is when the membrane get the information after that is when the body responds to that
mrna leaves the nucleusmrna travels to the endoplasmic reticulum
they go to the lips
it starts with mrna then it goes to rrna then trna then finally grna
1 leaving the nucles the protein has to go through the bloodstream2 through the blood stream the protein then goes to the nerves3 from the nerves it then goes to veins4 from the veins it then goes to the brain giving the brain the message it needs and the brain sends out everything it needs to send out
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 it travels to the amino acids with instructions of how to make a protein3 the trna is formed that will match a specific amino acid4 trna connects with a specific amino acid and a protein is formed
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it will carry the instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequencethen it will be transford to the ribosomes and it will become trna and it will be starting to make new data ande then it will become rrna
eating the right foodsdrinking wateractivityexercising
1 the messenger rna sends information to the transfer rna 2 the transfer rna relays the information to the ribosomal rna 3 the ribosomal rna attaches to other rna 4  an enzyme activates the manufacture of protiens between the rna molecules in the nucleolus

one getting energy to the nucleus to do this actiontwo getting the mrna to the cell membrane to preform this actionthree turn the energy into protein for the cell and bodyfour repeat it again
after leaving the nucleus the rna is copied the bases for rna are adenine uracil cytonine and guanine then the bases are read as a codon the codons are attached by amino acids finally the new rna strand is taken to the ribosomes to make proteins
the mrna gets transfered into trna the trna goes  and tell them what kind of protein to make and then the dna splits
mrna must travel to the ribosomesthen it must turn information into a readable secquence so that the t cells can read it
the first big step in protein synthesis is the mrna leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores the second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mrna next trna moves in and adds the anticodon to start making a protein the anticodons are joined by amino acids to finish the process a trna leaves and the ribosome moves down the mrna to the next codon a new trna brings a new anticodon
rna stand for ribo nucleicaciddna stand for dioxiribo nucleicacid

as it leaves the nucleaus it travels to the mitocondria then to the golgi apparaus and to the cell membrane divides
once the mrna leaves the nucleus it go to the ribosomes where protein will be made then the protein will make its way to the mitochondria where it will be transfered into energy the cell can use
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna travels through the cell3 the mrna reaches its destination4 the process starts all over again
when the mrna leaves the nucleous it is taking a copy of the dna to make more copies and create a protein as it leaves it goes into the ribosome where the protein synthesis and copying of the dna actually happens in the ribosome amino acids with the corresponding letters match up to the new copy of the dna stop codons are added to the end and a protein is now made
four major steps in protien synthesis are the chains such as the electron tranport chain the protiens copy themselves and create amino acids the chain will continue to make as many amino acids as necessary until it reaches the stop codon mrna is the type of rna that sends a message from the nucleus to the rna strand so it has directions of what and how to make protiens
after the mrna leave the nucleus there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis first a trna attaches to the strand of mrna the first codon of nucleotide bases on the mrna match the codon on the trna the trna codes for an amino acid next another trna connects to the next codon bringing in another amino acid the first trna floats away leaving the amino acid behind the amino acids bond this continues creating a strand of amino acids until a stop codon is reached then the chain of amino acids is released
rnadna proteintrait
copying dna dividing exiting the cell finding a new cell
the mrna takes the protein synthesis and sends it where its suppose to go
mrna is very important because it tells about the cells in your body
rna
mrna leaves the nucleus and heads over to the protein the proteins then connect to thier matches the mrna carries dna infromation to the ribosome then there is a protein
the nucliusthe memebrans and organells
step one is replication
the mrna then travels to a ribosome and attaches to it one of end of the mrna goes into the ribosome and trna attaches the corresponding nucleotides to the end once the mrna has been coded the corresponding rna is then copied again to get the correct sequence the newly made protein is then released from the ribosome
the mrna attaches to the dna strand the strand then unzips and trna attaches to the unziped dna strand it then copys the nucleotide segment after its done copying the nucleotides it goes back to the endoplasmic reticulm and proteins are then made there

there is transporting of proteinsalso proteins are checked and sent off proteins are sent back to the nucleus
cell mebrane
mrna leaves the nucleus then goes out and produces things with in the cell then is used to help the body and finally new ones are produced
one they copy the rna i do not know the rest
mrna finds trna and it decodes the mrna then trna goes to rrna and makes ribosomes
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 it then travels throughout the body 3 disperses  into your bodys systems 4 gets proteins to the body
once the mrna leaves the nucleus it has begins to go through transcription that occurs in the cytoplasm in transcription parts of the protein will be broken into chains so it cna be matched up later after it will go through translation where the mrna is translated into a polypeptidethe mrna will match up with one of the single stranded rna to make a new string of dna
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are 1 metaphase 2 anaphase3 prophase4 telophase
the mrna is the messanger rna there are three different types of rna mrna which is messanger rna trna which is transfer rna and rrna which creates ribosomes
mrna passes the nucleus to dna and dna makes it reproduce
step 1 they travel through the bodystep 2 they enter the spot they need to be step 3they get to the spot they need to be step 4they do the job
there is regular rna mrna trna and protein synthesis you just make the letters go to their opposites
the mrna goes to the ribsosomesthe ribsosomes make a templettrna finds the parts to make the protiensmrna goes with the ribsosomes to make the protiens
mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes and tells them to make proteins the ribosomes then start to create the proteins which are then transfered to the nucleus to be programmed for whatever they are needed for
mrna leaves the nucleus it then has to reproduce it splits to make a copy and then the mrna has to synthesis further to make protein synthesis complete
the mrna leaving the nucleus creates a structure for the proteins to leave the cell then the proteins leave the cell after this the cell works to make new proteins then the process keeps repeating
1 the mrna will take the genetic code to a ribosome2 trna comes to the ribosome and matches its codon with the respective codons of the mrna dropping one molecule of amino acid as it goes3 the amino acid collects forming a long string of amino acid4 the ribosome takes in the amino acid and creates protein
it goes threw all the cell parts before being defined
the mrna strand photosynthesises into a suitbale living condition for the body copies itself to make a new strand after it copies itself it removes bad parts of the strand and fills back up witht the copiesthen repeats the process
trnatranscribe mrna into dnagrna gather informationrrnamrnacarries insruction to the amino acid of a protein
first the mrna is told what to do and gets the code from trna and attends to itsecond the trna brings anticodons to the mrna third the process is slowed down and anticodons are brought to the mrna fourth the translation occurs and amino acids are linked together to form a new copy
the mrna sends a message to the nucleus the nucleus tells the cell to make proteins proteins are made it repeats these steps
protein synthesis has four steps that involve the mrna going from the nucleus to the ribosome and then going from the ribosome to the cell membrane and then to the cytoplasm
interfase is the longest phase in the cycle after interfase is prophase which is the first stade of meiosis the second stage is anaphase which the nucleus splits in two the last stage is metaphase then you have a new cell
first mrna goes to the lysosomessecond it copies into trnathird the trna gets codonsfinally the codons form proteins
1 it leaves the nucleus then it gos to where it needs to go2 then it seperates and makes brand new strands of what is needed3 it mutiplies really fast and then makes more and more of what is needed4 everthing that is needed is now made
mrnais the messanger which leaves the nucleus trna transfer information to the ribosome
telephasemetaphaseanaphase
the mrna delivers a code to the mitochondria then it translates the code into amino acids the amino acids are then put into specific codes based on what the mrna said
first the endoplasmic reticulum takes the protein and breaks it down  secondly the ribezomes compress what is left down  then the golgi apparatus takes it to the cell membrane   the cell membrane then takes it out of the cell
gathering protein needs to breath so it needs more room
mrna leaves the nucleus then it is copied into rrna and trna carrying an amino acid attatch to the nucleic acid in segments of three the trna attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein attatched to it and then body form between the amino acids as more trna come and once the bond forms between the amino acid the trna is let go by the end of the rna chain a long string of amino acids has been created

1 mrna leaves the cell it tells the enzyems which dna strand to work on2 an enzyme attaches to the dna strand3 the enzyme strats to decode the dna strand into complumentary rna4 the enzyme detaches and moves on
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it is taken to the ribosome by trna and it is made into proteins
1 the mrna tells the trna to get ready at the ribosome2 the trna goes and attaches the pairs together3 they keep attaching until it hits stop codon4 the protein is released
step one it finds a ribosome and is copiedstep two it leaves the ribosome and goes to the nucleousstep three i dont know
the mrna goes to the ribosome and gives the potien codes to the ribosomal rna
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 the genetic material is transcribed into rna form3 the genetic material is taken to the ribosomes4 protein synthesis occurs
it leaves goes to deliver informationgoes to the rrna and it reades the informationthen it makes a copyand that copy goes out and finds matches to go with
mrna leaves the nucleustrna startsgrna startsrrna starts 
the mrna leaves the nuclear membranedna copies itselfthe old dna dies
the mrna that was copied from the dna leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribosome where it is transcripted each codon codes for an amino acid the proteins are linked together as they are translated
cell tissue organ organ system
the mrna leaves the nucleus transporting information then the mrna travels to the cells membrane then the mrna drops off the information then goes back to the nucleus
the mrna is copied
it has to makes it past all the intruders it leaves the area it began it mutates it forms new cells
it needs to abtain more proein
the mrna leaves the nucleus with the transcribed dna which forms rna and takes it to the rrna which is the ribosomal rna the rrna takes it to trna to be read trna stands for transfer rna trna reads and changes the codons to amino acids
it goes to same place
making protein
protein synthesis consists of the building of amino acids then they link together forming a chainnext the chains attach togetherlastly they turn into the new rna
well you have the stop codon then i dont know the rest
it sends a message t othe cell that needs the protein then it sends it back to the brain to get that protein
the mrna is carried off into different parts in the whole protein synthesis by going down to where it will get carried off to make protein  then is will be taken to where it can get energy  after that it goes through a different phase and and the end it is carried to the end that makes protein
there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis one of them is replication the mrna cells must replicate in order to leave the cell next they must copy other cells after that they must duplicate lastly they will zip back together to make more copies
the mrna leaves the cell and goes into the cytoplasm of the cell then the codon and anticodon pairs up then the anticodon is released then onece it reaches a stop codon there is a chain of amino acids
rna
the first step is leaving the nucleus this step is important because the mrna goes through the nuclear pores to go to the cell the next step is sending the message through the cell
the mrna is read by the trna  then the trna must put on a cap and a tail so that it can move and it can keep the sequence in there  then it is read by the protein creating the amino acid
mrna instructs the protien
energystores foodprotects the cell and foodhelps it stay alive
in he nucleus dna replicates mrna comes and takes the dna into the cytoplam strands of dna sequence agtc comes into the amino acid in different strand each timenucleotides of agtc that have a bond with the strands come and bond together trna transfers it which makes a protein
mrna leaves the cell gives it to the trna then the trna travels and gives it to another cell to be translated and help the body healthy able to grow and have the body be able to repair itself
prokarytioc
the mrna decodes dna then takes the code to the cytoplasm then takes it to the ribosomes to produce function and then takes it to the trna to decode and produce protiens
diffusion mitosis meiosis and genetic diffusion
the mrna goes into the cytoplasm and experiences transcription which is the pairing of bases according to the mrna sequence then the full strand is split and both strands go to the ribosomes to be translated when the mrna strands arrive there translation will occur which means that trna will bring amino acids that code for a particular segment of the mrna will attach together a certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins
the mrna leaves and sends the trna to the dna the trna leaves amino acids in a chain onto the new dna the amino acids form together to make enzymes which form into protein
1 the mrna arrive to where the sequence will be decoded 2 the sequence will be decoded3 they will turn into amino acids sequence for protiens4 the amino acids will make protiens
the protein drops the amino acid which conect to the other amino acids to make a chain while the rna moves over and conects with the other piece of rna
trnamitosismeiosisanaphase
trna mitosis meosis osmosis
it goes to the nucleus and transports the message
mrna leaves the nucleus travels through the body and into the the brain
1 the dna unzips2 then it goes throught transription where it copies3 then it translates 4 then becomes a protien
they create more cells for the body when the cells get too big they break down into smallar size and keep on growing
the mrna first leaves the nucleus and enters into the cytoplasm second each trna carries one amino acid to the anticodons after this the trna helps to form polypeptide bonds between the amino acids the proteins continue to grow and bond until a stop codon is reached
water air sunlight soil photosynthesis
the protein must be copied by the nucles then it must be taken to each cell next the cell must carry out the function finally the process ends and starts all over again
the messenger rna tranfers information in protein synthesis it also uses the golgi apparatuss information to help it go where it needs to go
it then goes to the rna strand and sends the messagethen it leaves there and goes to the trna and sends the message which then the trna starts to make amino acidsthe amino acids then connect to make a peptide bondthen it starts over agian
they help clear out germsthey fight bactera that might harm the bodythey help your body get used to the germsthey save your life
it separtes the protein and copies it
mrna leaves the nucleus  by a small opening in the nucleus then it goes and finds the dna strand that is broken the mrna strand knows were it is going because the brainsent it a message to tell it where the broken dna strand is then it slids into places by slidding in between the two broken strands after it makes sure that everything is matched up and it joins together to make it a hole strand again
the mrna leaves the nucleus mrna tells the trna how to design the proteinthe trna to go get the peices and put them in the right places a protein is created
the mrna is replicated then passed through the a hole in the nucleus where it is read and coppied into dna after that the mrna is then transferred out of the cell trhough the cell membrane
mrna takes the message that it needs more proteins and makes sure that it gets to the ribosomes where the proteins are made the ribosomes start making proteins and when they are done send the proteins for their final packaging to the golgi apparatus the golgi polisheses and finishes the synthesis of the proteins and send them out in the cell where the are needed
when the mrna leaves the nucleus there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis first the mrna takes coded instructions to the nuclues after that the instructons are used to assemble the amino acids to the ribosomes this is taken by the trna the rrna completes the assembly finally the new strains of ribosomes can be used finishing protein synthesis
the mrna makes a copy of the dna and then brings it to the trna which brings it to the amino acid sequence making a new protein
once it leaves it goes to the next station where it will do its job to complete protein synthesis it has four major steps along the way  witch are all very important they all have very important jobs to do
its changes the dna
the mrna goes through the nuclear pores and delivers the message the message is then processed and the cells completes the task
trna moves proteins
telophasemetaphaseprophase interphase  i think i am not sure
you have the dna that is there that tells you everything about your bodyand the the water stuff that heklps you keep water and then you havwe the food thing and lah
mrna begin to duplicate the dna into an rna form this then creates another dna strand of course after being checked for errors and mutations in the end the dna connects up again after having to split for duplication
mrna carries protiens it helps produs
messenger rna collects the information it needs to copy dna then trna changes thymine to uracil two strands of rna are made
breaks down nutrients
ribosomes form proteinsmitochondria make proteins for energyproteins move through the cell membrane to the rest of the organism

anaphase interphasemetaphaseprophase
the dna unzips and the mrna comes in and then the dna gets a new code and if there is a mutism in there then that will happen then the mrna will unzip and the trna will get the code send it to the ribosome and then it will decode the code that the trna gave and send it back to the dna
the mrna goes to ribosomes that read itribosomes send a message to trnathe trna take take a amino acidconnecting them making a codon
first the mrna move through the cytoplasma to the ribosome then the trna take over by making another sidethen the trna take it to the ribosome to get cut by restiction enzymes then those peices get turned into pieces of protien
carbon dioxide hydrogen oxygenand nitrogen
mrna leaves the nucleus and seperates in half the half of the mrna gets copied and is sent to the new nucleus
the mrna ends up changing into a different protein
mrna leaves leaves the nucleus mrna carries the instruction to the mitocondriamitocondria then makes the protiensat last the mrna returns to the nucleus with the protiens
the mrna leaves the nucleus
the rna takes the sequence to the ribosomes to make protien
1 the trna attaches itself to the mrna2the mrna takes the trna to the line of nuleic acids3 the mrna detatches onto the line4 the trna attacthes a new ribosome to itself back to the nuleus to start over
the mrna is copied and then sent out by the ribosomes then goes through the endoplasmic reticioulm where it does its job
the 4 major steps in protein synthesis is that when mrna leaves the nucleus trna grna rgna start to do their jobs
mrna connects to the ribosomecodons read the letters then retrieve the correct amino acidthe amino acids are connnected to the mrna and taken into the ribosomein the ribosome the amino acids are used to make a protien
1messenger rnatranscribes 2transfer rnatransfers3break downs4makes them codons that can be made into proteins
translation transcription conversion
gives messages to the proteintranformingtranscibing then comes up with sequences for the type of amino acid
the strand of dna unzips and the mrna fills in one of the sides of the dna once the whole strand has been remade the mrna goes to other cells in the body contain that needed information
1 trna2mrna3rrna4dna
mitochondria
after mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cell into the cytoplasm then the codon comes and so do the amino acids next the mrna carries the instructions for the new sequence and codes for new dna
the mrna goes through the dividing wall and into the trna and into a section of the dna it then goes to the amino acids and create a protein
translation  moving out of the nucleus into the other parts of the cellfusion  rna moves to amino acidsreplication  copying the sequence to replicate the dnareaches stop codon  the stop codon stops the sequence from being replicated any further
1after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribsome where the trna is2when at the ribosomethe mrna transfers the data to the amino acid sequence in the trna3after transfering the data goes through protein chains fulled by atp 4after completing all the stepsthe protien is sent throught the body for energy
after mrna leaves the nucleus it is cut in half and the anticodons are read after that trna brings codons to bond with them the amino acid all chain together last thepolypeptide chain breaks away forming a protein
genetically changegentic disorderdifferent speciesmutation
the rna goes through a ventricle and makes atp
the mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes  at the ribosomes trna attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mrna  on the other side of the trna are the amino acid that the nucleotide sequence on the other side codes for  this happens continuously to make proteins
decodes ittakes it to trnatrna takes it to the ribosomesribosomes make protiens
the mrna give the sequence to the trna and then it enters the new cell and transfer the trna into dna
1 the mrna has to travel through the cell to get to were it can exit 2 the mrna has to deliever the proteins to were they need to go
mrna gives data to trna and then its turned into amino acids
mrna creates amino acidsthey are converted into codonsthey are then made into rrna they go about their job in the cell
the four major steps in protein synthesis  of mrna is the proteins transfer and build up into different groups another major step would be the loss of  nucleus a major step would have to be passing the dna through the cell to the nucleus the last major step would have to be the organells helping to pass the antibodies to fight infection
the mrna leaves the nucleus  the cells travel to a ribosome to make proteins  then the proteins travel to the mitochondia to make energy  then the cell leaves the mitochondia and makes it way to the amino acids
the proteins are made then carried by the ribsome and then released into the body to make energy
it first goes through mrna and attaches on the the mrna and waits for something to come then it drops off and it goes on to another strand of mrna
mrna changes in to rrna and goes out in the rest of the cell
the protein is eaten usued digested and flushed out
mrna leaves nucleustrna transfers proteins
mrna leavign the nucleaus the mrna attaches to the new protein then matches up the complemetary codons
the first major step is to find a ribsome next would be to attach to the ribsome after that trna goes and gets amino acids the last major step would be to make a long chain of amino acids and turn that into a protein
the mrna must leave the nucleus and travel through the cytoplasm the mrna must then converge with the different protein bases the proteins mix in the the mrna to create a strand the protein synthesis is made when the strand reaches the normal dna
first mrna takes the codes to the ribosome to make the proteins then the rrna codes for the proteins and makes them then the trna transfers the proteins back to the nucleus finally the proteins are released into the cytoplasm and the process begins again
one step involved in protein synthesis is the trna moving ribosomes  another step in protein synthesis is rrna making the proteins  another step is using the protein  another step is restarting the cycle
the body becomes colder
1 mrna gets read by an enzyme located in the robosomes2 mrna becomes trna3 traslation acoures trna got to the ribosoms and get an amino acid4 after this the dna repentes the same steps
the mrna departs to from the cell to the ribosomes and with instructions of how many and what types of proteins to make for the cell the mrna contains a sequence of what types of amino acids consist in the protein that is to be made
trnagrnarrna
chromosomes attachthey seperatenew nucleus is formedanother one is formed
annaphase prophase interphase and metaphase
the mrna leaves the nucleusthe mrna travels to the ribosomethe ribosome attaches to the mrnatrna attaches codons to the anticodons on the mrna
the mrna goes to the ribosomes at the ribosomes the mrna changes in to trna the trna leaves the ribosomes and goes to the golgi apparatus to be changed to protein the protein then gets sent to all parts of the body
the mrna goes out to the ribosome and attaches to trna then trna transfers the code into a useable code next segments are put together with bonds every three sections of the code bond to create an amino acid these amino acids bonded together create a protein then the protein is shipped to other organelles to be fixed and put in a useable form for the cell
it then goes to the trna the trna then transports it to the rrna the rrna the decodes it for the mrna
1 mrna leaves the neucleus2 mrna reads the dna3 the mrna tells the rrna4 the rrna makes the dna split
the rna leaves the nucleus and then sends codes to the dna telling it what its new match will be switching the as to us ts go with as gs with cs and visversa except the a will switch to a u instead of a t this is known as mrna then the mrna sends codes to the proteins telling what codon it will beexampledna atgtaccgtatgactmrna uacauggcauacugaafter rna happensamino acid tyr met technically you start with a met ala tyr stop
1 mrna goes to dna and get its molecules2 mrna take dna to trna3 trna copies it4 dna is transfered
the mrna goes to the ribosomes which then code for codons then taken to the amino acids sending it back to the nucleus to recreate new strands of dna
mrna splits up and meets with the nuclaic acid then it is combined with phosphate to create a protein
when mrna leaves the nucleus a trna molecule gets the anticodon and gives it to a rrna to make the codon and then gives it to the ribosomes to produce the protien
translation deletion translocation transformation
it goes to the ribosome and trna carrying a amino acid comes in and if the code matches then the amino acid stays and then this process continues until u get a stop codon the end result is the making of a proteine
1 the mrna settles on the endoplasmic reticulum2 the mrna finds a match of trna3 the two produce a chain of amino acids4 the chain of amino acids create a protein
first the mrna is sent from the nucleus and sent to the ribosomes than it is changed into trna after it is turned into trna it is sent to be turned into protein than when it is turned into a protein it is sent into the body to do its job
mrna leaves the nucleus and hooks up with another mrna then one of the strands breaks off and another trna strand hooks up with it
dna separates and an rna strand is paired with dna strandthe rna is taken to the ribosomethe rna is then changed to mrnathen the mrna is tranlated into trnaand then you have a strand of rna
the mrna leaves the nucleusit then is trna and is carried to where it will create the new cellthe mrna is transcribedthe mrna is now a new strand of rna
well the dna splits and makes copies of rna and then repeats the process
1 mrna leaves the nucleus with a pattern2 mrna goes to a ribosome3 trna comes and makes a complimetary strand4 rrna makes the amino acid sequence to create protein
the mrna is translated in to amino acidsthe  codons take their placeand the new sequence is finshed
1 trna reads the strand of mrna using anticodons2 trna retrieves amino acids3 the process continues until a stop codon is reached4 the newly formed polypeptide is released
they send messages out of the cell
sugars come in and out of the cell during proteinsynthesisthe immiune system build up stronger
prophasemetaphaseanaphasetelaphase
mrna leaves the nucleus it then goes to trna to translate itthen to rrna to recieve the message then it becomes synthesized
the mrna carries the instructions from the nucleus to the outside of the cell then to the trna the trna carries the instructions to the proteins for synthesis
1 dna is coped to rna2 rna exites the cell3 rna goes to the ribosomes4 ribosomes produse the gene matereal
1 mrna goes and connects with a trna2 the anti codons attach to its same sequence3 the anti codon and the codon make a protein4 the protein is matched with others and goes through the protein channel
protein synthesis    1 codon changes    2 reaction happens    3 new messanger    4 trna
the mrna scans the rna to find out what the complementary proteins are the trna brings the complementary strands the strands bond amino acids are made and go into the organelles the process repeats
telephase anaphase and metaphase
four major steps involed in portein synthesis are trascription when the strand od dna gets ripped apart then traslation when things occur in the nucleus
hydrogen bonds and dna segments
mrna has to leave the nucleus then it transfers information to trna after it does that it makes copies then lastly sends it back to mrna
mrna then heads to the ribosomes where it is transcribed using the codes to create amino acid strands which are connected a long enough chain of amino acids create proteins
it goes to the trna and transfers over to it then it flouts to the protein maker then it goes in the protein maker and then it becomes a protein
it takes the protein over to another organelle then the protein gets sent all over the cell they use it for energy and then they do it again
the information on the mrna is copied
your body used our proties to make energyit then uses that energy to make new protiens     then uses those protiens to create energytherefore helping you say healthy and have energy
the next step that is involved in protein synthesis would be after the mrna leaves the nucleus the trna sends instructions to the ribosomes in order to create the protein which is where the dna is then unzipped the codons are then attached with the one strand of dna once this has happend the amino acids then match up with their complementary bases to form the amino acid sequence in order to form a protein
in prophase the nuclear membrane begans to disappear  then in anaphase the chromosomes began to break apart and go to opposite poles  then in metaphase they chromosomes are at opposite poles  then the cell begans to break apart into two whole new cells
when mrna leaves the nucleus it transfers to trna then it makes amino acids then the amino acids make a peptide bond then the cycle repeats
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are transfering proteins to the cell membrane producing enzymesgetting energy from certain foods and digesting them
1 translation  the items are moved into a diferent order2 transformation  the items are changed into other sequences3 deletion  a certian pertion is deleted4 substitution  a certian amino acid is traded out for a different      one
the mrna moves out of the nucleus it is then moved to the cell membrane then it is copied down last the information acts like a blueprint as the thing needed is built
mrna sends messages out to specific places in the body to obtain materials that are needed for protein synthesistrna transfers important information to the nucleus to code for amino acid assemblyrrna begins the proteins needed for ribosomal constructionprna makes specific proteins and other materials that are needed for protein synthesis
1 mrna is transcribed into trna2 codons form in sections of 3 nucleotides with a stop codon at the end3 trna plugs into the codons and starts making the amino acids4 amino acids form into proteins

the protein are made by lysosomes then the protein travel to the endoplasmic reticulum they also take a stop in the golgi apparatus and then they also go into the mitochondria
translocation is moving the information translation is copying the information replication is making the copied information
1 water2 sun
first thing you want to do is get the mrna to the trna then from there the trna will transform into a cell now the cell depends on what the body is in need of
1 mrna is transported to the ribosomes2 rrna matches it with the amino acid that corresponds to form proteins
once mrna leaves the nucleus it changes size
molecules go to the goli apparatus wich then prepares them which then
as the mrna leaves the nuclear pore a rrna comes and aids the process the trna comes and has complementary codons to make a amino acid then another trna comes and copies the next segment on the mrna to makes a different amino acid this is done with the ribosomal rna at each segment being copied after doing this process for awhile it forms a polypeptide or protien
the trna then carries the aminos to the polypeptide chain after that the enzyme helps bond the chain together the dna is formed having the original strand that has the codes for the new strand to be formed each dna strand then has a new and original strand
the strand is translated into another language that the mrna understands the strand is then transcribed turned into an amino acid and then becomes part of a sequence of proteins
1 the mrna goes out of the nucleus and to the trna2 then the trna translates the rna and creates aminp acids to go along with the rna3 they attach together4 and they start making proteins
the four major steps  the first major step is prophase the second is changing into trna to deliver information the third is breaking down protein the fourth and final step is messenger it syntheises
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm2 mrna strands bind together in the cytoplasm3 the mrna binds with amino acids to for the ribosomes4 the new ribosome creates proteins as needed by the cell
first the mrna leaves the nucleus when it enters the cytoplasm the ribosomes meet up with it and it begins protein synthesis the trna matches up with it and the amino acids are formed after the opposite strand is made they break apart and you have a strand of amino acids
mrna tells ribosomes the amino acid sequence to make the proteinribosomes rrna assemble the proteintrna transfers the protein to the cellcell membrane allows protein in the cell
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna grabs onto a cell and goes throughout the body3 the mrna goes to the stomach4 the mrna starts the protein synthesis
ribosomes shape the mrna into a protein decoding what it says to know what the proteins job is vesicules transport the protein to where it needs to be membran protein sends the proteing out side of the cell if its needed
mrnatrnagrna
first the mrna leaves the nucleus then an enzyme unzipps the mrna the third step is an amino acids line up with the corresponding codons when it reaches the stop codon the amino acids break off together forming a protein
prophase anaphase metaphase telophase
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it leaves somthing behind causing the body to change and act differentalso when it leaves it can cause the body to catch a servere change and effect itit will cause the body to take more harm than it can handletoltal harm to the body and the body has no chance at fighting it off
dna to rna then coded for amino acids then make protein
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes and tells the cell what dna sequences to make then trna takes the message back to the nucleus at the nucleus the dna strand is pulled apart and the new dna sequences are paired up to their matches to make two new strands of dna
translation
mrna leave the nucleus going to trna once at trna the instructions brought from mrna are translated into a language that rrna can understand and then is taken to the rrna once at the rrna the instructions go through translation which result in a new protein
mrna dna rna prophase
transfers to trnamakes an amino acid sequencedecodes the amino acid sequencesends it to the
then it finds another single strand of mrna with matching codons after it finds the matching codons then the restrction enzyme cuts off the excess codons of the strands once that is done both ends of the mrna strands match each other
mrna goes out and finds trna and this information gets coded to that the trna grabs amino acids the amino acids tell wich enzymes the enzymes make the protein
cleans bacteria help cells and all dna and cleans
protien is created on the ribosome
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes out into the cell to find a ribosome once the ribosome receives information from the nucleus to make a new protein it beings to unzip floating nucleotides in the cytoplasm come in and connect with the rna that is being created
first mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it next trna comes along and attaches its anticodons to the mrnas codons then an amino acid is created and the trna strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons thus creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds the chain that is created is a protein
1 mrna leaves nucleus headed toward the ribosome2 it tranfers into trna3 that attaches to the ribosome4 there it is changed to rrna
anaphase metaphase prophase and telophase
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 mrna travels to the er3 trna gives mrna information 4 mrna replicates into an exact clone of the existing dna
mrna leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm when traveling the cytoplasm it connects to a ribosome the ribosomes reads off the mrna as a codonthree at a timeeach codon coding for a amino acid trna travels along the mrna and carries anticodons to connect with the codons the codons and anticodons are then connected making a strand of protein
step 1 the transcription of mrna from a dna genestep 2 translation occurs at the ribosomes in the cells cytoplasmstep 3 elongation of the peptide begins as various trnas reach the next codonstep 4 the protein is synthesised

the mrna splits in half then leaves the nucles and one half finds the correct thing then the other half one does too
protein synthesis starts with the mrna leaving the nucleus then trna transcribing the complimentry strand and finally rrna
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cytoplasm then it travels to the mitochondria where it goes through transcription then it detatches from the mitochondria and goes through translation
it brengs the prton to the dna
mrna attaches to a dna strand then the dna strand unzipsthen it attaches to some proteinsand then creates amino acids
the protein combines with studd the protein could die the protein could reproduce and the protein could mutate
mrna leaves the nucleus than rna gets sent to the mitochandria than protein is sent throughout the body

gain necessary cell s for the process spread out and collect the cells go through the cell cycle  continue through the cycle til process is completed
1 mrna leaves 2 tna
after mrna leaves the nucleus transcription occurs  mrna is messenger rna and carries the message to chromosomes  when it arrives at the chromosomes the mrna enters and gives all its information to the chromosomes about how the proteins should be arranged  the chromosomes then take that information and arrange the proteins accordingly
mrna leave the nucleus brings information to the amino acid amino acid produces protein
first translation starts then the codons are made codons are matched up finaly rna starts again
once the mrna leaves the nucleus is goes through the blood stream while in the blood stream once it gets to the other nucleus it drops off the information from the nucleus it just came from after all that the mrna is needed no longer then comes the trna that will help the other nucleus figure out the message then it helps the nucleus decode the new message to where it will make sense to the nucleus then the rrna comes along the rrna picks up on the new decoded message once the rrna is done getting the message it takes it the last step would be to take the code and make another rna sequence
first the mrna leaves the nucleoussecond the mrna travels trough the cytoplasmthird it arrives at the amino acid sequence of a proteinfinally it duplicates

1the mrna attaches onto a ribosome2 the ribosome reads the mrnas code by three letters at a time three letters strung together are called a codon3each trna molecule has one of the many anticodons the complementary code of a codon attached to them once the rrna reads a codon the trna with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome4 the anticodon is put on a string attached to the ribosome that when put together with the other anticodons later to come make a certain protein the trna is released from the ribosome

the mrna leaves the nucleus and then becomes a trna from there its becomes into grna the last part is where it becomes rrna and helps the ribosomes enzymes and protein
trna
the mrna leaves the nucleus and to the ribosome  there it gives the message to start protein synthesis  the protein recieves the messages and the ribosome begins to synthesis it
the mrna then is copied except for the thymine that is changed to uracil and it moves to the ribosomes and is helped made into a protein then the trna goes to the cell
nucleotides ribonucleic nuclear membrane and nucleoplasm are four major steps involved in the protein synthesis
1the cell opens2 rna comes out3then the cell releases the glucose4then the glucose goes back into a different cellthe cell opens and the rna comes out and then the cell releases the glucose out into the cytoplasm and then the glucose goes into a different cell
first it travels in a long line to ribosomessecond the mrna is ripped in halfthird a new strand is made to connect to the mrnalast it lives happily ever after
it gose to a ribosome and a trna links up with the ribosommrna to make a specific protien the protien gets attached to another over and over again to from a protien chain
mrna trna grna rrna
the mrna first goes to the erthen the er makes the proteinnext the trna begins to carry the proteinsfinally the trna comes back to the cell
the mrna copies the anti codons from the dna and transports it through the cytoplasm then it meets up with the trna and makes an amino acid
first the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm with the amino aid sequence of a protein which was translated from the dna then the trna attatches to the mrna and takes the amino acid sequence and copies it the trna then goes to the ribosome the organelle where protein synthesis takes place the trna which contains the amino acid sequence for assembling the proteins gives its information for protein synthesis to the ribosome the ribosome then assembles the proteins with the sequence given to it by trna
trnamrna grnarrna
the process of protien synthesis invovles four steps including phase 1meiosis phase 2 and mitosis  this causes many changes within the cell
the mrna is taken to the cytoplasmthe trna helps to create the new protien
lightindependent ractions lightdependent reactions
trna
it stays in the mitochondrion to produce more protein
after mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mrna codes for  in the ribosome the mrna is read in the sequence of codons and calls the trna to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon  the trna keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain  when the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell
the virus because it will kill you really bad
mrna leaves the nucleus to go and be checked for errors once the mrna is in the cytoplasm protein syntheis follows along the line of nitrogen bases to check for mutation or mistakes the mistakes are found and labeled to be change then an enzyme comes to redo the mistaken nitrogen bases
it will travel down it carries the insturction on what to do and how to react
trnarrnamrna
the mrna leaves the nucleus and matches up with trna then it splits and creates a new complimentary strand of rna
mrna leaves the nucleus then it sends messages to the nucleus telling the organenelles what to do and what to fight off
the four main steps involed in protein synthesis are transcription translation sequencing and separating transcription is when the rna is read and translation is when the new rna strans are made
the relay messages
after the mrna leaves the nucles it sets out to find the ribosome to make rrna and give the needed amino acid code that is needed to make proteins after completing this it transforms into trna to transfer the code after getting the needed amino acids it then transforms back into mrna and heads back to the nucleus
1     mrna transcripts trna2     trna goes to the ribosome3     trna transcripts and the amino acids are made when the             base pairs join4     the left over bases are removed from the cell by the                    lysosome
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to rrna and then it changes to trna which carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acids
mrna directs the rna to make the protiens then a signal from the nucleus tells it to stop
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it divides the new dna into all of the different cells
after it leaves the nucleus it then goes to the trna to give it some memory then after that it goes to the rrna to make more ribosomes
the messenger rna conects to amino acids to givedirections to them protiens are then conected to the mrna an connected to the amino acids creating more rna
mrna leaving the nucleus
1 the mrna is split in half2 one half of the mrna runs through a ribosome3 while the half of the mrna is being ran through the ribosome a protien is being made according to the instructions 4 the protien travels to wherever it is programmed to go and to do whatever it is programmed to do
wellll i think the first one might be meiosis or mitosisbut i really dont have any idea so im just taking a wild guess so i dont get this question wrongkthanks for the poinnts
1 rna arrives from other cell2rna copied translation  3rna tranported through mrna4 rna leaves to go to other cell
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it binds with the rrna after they bind together they begin transciption to make more copies for more protiens after transcription occurs translation begins to decode the rna that has been made  after this has been done the rna then begins to made amino acid that will form protiens
in protein synthesis the mrna must first leave the nucleus it then goes to the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome from there it attaches to its complimentary codon and finally becomes a protein strand
the mrna leaves then nucleus it goes and copies a protien for the sequence it returns to the nucleus it transfers the protein
it goes to the to the nuclues then gets coded on the dna and then turns into waste

the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
one how they got the mrnatwo what they are going to do with the nucleusthree how they are planning on doing itfour why they are going to change
they all do there job
1 proteins leaves the nuclei2 proteins become stable3orgenelles become numerous4the reproduction rate becomes high
1 first mrna sends a message to the protein strand and tells it what amino acids it needs to build the strand2 then the trna goes and gets the codons from the amino acids so they can build their protein3 next they group the codons in three so they can be read so they know what amino acids to get4 last they put the amino acids in order and then you get a protein strand
its good for youmakes you stronggood for health
mrna then codes for pretiens that bind with rrna
protein is distributed through the ribosomes and stored through out the cell after the mrna tells it what to do
1 mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
anaphasemetaphaseprophaseinterphase
protein gos into the blood and around the body it helps to keep muscles storng
prophase anaphase interphase metaphase protein synthesis is carried out through a long process
duplication translocation  replication mitosis
in protein sythesis the mrna travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm there a ribosome reads the code on the mrna as the ribosome reads the code trna find free amino acids and bring them to the mrna to be arranged when they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein
after mrna leaves the nucleus it enters into the cytoplasm where it docks at a ribosome made of rrna next trna reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds it then travels back to the mrna and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it once the trna reaches the stop codon the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed
the mrna leaves the nucleas and goes to trna which transfers the codons and anticodons then which gets translated into a sequence which produces amino acids and then in the sequence makes proteins
the mrna finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on  once the mrna finds the ribosome the aug codon starts the protein synthesis  next trna bring the correct anticodons to the mrna for the construction of the protein  once the trna have delivered the correct anticodons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anticodons  the anticodons are then paired up the the codons on the mrna strand and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons  when the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made
1the rna goes into a ribosome2 transfer rna brings amino acids to mach the sequence of the mrna3 as more trna comes  with more amino acids the amino acids start to stack up4the compleated protins breaks away
mrna then sends its message to the nuclear membrane to creat certain dna codes for it  then the sequence of creating dna begins
anaphase prophasemetephase and telephase
the trna will deliver instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence to produce proteins
rna it happensdna it really happensrrna this doesnt happenmrna i really hope that this happens
trna rrna transcription translocation transference
the four strands the production of protein helping the mrna in able for it to complete the synthesis the proteins are assembled
next trna change the rna strands from asts cs and gs to as us cs and gs so that it can be read by something that i cant remember but then its changed back to its original state and paired with anticodons that are attached to amino acids the anticodons break off so that only the amino acid remains once the anticodons reach the stop codon the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein
one step involves the golgi apparatus in which it helps carry proteinsanother step uses the er which helps get rid of unwanted or wasted material involving the proteinslysosomes also help break down things that can help with protein synthesis
first the mrna leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it second the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence or codon and calls for a trna molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon third after this process is repeated the amino acids on the trna molecules form peptide bonds with each other forming a protein finally after the mrna is translated until a stop codon the protein is released and used in the cell as needed
1 first the nucleus would go through metaphase     2 second the nucleus would go through anaphase3 third the nucleus would go through telophase4 last the nucleus would go through cytokenisis
after leaving the nucleus mrna goes to the ribosomes and turns into trna once it becomes trna it makes codons or becomes anticodons once it becomes codons it makes amino acids
1 it turms into trna and travels to the ribosome2 it picks up surrounding amino acids and takes them to the ribosome3 it forms rrna and begins binding the amino acids in the ribosome4  it then forms a new strand of rna
collecting nutriants storing them anaphase  and then there is prophase
1 they have proteins2 they help wit mrna3 4
first mrna leaves the nucleus with a strand of dna which contains the instructions to making an amino acid it takes the dna strand to the trna in the ribosomes there the trna uses the codons to make the sequence of amino acids the amino acids are then transferred by the trna to the rrna where they become a protein
mrna leaves the nucleus carrying instructions for the amino acid sequence to create proteins first the mrna will send the instructions to the needed part of the cell then this will turn into dna thirdly proteins would begin to be ensembled in the correct part of the cell and lastly they would be released into the body where they are needed
next mrna attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein  rrna combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain  trna finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mrna  all of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein
1 the mrna takes the coded dna to trna2 the trna takes the coded dna and translates it to amino acids3 the rrna copies the amino acids4 they are placed as traits
the first step is where the mrna goes to the ribosones  soo they dna can be replicated the second step is wjere the trna gets added with the dna the third step is  when the trna foes back to the nucleus to get added to the dna i cant remember the last
the mrna must copy its self
mrna is when it carries information to trna which then carries instructions from the nuclues to the amino acid sequence for the protein rrna then takes the information to the center of all the protein synthesis
the mrna moves to the outside of the nucleusthe mrna then moves to the outside of the cellthe mrna then delivers the dna to another nucleusthe dna is made into another cell
first the mrna leaves the nucleus than the mrna goes to the cell membrane next the mrna will multiply in the cell membrane than the mrna will start to go to the nucleus and start all over again
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are mrna leaving the nucleus
rnarrnatrnagrna
it enters it grows it breaks down it leaves
trna carries instruction from nucleus for amino acid sequence of a protein
the four major steps involved in protien synthesis are rrna trna grna the process ends
1 gets dna messages spreading through the cell2 delivers dna codes3 helps break down dna codes needed for cell cycle4 releases protein into the cell
start codon code for rna protein is made stop codon
the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome where trna then translates the mrna into proteins
mrna leaving the nucleustrnarrna
the mrna comes to the ribosme where then the dna is decoded by trna the trna then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the trna each of the segments have their own amino acid which they then all are bonded by peptide bonds to create a protein
after mrna it will go to trna and then i will coil so much to where it becomes dna
it slowly leaves it
it just puts protein out through the body to keep it healthy and gives you energy to do things
the trna comes in and copies itselfthen the mrna sends protiens to all the trnathen the mrna comes back then it adds another mrna
the first stepis mrna connects to the ribosome to keep it in place  secondly trna brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair  on the third step another trna brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather and the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon
the prophase lets the rna form the chromosomes metaphase lines them in the middle anaphase seperates them on opposite ends of the cell then telophase seperates them into new cells
mrna gives the message to trna wich transfers the message to the grna wich sends it to th rrna wich then makes it into protiens
mrna leaves the nucleus then passes on the information needed to make proteins the cells gather and conect the parts needed to make the protein the last step is finished to form and pass on the protein
step 1 the mrna goes out and grabs the sequence that is needed step2 the mrna sequnce choosen then codes for tranlation the trna then takes the base pair codes and goes out and grabs the aminoacidsstep3 the amino acid sequence would then be added to the original step4 a new strand with a new sequence would be formed
after mrna leaves the nucleus production of information must be recived and retained by rrna  after that it processes the information and moves it with trna  then mrna recives it again and makes more  it all happens again after that and the making of proteins occur over and over again
the mrna goes to a ribosmethen it gets fitted with an amino acid then it becomes trna then it can be used as a protien
1 mrna leaves the nucleus and sends amino acid sequence to the rrna2 rrna goes to the mitochondria and gives it instruction to build the protein3 once protein is  created trna attaches to a hydrogen atom4 trna carries the hydrogen to the protein and forms a covalent bond with the protein
attaching to a strand of dna
mrna carries the protein from on part of the cell to another the mrna get the orders to go to the ribosomes and get the proteins to take it where it needs to go
trna transfers the data to the cytoplasmrrnamakes the proteins
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus to take the information of the amino acid to the protein2 the trna go out to get amino acids 3 the trna bring the amino acids back to the nucleus4 they attach them to the strand of dna
the steps following are transcription initiation elongation termination
trnadnarnamrna
all ts are tuned int us the mrna is translated into codons codons ar turned into ameno acids ameno acids are turned into a proteins
1 mrna starts to decode the dna2 34 protein and rna structures are finished
mrna must first translate the amino acid into a language that can be read then the mrna has to transcribe the amino acid so that it can be used
1 the ribosones collect the mrna2 the ribosomes biuld the mrna into the correct sequence3 transcription happens4 the mrna is pair and attached to the dna creating a protein
after mrna leaves the nucleus it meets up with a rna polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon as it reads the mrna codons and trna begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mrna these amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mrna once it reaches the stop codon it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away
they make a copy of the dna and then they replicate it and then translate it
goes through the golgi then through the blood stream to the endoplasmic reticulum then passes the mitchocondria the mitosis occurs
protein synthesis occurs by mrna transporting it to the endoplasmic reticulum then the protein is copied and then split several times again then the proteins copies are later returned to the nucleus and used from then on out
mrna then goes to the trna where  the trna  makes an exact copy of the template the trna  then matches  up with the correct spot on the organelle then the organelle makes a protein that the  body needs and sends it to  were  it is needed
dna is copied into a smaller form called messanger rna or mrna and then that is copied into tranfer rna or trna to be transfered and replectated once the nucleotide sequences are copied back into mrna then a new cell has a new set of complete dna
first the mrna leaves the nucleus the next step is to divided the atps after that one energy leaves the atp then it is given a new name
transcription translation
1 the mrna changes into trna2 the trna caries proteins to where theyre supposed to go3 the trna changes into proteins and goes where the other proteins went4 the body uses those protiens for a variety of things such as making new muscle or healing a cut or exercise
transcription the process of copying the dna and making the mrnathe mrna is then delivered to the ribosometranslation the mrna is read by trnathen the cell produces protien by building it
anaphase metaphase telaphase and prophase
translation is when dna is copied into rna then the rna is copied into mrna in transcription
1mrna will pass trna a message2trna will pass the message to the mitochondria3the mitochodria gets the message and produce proteins4the proteins are produced
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
the first thing it does is that is travels throught the cells cytoplasm to to ribosomes then the ribosomes help turn it into protein the protein is taken my trna back to the nucleus and then the prosess starts all over again
transactiontranslationtranscription
after mrna leaves the nucleus transcription and translation occur transcription is the copying of the strand and translation is moving the sequences for the strand there is also replication which makes an exact replicate of the dna strand
protein sythis builds up over time wich makes it easer for animal and many other things to get stronger and stronger through out time this cause some problemsfor many weak animals that are not as strong out there to just get eaten and killed by many stronger predators
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it then will take the information to trna so trna can then transfor the information
after the mrna leave the nucleus trna come in and gets a gentic copy of the mrna the trna detaches from the mrna then takes the information to make a amino acid sequence
it has the protiens which are being transfered to the dna stran so it can join togethr then break off to make an entirely new dna strand
the mrna is decoded and ine infermation is copied and used to creat the protiens
it goes to the nucleus then from there it goes to the cell membrane after that it travels to the golgi apperatous finally it goes to the cytoplasm
mrna leaves the nucleus transcription happens where the message is transcribed then it gets translated then it goes to the ribosome where a new when gets made
mrna leaves th nucleus to send a meesage to trnamrna tells trna to go get more genetic codestrna carries instructions from the nucleas for the amino acid sequence of a proteinand complets the strand of dna in the ribosome
when mrna leaves the nucleus there are four major steps involved for protein synthesis they are prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase they help with meiosis prophase is where the nuclear membrane dissapear and the chromosomes split metaphase is where the chromosomes line up anaphase is where the chromosomes go off into groups and telophase is when they gain the nuclear membrane back
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cell  it moves to a ribosome  the ribosome makes trna  then protien is synthesized
transcriptionreplicationtranslation
the mrna leaves the nucleus and is then synthesized into trna which carries the code for making proteins the trna is transcribed into rrna which can then be used by the body to synthesize proteins
making the protein getting things to assemble the protein getting information on how to make protein synthesizing protein
after mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum which filters the bad protiens out then it is released into the cytoplasma of the cell then it leaves the cell and transports diferent material to a different cell
trnagrnamrnarrna
first it goes to the cells and then the cells take it and follow the directions then they copy it and make more dna
1 mitocandiria
mrna leaves     gives the code to trna     trna gives the amino acid to the protien     they mix
translation
mrnatrnaand rrnamrna sends messages to the nuclues trna transports proteins through the cell and rrna makes ribosomes for the cell
the trna transfers data
1 mrna copies into trna2 trna transfers to a double helix3 the trna copies to another dna4 there are two copies of dna
when the mrna leaves the nucleus 1 it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins  2 ribosomes then move in to begin the process of synthesis where anticodons are moved on to the correct codons transferring the correct amino acid code that is to be made 3 the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with peptide bonds 4 a stop codon tells the amino acids to stop and the previous amino acid becomes the last in the chain making a complete protein
it copies itself then it translates then it transcripts
prtein synthesis takes place after leaving the nucleus the four major steps are movement reproduction growth and  new rna
mrna as a polymer is involved in protein synthesis they are making the proteins snythesis with each otherstep 1 to arrive where the proteins are2 brake the proteins up3 conncet proteins again with rna 4 the process is complete
transcription ribosome calls for amino acids translation proteins are made by the amino acids binding together
transportation dna becoming mrnatranscription mrna becoming protienspeptide bonds holding the protiens togetherdeoxirybose the sugar in the protiens it helps make the protiens
the first step in protein synthesis is after leaving the nucleus the mrna will look for the protein the second step is the mrna will copy the protein  the therd step is that the mrna will make new protein and the final step is the mrna will head back to the nucleus
first the dna turns into mrna then the mrna is turned into rna through the process of transcriptionthen the rna leaves the nucleus and goes through a process of translationthen signals for the trnathen the trna makes the proteins
during protein synthesis mrna leaves the nucleus  the trna takes the anticodon and matches it with the corresponding codon on the mrna molecule  it attaches on the ribosome    this then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain  once those steps are complete you have the protein that the mrna was coded for
the mrna goes to out of the cell and travels to the others cells and then comes back into the cell to repeat the process
the dna is copied by the mrna then is translated by the trna then for every 3 strands of codons are translated an amino acid chain is formed then when the code for stop happens a protein is formed
after the the mrna leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m rna seeks out a ribosome  an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge rna  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for after the mrna finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians a codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid  amino acid the building blocks for proteins as the ribosomes read the codon sequence the ribosome calls trna to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain after a protein chain has been made the mrna has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm after the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it after all the final touches are added to the protein chain it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body after the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal after the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
the mrna leaves the nucleus through a process called prophase then the cell gets ready to dived with interphase ten the cell starts to seperate with interphase then the cell is finished seperating with metaphase
mrna reads the message to the other parts of the celltrna transfers carries the message to the other parts of the cell
mrna sends the message to the ribosome so the ribosome knows what codons to make for the proteins so the right proteins are made  the proteins are then sent to the areas of the body that they are needed in
the mrna brings the information to the trna the trna transports the codons to the mitochondrion the mitochondrion synthesizes the proteins and the trna transports the proteins to where they need to go
the first step is anaphase which that is still in its nucleus the second step is prophase which that is starting to split into two different cells the third step is telephase which is were they split apart the fourth step is metaphase which is were the cells are apart and at on there own
first they leave the body then copy themselves then transfer last they make a new strand
after leaving the nucleus there are a few steps in protein synthesis  mrna enters the ribosome and prepares for transcription  in transcription the enzyme rna polymerase binds to dna and splits the two strands apart  it then uses one strand as a template for nucleotides to form a strand of rna  then it has to go into translation  mrna is used as instructions for decoding  the ribosome is what makes the protein
1 transcription where trna codes for a certain amino acid 2 the amino acid is created according to what the trna coded for3 the sequence is held together by peptide bonds4 the amino acid sequence is taken back by the mrna
first the mrna leaves the nucleus after it got transcribed from half of a strand of dna the small and large ribosomes then attach to the rna to translate it the codons get translated to an amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and go to the next codon they do this until they have a long strand of amino acids to make a protein
mrna goes into translation were the protiens move then trna were it unzips then were it is moved again and then it zips up again
the mrna makes a  copy of the dna strand the mrna gives it the trna that sends then the rrnamakes a protien chain the protien chain then moves and makes a new cell
one step is microevolution
trna is the transporterrnadna the structure of an organismmrna
the four major steps are transcription transportation conversion and rrna
mrna leaves the nucleusmrna turns to trnatrna then transfers the info to another part of the cellthe info is then read and the protein is created
first the mrna attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mrna in segments of three called codons for each codon there is a complementary amino acid secondly trna picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome thirdy the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mrna strand by the ribosome the chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mrna strand lastly the ribosome disconnects from the mrna strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell
mrna grna rrna trna
mrna attaches to proteinprotein reaches the start codonprotein reaches the stop codonsequence ends
it has to go through all the rna first then it goes to the protein synthesis then it leaves the nucleus
mrna rna dna
1 leave the nucleus2 run through the system3 get towards the end4 leave the system5 live happily ever after 
1 the dna turns into mrna2then the mrna turns into trna3the cycle happens over again
the mrna leaves the nucleus and transcribes the dna codes to the trna then the trna turns these codes into rna codes from there the rrna makes doubles of all of the new information
they carry all the information from the nucleus for the amino acid of the protein they have to make new copies of the information to put for trna then they leave the nucleus and the trna travels in
1the mrna gets packaged up by the golgi apparatus2the proteins travel through the endoplasmic reticulum3the nucleus sends information to tell the ribosomes how to make the protein and for what functions4ribosomes make the protein and is put into use
trna breaks loose and grabs onto amino acids mrna leaves the nucleus and goes over to the ribosome trna goes to the ribosome with the amino acids mrna bonds everything together
sending ribosomal messages
trnamdna
the first step is that mrna leaves the nucleas the mrna then gets the trna to make a covalent bond
metephasewhere the cell still has its nucluesprophase the step where the nucleus dissapears and the organisms start to form a line for seperationtelephase the last step before the cell divides the organisms inside the cell seperate to different ends of the cell to get ready for anaphase the line is fromed in the middle of the cellanaphase where the cell divides into two cells
the mrna goes to the ribosomes for the instructions on making protein  it then goes to the mitochondria to get energy they it goes back to the nucleus to produce the protein
it brakes down into smaller parts and then is shipped  to different parts of the body so it can be used as energy
when the mrna leaves the nucleous the protiens go with it
the trna coming and bringing the amino acidsmrna taking the amino acids to the ribosomes where they are made
they match up with the dna sequence put into bonds that were copied and then changed
mrna leaves light goes in
it leaves the nucleus and helps the cell find protiens for the cell and help it survive and make it healthy
after mrna leaves the nuclues it goes to ribosomal rna each trna anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rrna the trna forms the complement of the mrna strand and the attached amino acids connect to one another until a stop codon is reached
1 mrna leaves the nucleus carry the message from the cell membrane2 rrnacarries the ribosome to the codon3 trna transfers the segment needed to be traslated4 the condon strand is translated
mrna sends messages on what to transcript
prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
1 after mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rrna recognizes the mrna strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mrna2 once the mrna is within the ribosome sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mrna strand otherwise known as a codon and a corresponding anticodon attached to trna and an amino acid are signalled to attach3trna continues to attach itself to the mrna strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons in doing so the trna which have attached amino acids begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein4 once the the protein has been formed which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome from there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly
amino acid makes the protienthe protien does stuff with the ribosome
it goes to the michochindria and starts attaching codons to make aprotein
mrna leaves the nucleus then it arrives a a ribosome where it is turned in to trna then ammino acid prduction begins and segments of the trna are copied to produce them
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
you have the mrna that takes to the original rna and makes everything right agian
the mrna leaves the nucleusthe mrna goes to the trna and transcribes its informationthe trna goes to a ribosomethe trna translates onto the rrna and begins making proteins
the mrna leaves the nucleus with the information to build the protein the mrna takes the information to the ribosome which then reads the information in sequences of three called codons  then the ribosome will search for the correct codon which is carried by the trna this creates a sequence of amino acids and when there are the correct amount of amino acids it is created into a protein
the trna leave the cellrealesespeptic bonds it eneter the nuclus and the mrna
it goes through to the passive transport and then the selectrive membrane chooses what is good and what is bad the bad stuff then goes out of the cell and the good is then taken to the mitochondria to be put to proper use
1it leaves the nucleus2it roams around3it looks for a way back4it returns
dna rna mrna mdna
after it leaves the nucleus it then goes to the
anaphaseinterphasemetaphasetelephase
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are anaphaseprofacemetaphaseinterphase
1 the protiens move move2 it starts going throught many different sages3 it prepares for itself to double  4 the protien is doubled
prophasemetaphaseanaphase and interphase
phospate moves around cell active transport lets proteins pass through process begins over again
mrna leaves the nucleus
step 1 mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasmstep 2 rrna copies the strand of mrnastep 3 trna takes the copies to get a new strand of nucleotidesstep 4 the mrna matches up with its trna and the nucleotides make a protein
the first amnio acid comes and attaches to the mrna then dehydration synthesis occurs after that the hydrogen bond brakes and that amnio acid goes to find more protien then that procees continues
well you might have to go through the cleanins and purifing stage
1 the mrna goes with the protien sythesis to the rough er2 the trna then proceeds with the information for protein production3
the mrna delivers the message so its like the messenager
the mrna leaves the nucles and is then coped by ribosomes and is turned into the protein
the mrrna then moves to the mitochondria from there the mitochondria reads the sequence of mrna once the sequence is read a supplementary copy is made the supplementary copy is then synthesized by the mitochondria
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it gets strands then it creates sequences and they turn into amino acids after turning into amino acids they become energy
leaves nucleus enters body delivers messages about amino acid sequence heads back to nucleus
it would go through the nucleus and it would send the mrna to trna and the trna would transfer it to rrna
first the newly formed mrna branches away from the stand of dna second the information carried by the mrna is transported to a new cell third the information carried by the mrna is copied into the new cell lastly the cell then creates the dna structures that were copied
dna trna rrna  amino acids
when mrna also known as the messanger rna leaves the nucleous and attaches onto an rrna ribosome the rrna matches the mrna to a trna  the ribosome takes three mrna at a time and docks them untill the trna comes with the match and each match has a code  the code aug means to start that way the body knows when to start protein synthesis
mrnatrnarrna
mrna there is the protein synthesis that gos throw the mrna and you got your nuclis and your cells and the moliculs
rna leaves the nucleus then it brings back protien
tranlsation transcription transformation
the ribosome uses protien synthesis to make protiens
mrna leaves the nucleus the nucleus disappearsmrna reaches its destination
go to the goli apparatus then it takes the messages to the ribosomes to be taken where the information needs to be place and the part where it is placed will know what to do next
trnamrnarrna
they all have a important part
osmosis
mrna leaves the nucleus trna transports information from the nucleus the amino acids go to the cell rrna packages and distributes the proteins
translation deletion transformation and transcription
that that is a bacteria that cant cause cancer on your system
rrna trna grna  trna
meiosis seperating of the cellmetaphase the cell combinesprophase the brakes and develops into twointerphase the cell gets back in two and starts the process over again
prophase metaphase anaphase telaphase
it carrries it to where its going then it breaks the materiall down it then protects the material then it makes sure its sacure
membrane dissapearing
the mrna leaves the nucleus then goes to the cytoplasm where the protein is made is met by a trna which takes the protein and moves it away then the protein is released
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 two nuclei come together3 then they go apart4 finally they become more powerful
first the proteins go through a check process then the cell membrane fixes anything that is wrong then the nucleotides make bind to the mrna and finally the mrna and the protein bind together
the first step as already stated is the mrna leaving the nucleus to be formed into a protein  the mrna then encounters rrna the ribosome which begins reading off the codons on the mrna to begin forming a protein  transfer rna then comes with anticodons to form amino acids that form together to create the protein
it travels throught the er then the golgi apperatus
after mrna has left the nucleus it floats around until it finds a matching strand  after it has found its matching strand the two strands line up and then connect to each other creating a protein
resperation absorbtion intakeexpulsion
it attatches to the endoplasmic reticulumthen what is not needed gets sent to the lysosomes
well the rna does not want to be there any more
protein goes to ur mucles
amino acids help build protein and sugars for atp
anaphase telephase prophase and interphase
it goes to trna then to rna itself
rna is crossed over the dna is synthesised with the mrna and the leftover strands are leftover and sythisised with other dna now
mrna leaves the nucleus then the chromosomes split move to different sides and create two new cells
mrna leaves the nucles the rna carries instructions from the nucleus the ribosomes use the instructions the ribosomes make proteins
starting with mrna it leaves the nucleus then it sends its instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein it returns back as trna it transfers the protein to the nucleus
the mrna goes to the ribosome were the p site and a site attach the trna brings the anticodon and the amino acid the anticodon matches with the correct codon the amino acids that the trnas have brought over all connect in the correct formation
the mrna leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome then trna that fits comes and attaches to the mrna the trna then builds up into amino acids that link together to become a protein
first mrna leaves the nucleus then the mrna enters a ribosome the ribosome then reads the mrna sequence and sends for trna which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mrna as well as an amino acid this repeats with the amino acids joining together eventually making a protein
dna is unzipped copied and zipped back up the copied strand is the mrna wich is then copied also
major steps in protien synthesis is the mrna leaves the nucleus it separates strands and divides out of the nuleuss walls then the new copy is sent inside the nucleus i new protien is made there are many parts to this process but these are the main ones
mrna leavesorganelles appearmutation startsthe mitochondrian is working harder
in protein synthesis after the mrna leaves the nucleus it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm  it then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied  transfer rna brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome it attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons the trna the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the trna behind it  once the mrna reaches a stop codon the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond
transcription translation
mrna then it a messanger to the dna then to defusion
interphasemetaphaseanaphase and telophase
well the first step is basically just the mrna leaving the nucleus and then moving on up in the world because you know what the nucleus wasnt a very happy being ultimately ending with the mrna not liking the treatment he was recieving so he left the second stage is the mrna getting his own place so he can start out fresh and brand new he settles down and finds himself a nice woman mrna strand and they eventually have some children and live the good lifestage three consists of the everyday life of mrna at his work place basically its just his day as he works and manages his life whether it be personal or businessthe fourth and final stage is the overall story summed up and then it shows the family live happily ever after and even has mr mrna thanking the nucleus for not liking him and forcing him to leave and roam the free world to find a better life a more prosperous and fulfilling one
1 mrna messenger rna leaves the nucleus with instructions from the nucleus to amino acids for a sequence of a protein2 trna transfer rna transfers the dna sequence by codons and figures out the genetic code 3 rrna ribosomial rna gives the information to a ribosome organelle which now holds all the information4 the rrna carries the information back to the nucleus so it can carry out the process and retain the genetic information that it recieved
prophasemetaphaseanaphasetelophasehaha i dont know 
translation transcription transport and trna are the steps for protein synthesis
the mrna goes to the ribosome where the trna translates the mrnas codons into peptide chains that then make a polypeptide chain that goes with others to make a protien
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protien
one major step is having an enough rnastep two is having an enough dnastep three is to proctect the nuleusstep four is to get of any virus
prophase anapahase metaphase telophase
protects the cell
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis is  1 interphase are starting to make own chromosomes 2 prophase  3 metaphase getting itself ready to split into two different parts 4 cytokensis were the two seperate
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes into the cytoplasm and delivers the message to all ribosomes telling them to make this certain type of protein the ribosomes then start producing this protein from there the proteins enters the endoplasmic reticulum to be connected and checked for defects after that it goes into the golgi apparatus to be synthesised and packaged to go out into the rest of the cell
4 major steps involved in protein synthesis is number 1 the proteins level on top of each other 2 the strands have to open up 3 the ball of protein is able to slide through 4 its on the other side
starting with mrna it goes through trna rrna
mrnatrnammrna
copyingmutating crossing overreading the cell
breaking down other protein  making new protein and using the new protein
once the mrna leaves the nucleus it makes its way through the cell and to the mitocondriton from there it goes through a cycle and
1 the mrna takes the energy to the ribosomes2 it then gives the energy to the trna3 the trna transfers this energy into the ribosomes4 the ribosomes turn the energy into protein
first the mrna leaves the nucleus and locates in the cytoplasm at the ribosomes once it was relocated to the ribosomes it is transfered into rrna and then read by the trna once the trna reads the information amino acids are produced and they are the building blocks of proteins
1 replication produces exact cell2 translation creates mrna3 transversal created trna
mrna carries the protein then carries it to trna trna moves binds it
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 then the mrna travels to the er and rough er3 both of the ers then make the proteins4 finally the proteins are transported to the ribosomes where they are held until needed
four major step are involved whenever the mrna leaves the nucleus the first major step is that the mrna becomes attached to a ribosome the next step is that the mrna joins with the trna the third step is that for every three codons the trna creat anitcodons the last step is the making of the amino acids by the trna transfering the anticodons into amino acids which is needed fpr tje reproduction of dna
1 mrna reaches the ribosome2 the mrna is read and is copied3 the mrna sequence is copied to trna4 the trna is then copied and the copies are used to make more proteins
step 1they collect the dna and leave the nucleusstep 2it gets transferred to the ribosomesstep 3amino acids are formedstep 4proteins are built by the amino acids
the mrna moves from the nucleus to the rna then the rrna begins to read the mrna the trna goes to get an amino acid and brings it back to the rrna once it has the amino acid the protein begins to be replicated
a protien attatches to the mrna and makes a copy of it the copy is the same sequence but it is the opposite sequence the sequences then matches up with the amino acids that pair up with each amino acid the mrna is now a different form of rna
the mrna will reach a ribosome the trna will find the amino acid that the mrna needs the amino acids will stick together a protein will be made out of the amino acid strand
prophaseanaphasemetaphasewhere the cells begins to splitinterphase
1 the mrna arives at the ribazones2 the ribazones decode the mrna3 the ribazones use the decoded mrna to mek proteins4 the proteins are used for energy in the cell
once mrna has left the nucleus it is transferd to trna in the cytoplasm and then the trna takes the information to the amino acid this information tells the amino acids what to produce and then the proteins are produced from the information sent by mrna
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through a process called transcription the mrna travels to a ribosome and more proteins are made as this is happening the mrna also continues to make more polypeptides on the strand after this a complementary strand is formed and another strand of dna is made
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 dna begin stacking up3
the four major steps are interphase prophase anaphase metaphase
prophase is where the parts of the cell move anaphase is where they break out of the nucleus metaphase is where the parts of the cell line up in the middle telaphase is where the cell divides
4 steps involved in protein synthesis is mrna is moving into the cytoplams then it binds with the rrna in ribosome then trna binds its anticodon to the codon of the mrna then translation occurs and polypeptide chains of amino acids are formed
the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes and gets an amino acid that matches up on the trna strand then it goes back and gets more and more until the whole protein chain has been completed
after mrna leaves the nucleus the next step would be for it to deliver the information it is carrying then trna tranfers the information the step would be for transcription translation and transcibing
carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
mrna gives a message to trna that has what amino acids the dna strand has the trna brings the rna to the dna sequence and the rna lines up with the amino acids these make up proteins
translation mrna is translated into codonstranscription codons code for amino acidsamino acids are hooked together to create a chainthe chain creates a protein
prophase anaphase telophase meiosis
the four major steps involved in protein sylnthesis is the mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes and gets the message decoded after that then the body sends out the proper proteins lastly the proper proteins are sent and the process is started all over again
the mrna enters the ribosome it then begins translation when the anticodons from the trna match up with the codons on the mrna the starting codon is always met as the trna attaches to the mrna the amino acids above them form peptide bonds finally the last step is the stop codon on the mrna this signals the end of protein synthesis
proteins have to move through out the organism for cells and functions to work right

the mrna takes the code to the trna  the trna transfers the code to the rrna on the ribosomes  then it builds a second strand to make the proteins

mrna leaves the nucleus
trna which transfers protein from point a to point b
the four major steps in making protien synthesis include mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna makes prtiens with enzymes and the protiens are made and used
the major part is amino acids being apart of it and helping us have what we need to survive
anaphaseinterphasemetaphaseprophase
mrna exits the nucleus then it sends message to the ribosome it does this by entering the ribosome once here a amino acid is assembled the acid is attached by a codon that was put forth due to the mrnas message after this the new amino acids is put forth and joined with others this forms the protein
mrna leaves the nucleasmrna codes for trnaamino acids on trna bond to form a chain of amino acidsthe chain of amino acids folds into a proteinmrna leaves the nucleas after being copied from dna  this mrna is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteinsmrna then travels to a ribosome  at the ribosome the mrna is run through and trna with anticodons on one end attach to the mrnaeach trna particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon  when two trna particles connect to the mrna at the same time a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of trna can disconnect  as this process continues the amino acids begin to form a chainonce the strand of mrna contains a stop codon and trna reaches it the final amino acid will bond to the chain  once this animo acid disconnects with the trna the strand folds up into a specific protein
mrna leaves the nucleustrna transfers informationsrrna has ribosomes that help rnathen rna is made

the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are mrna leaving the nucleus proteins being copied more proteins being produced then getting repeated
oxygen keeps things alivesugar keeps them feedcholyplast keeps them movingchloyphllkeeps them awake
the double helix of dna splits up and makes one strand of rna
the mrna takes the copy to the cytoplasm then it gives the copy to the trna the trna then takes it and makes a copy of it finally it is returned to the nucleus
1 mrna seperates from dna and leaves the nucleus2 the mrna gives information for making protein3 codon signals start to make amino acids for proteins4 sequence hits a stop codon and the protein is released into the cell
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it then goes out and gives the code to something else that blue print is then taken to the ribosomes to make the protein
1 mrna heads to the ribosome2 mrna gets decoded3 trna grabs an amino acid and brings it back to the decoded mrna4 rrna  is taken back to the nucleus
the mrna goes to the trna and they come together to make the proteins after this the rna link together to make dna
the mrna goes to the ribosomes to deliver the genetic code from the nucleus  the ribsomes connect the nucleic acids and send it to the golgi apparatus  then the gogli aparatus gets rid of the bad proteins  then gets the good proteins ready to be used in the cell
first the mrna leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm then it is bonded to a ribosome and it starts to decode the mrna next the different nucleic acids arrive and match up with the mrna codons last the amino acid is formed and the process continues at the endoplasmic reticulum where eventually all those amino acids make up a protein
the ribosomes create the protein
the mrna must first go to the ribosome then the ribosome makes what ever it was told to make after that trna come and transport the protien to its destenation
trnacopies amino acidssends it back to nucleusshares information
the 1st one would be mrna which carries instructions from the nucleus to the proteinthe 2nd one would be amino acids which is the sequence of a proteinthe 3rd one would be the protein would send a message back to the nucleusthe 4th one would be that mrna would go through the same process over
one is the passing over of a cell two is crossing over three is mrna leaving the minbran and four is where it reach it destinashion

the messenger rna leaves the nucleusthe proccess startsprotein is dividedthe proccess is ended
storing the protein making the protein using the protein and finding the protein
the mrna sends off the code to the mitochondria
first the mrna goes to a ribosome  it connects with the ribosome and then trna comes and connects with the ribosome  the trna reads the mrna and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mrna  this forms an amino acid  this continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mrna tells the trna to stop decoding
1the mrna will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus2 when the strand is translated trna will add anticodons to it3 trna will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand 4 the amino acids will bind creating a protein
during protein synethesis the dna is being replicated and forming mrna durning transcription then after it leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm translation takes place in the cytoplasm a polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins the trna carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mrna when that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids
1 the mrna takes the protein to the trna2 the trna transfers the protein into energy3 the mrna takes the energy back to the rrna4 the rrna stores the energy for when the organism needs it
step one would be  your body produces the protein step two would be th protein then travels through your blood stream step three  the protein makes more of itself on its way through the body  step four the protein finally reaches where its supposed to be
the four major steps interphase telophase anaphase and prophase
the first step in the  four major steps that involve in protein synthesis is the mrna goes from the nucleus to the cell membrain then the mrna goes to the cell nucleus and then the mrna goes to the cell nucleolus and last the cell goes to the cell nucleotide those are the four major steps in protein syntheses
mrna changes to amino acids the amino acids sends themselves to trna
the four major steps are prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
the mrna goes somewhere else where it can copy to make dna
translation  the dna is translated into rnatranscription  the rna is used in the celltrnarrna grna
first the mrna leaves the nucleus carrying a specific nucleotide the mrna passes the nucleotide to trna then trna carries 2 nucleotides to an rrna rrna completes the process with 3 nucleotides coding for a protein 
the g1 phase starts and then it continues on to the s phase  next the s phase turns into the g2 phase  then the last step is called the g0 phase  then it starts all over again
sugars
after mrna leaves the nucleus replication has occured it has four major steps involving its protein synthesis the mrna will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a trna with complimentary bases transcription occurs here the mrna is being transcribed then the trna undergoes translation with amino acids coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain this step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain when the chain of amino acids is complete elongation occurs where there is a stop codon and the sequencing will stop replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus234
step 1 the mrna leaves the nucleus step 2 the protein is sent to the ribosomes step 3  the protein is the synthesized and step 4 the mrna returns the synthesized protein to the nucleus
mrna copies its self with dna to make a codon strand mrna sends information to the trna the trna then translates the codons the rrna produces proteins
the mrna leaves the nucleus and then goes to the golgi apparatus it then goes to the lysosomes then finally goes to the nucleus again
go through the cell membranerush to the next cellenter the cellenter the nucleus to copy the protein and make a gene
1 when mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cell to a ribosome 2the mrna is then read by the ribosome 3the ribosome matches the mrna sequence with a complementary trna sequence which then codes for a specific protein 4the protein is then added to a chain which codes for specific genes
the first step is the replication in order to do that the mrna takes the information and gets it transfered tha is when the trna is used after it is replicated the extra that was not needed is gotten rid of
mrna rna rdna dna
trna rrna grna
it starts with the mrna leaving the nucleas delivering a message then the grna step in followed by the trna and eventually it ends with the rrna the final strand
four major steps involved in protein synthesis would be the making of new cells letting out what the cell doesnt need and the new proteins
trnarrnagrna mrna
after copying the dna sequence mrna leaves the nucleus of the cell the mrna then heads to a rrna where synthesis can begin the mrna feeds the code through the rrna based on what three bases you have in each segment a trna will bring that corresponding amino acid the amino acids form an amino acid chain which is also called a protein after the mrna has gone all the way through the last amino acid added is the stop amino acid after this process all three rnas have created a protein
mrna takes proteins to rrnasends copies to trnadepulicates
the mrna meats up with at the golgi aparatis and then rrna assembels the other side of the mrna and once that is done the new strand exits the cell
transcrpition translation trna carrying amino acids and anticodons enter and make a peptide chain peptide chain is formed when peptide bonds are added between the amino acids
it goes from mrna to trna then forms on amino acid

the mrna is translated into trna then the ribosomes helps with protein synthesis by transcribing the trna into amino acids which then are put together to make proteins which are then formed into polypeptides
they 4 steps are interphase anaphase metaphase and prophase
mrna leaving the nucleus  when it realeases itself from the nucleus and then it gose and makes more mrna and then makes more energy
mrna using protein synthesis is it could be split into 2 cells then made a copy of the other cell then started reproduction and then had started the process over again
mrna tells the body the of the need for proteinthe body responds to the message and starts the protein synthesis cyclethe body then makes the needed protein
it goes and gets changed into carbon through the carbon cycle
prophasemetaphaseanaphasetelephase

first mrna starts by creating a message that tells the other types of rna what they will be doing it creates a blue print for trna trna then carries the ammio acids with the anticoden to the rrna which makes up ribosomes and other proteins
it goes to trna which takes it to the mitochondira where it is transformed into rna

one thing that occurs is reproduction the coding may be different
give more infomation  move things in
the transfer the reading of the information the sending of the proteins and recieving
when mrna leavs the nucleus the mrna must find rhibosomes to tell them how to make protein when the mrna finds the rhibosomes the rna helps them make the protein one of the major steps is to find out what the mrna was told to do by the dna when the rhibosomes find out what the mrna has told them they go to work
it copys over and over to make more protein then
all the dnas steams are bein put together
your ribosomes would store energy and food it would store enough for them to require enough energy to make protines first they would gather energy from the organelles and then use rna to create the protines
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the trna then it goes into the golgi bodies and it is made into rna again
mrna is the messenger rna it sends information to the cells trna is the transfer rna it transfers cells rrna is the messenger rna grna
gathering sun light processing proteins dropping unwanted things
four major steps after mrna that invole protein synthesis are the nucleus and the codons are transferred they also start translation and transport
mrna leaves the nucleus     attaches to dna      rna segments in the cytoplasm      they attach to the mrna using covalent bonding     hydrogen bonds break split and repeat
the mrna leaves the nucleus an then goes to the trna where it transfers the information then it goes to the rrna
after leaving the nucleus the mrna has to carefully make its way to the site of the trna the next step is translation this step invloves the trna to translate the dna sequence on the mrna the third step is the trna making its way to the ribosomes this step is very important because this step is the step which almost finishes protein synthesis the last step is when the ribosomes do what the sequence of the dna says to do
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 mrna travels into the cytoplasm 3 mrna is translated into trna 4trna makes another strand to make another cell
goes through the cell membrane through the cell wall enters the endoplasma then enters the nuclei
transcription dna is transcribed into mrna so it can leave the nuclear membrane the mrna passes through the nuclear membranethe mrna travels on the endoplasmic riticulum to the ribosomethe ribosome reads the mrna to figure out what type of protein to make
the mrna leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm then it attaches to a ribosomes anti codons with amino acids come and attach themselves to the complemantary mrna codon then ceate trna
firstly the rna strand travels to the ribosomes secondly the start codon starts the building of the protein thirdly trna comes and builds the protein lastly the stop codon comes along and ends the production of the protein
the protien strand is readthen duplicatedmatched with another then paired into amino acids

1 the mrna unwinds and reveals inner chains2 new proteins are added and transcription takes place3 the proteins are reversed of their old proteins thymine is now adine4  the mrna is fixed and winds back up to become a new protein
it separates then replicates after leaving the nucleus
mrna leaves the nucleus then translates onto trna  the codons in the trna each code for a certain type of amino acid  that amino acid creates the necessary protein
the mrna leaves the nucleous and replicates the replicated mrna is then paired with a base pair that matches up to the end of the sequence

mrna leaves the nucleus goes to the place where the protein arrives then goes to the place where proteins gets stored after that they return to the nucleus and starts all over the next min and does it again

one major step involed in protein synthesis is when the food enters the cell the cell breaks it down and seperates the protein and the fatty foods
trna then attaches to the mrna matching its bases to those of the mrna  the segments formed by the mrna are called codons  these codons code for specific amino acids  the amino acids form a chain on the trna forming a protein

rrna then trna and dna
1  the mrna leaves the nucleus because the dna is to big to fit through the nucleaus pores2  the mrna then separates from the dna side3  a new strand of dna fills in on the old dna side4 a new complete strand of dna is formed
interphaseanaphaseprophasetelephase
ummcopy the strand of rna use bonds the connect the corrasponding nucleotides togetherno cluethe process starts all over again
the first step is dna spliting into two single strand rna  the next step is the rna leaving the nucleus  third it must find a copy of another rna to link it with the other  finally the codons are linked and you have a protein
translation is where protein language is translated into amino acid language so they can understand it to make new proteins transcription is where they are taken from one place to another for protein synthesis rna has to fit into holes where dna cannot to make protein synthesis the last way is when dna is made into rna with mrna to make new proteins when it is made into rna that is making new proteins
1the mrna travels to a ribosome 2the codons on the mrna signal for an amino acid3translationtrna match up an amino acid to each codon on the mrna starting with the start codon4terminationthe amino acids are matched up with the codons on the mrna until the stop codon is reached which signals the end of translation
once mrna leaves the nucleus then trna does its job after trna then the rna is almost all the way done with producing protein after two more steps the rna is done with making the proteins and that is what protein synthesis is
the mrna than goes over to the dna and come together than trna begins to transfer the data onto the dna to begin to create proteins once the dna gets it it begins to create protein last when finished the rrna breaks off and than starts all over
it goes and get blood cells
the rna leaves the nucleus and then it goes into the cell membrane when it is there it then startes to break down and turn into protein when it is done there the protein then goes throughout the entire cell
the are read 3 at a timethey then turn into amino acids they make amino acid chainthen fix the problem
splicing and then it is transferd
mrna takes instructions out of the nucleus trna makes the codons rrna tells the codons what amino acids they are
mrna leaves the nucleus then goes to the ribosomes gets protein then goes to the golgi apparatus puts them in their and goes back to the nucleus
copying prophase anaphase metaphase
mrna occurs transfering over to trna while entering the nucleus and dividing into its own parts of rna
its tells what protiens  to make and it makes it
the four major steps to involved in protein synthesis are
the mrna matches up with the others
it then goes through the dna to the rna and out to the trna which transfers it to the cellular membrane
1 the mrna goes through the cells and meets the trna2 the trna matches up its nucleotides with those of the mrna3 the trna gives the mrna an amino acid sequence4 steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the trna reaches a stop codon at the end of the mrna sequence
mrna will go to a ribisomtrna will conect to the mrnathe mrna will brack away from the ribosomethe mrna will fold into complex 3d shapes
after mrna leaves the nucleus there are four major steps that go on in order for proteins to function properly                the mrna travels from the nucleus to the ribosome where ribosmal rna is present also known as rrna the rrna then goes to the nuclues where proteins are stored then the amino acids bond and then you have a protein     that is the complete protein synthesis
its made in the ribosomesthe ribosomes carry it through the cellthe ribsome enters the nuclusthe golgi apperatus takes the waste out of the nucleus and the cell
light photosynthesis reprodution
mrna travels to a trna and relays that message then the trna starts to copy the mrna so the cell can have a replicate the new mrna travels to ribosomes the ribosomes begin to make the protein
1 a ribosome attaches to the mrna rrna translation occurs2 codons are coded for a specific amino acid3 anticodons that are in the trna are paired with the codons in the mrna 4 peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured new proteins are made
first transcription takes place where the mrna is copied then in translation the rna has a set of directions that are translated and tell the ribosomes how to make the protein
mrna leaves the nucleus  next it goes into the golgi aparatus  then it starts making amino acids  after that the ribosomes start making the protein
the first step of protein synthesis is when mrna is sent to a new dna strand  the mrna is then attached to the dna strand  the trna is then sent to the strand and the genetic sequences are transferred  you then have a new strand of dna that is a replicate of the old strand
trna translates the mrna strand into a polypeptide strand that polypeptide strand makes up a protein that protein helps with cell life processes and the mrna strand is translated over and over again
once mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to a mitocondria and by using translation the information is passes to a trna which is then used in making proteins the codons match up with the anticodons that then allows the creation of proteins
codons come and break the rnas code down three at a time mutations occure the codon takes that code and makes proteins your body uses those proteins
the mrna leaves the nucleus then
codons are made on the rna strandthe codons are tranferred to amino acidsthe amino acids make proteinsthe stop codon is used to stop the production of more amino acids
after the mrna leave the nucleus the
the mrna leaves the nucleus it then translates the rna form amino acids and then protien is made
first mrna leaves the nucleus with the dna sequence  then the mrna meets up with the trna and the trna takes and makes the new strand  then the mrna leaves with the new strand  the final step is that new proteins are made
the mrna takes the rna to trna where they transfer it to dna and back then they take it to drna where they do something
they combine with each otherit makes it harder and more densethey go evolve into different formsmakes the mrna  more tense
mrna goes to the dna and makes a copy of the dna the mrna then gives the information to the trna which delivers the information to the rrna the rrna then makes the protiens in the ribose of the cell creating new protien
1 translation goes to the trna tells it what it needs2 rna processing3 the trna combines the protien to copy the mrna brought out of the nuecleous with hydrogen bonds4 the rrna takes it out of the cell and places it where it is needed
take the a and change it to u and take the s and make it t take the g and change it to c take the c and chang it to g
changing from dna to mrna to trna to grna
metaphase prophase telophase and anaphase
with protein synthesis first the mrna leaves the nucleus then the mrna duplicates itself then it travels back to the nucleus as trna and reattaches itself with the mrna there is a copied strand and a original strand on each of the now two pairs
proteinprotein is let off into the bodyprotein increases the bodies energyprotein causes the body to stay in shape
four major steps involved are breaking everything down making sure it travels to the correct place getting everything else ready and making everything all over again
mrna leaves the nucleus and travels through the cell with the dna information the dna holds the material necessary for making protein after passing through the cell the material from the dna is transformed into a protein
mrna attaches to dnadna sequencingamino acids are produced
rrna decrypts mrnatrna gets amino acids to make the protien
they need to go through the process of mrna trna and dna to finish all the process of the mrna
1 brings the mrna to a ribosome to be remade2 mrna goes in ribosome on one end3 trna then comes witha codon oposite of the original and places it together4 the trna leaves and mrna moves to next codon needing to me matched by trna the next correct trna links onto the last one creating the protein
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein trna takes instructions to the protein

the mrna leaves the cell and enters the cytoplasm it carries the information of the cell and for the nucleic acid sequence of a protien it then reenters the cell and trna begins the trna attatches to a ribosome and copies the information while this is happening rrna is producing more ribosomes for the process to happen again

when mrna leaves the nucleus the four major steps involved in protein synthisis are spliting copying forming a new strand and putting it all back together
after the mrna leaves the nucleus then ribosomes attach to the endoplasmic reticullum than it is moved throughout cells to build the protein number back up
the protien reprduces and it makes more
first trna makes the message then mrna takes the messages to the ribosomes then rrna tells the ribosomes to make the protienthen the protein is made by the ribosomes
the rna  leaves the the nucles by exiting the membrane form their the cell wall
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
mrna is then translated into trna and taken back into the nucleous and made into strand of dna which is attached to the original strand of dna
telaphase metaphase anaphase and prophase
gathering distributing using and exiting
1 the mrna travels to the protien making part of the cell2 the protien making part of the cell takes the instructions and makes a protien3 the protien is uneque and goes to a part of the body to help4 the protien makes a structure with other protiens that oare similar to it

splitting this is where the strand is straightened outpeeling this is where the nucleotides are splitmatching this is where new nucleotides are put onreattachment this is where the mrna is put back together
the mrna enters the cytoplasm the mrna attaches to ribosomes then an anticodon transport rna attaches to the mrna codons matching the sequence of nucleotides the process shifts and continues to produce proteins
mrna changes to rna which codes to dna and turns in to amino acid
through photosynthesis
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to to other cells in the organism and does what it had to to in the nucleus
rna
to take messages through the body
interphase prophase anaphase and telophase
protein blood cells cell wall ribosome and others but i cant remember right now
first a strand of dna is formed then the stand of dna breaks apart new dna attaches to both pieces of the dna another step involves rna but that happenes after the other steps have occured
mrna leaves the nucleus and trna steps in to translate the sequencerrna create ribosomes for the sequence along with realting to amino acidsthe sequence is let out of the cellit goes off into the organisms body
it first starts out when something needs repaired then thats when the dna sends signals to start a recreation of something the body needs so what happens is that mrna comes into effect then thats when dna creates mrna thats when mrna goes to what needs to be fixed and gives it protien to do so and mrna is small enough to fit threw the holes thats in a nucleus
anaphase telephase metaphase mitophase
transcription the mrna changes formduplication the rna strand is duplicated and then forms new segments of rna which code for dnatranslation the mrna meets up at the ribosome and trna are produced
mrna takes protein to dna strand coping it and making new
mrna leaves nucleus leaves with information on how to make the proteins information is translated proteins are made
mrna sends a message to protein wich makes them multiply into more protein
after the mrna leaves the fist step is to go through the cell and deliver the message that is coded in the rna to the right parts it first has to transfer the rna into codons so that the message will be readable to the parts next it has to deliver the message to the right place in the cell it then goes back to recive more messages so that it can transfer the message and start again
the mrna leaves the nucleus and then from there it delivers the message to wherever it is supposed to then attaches to the dna strand
the mrna makes another copy of itsself making trna
first dna responsible for this unzip and nitrogen bases pair up with the dna bases the mrna takes this section to trna to form codons that can be used in protein synthesis the codons are matched up with anticodons at ribosomes and amino acids are made from these when the amino acids are completed and form the right chain they are traken and used for their needed purpose
mrna gives the information to the trna who translates it and shows it to the rrna who builds the protein
1 they have no organism 2 they have no air3 they get no water4 they have no shelter
during protein synthesis the mrna first leaves the nucleus  it then goes on to the golgi apparatus  the next step is the endoplasmic reticulum er  after the mrna leaves the er it makes its way to the nucleus
the mrna would leave the nucleus and find another piece of rna to connect with to make a new strand then itd go back into the nucleus and then repeat this cycle throughout time
there is mrna leaving nucles then travolin to midocondra then bracking down and last it is ready for use
the four major steps of protein synthesis is anaphase telophase prophase and interphase
it forms from dna then it forms protiens
the four major steps of protein synthesis are cell respiration meiosis miosis and cell division
mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the trna which is also called transport rna the trna gives the intructions for making the protien
the four major steps in protein synthesis are prophase metaphase anaphase telophase
one the gain energy and the nthey use that energy to build up protein synthesis it thens to made intop protein and then it goes into protein synthesis
the first major ste
the mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome there the mrna then tell the trna the code to create the proteins then the trna starts to make the protiens and finally the proteins are sent out to do their job
mrna messages the trna of the new protein which then transports the protein through the kaleb cycles to be built for a specified reason
one major step with mrna leaving the nucleus involved in protein synthesis is when rna carries intructions from nucleus to amino acid protien takes the mrna and uses it on the body for energy
first major step is going through the nucleas the second major step is golgi apparatus third major step is rough erand the fourth major step is going through the mitochondria the mitochondria packages it and distributes
cell seperates the cells mutate
anapahse tealphaseprophasecytokinesis
it goes to the trna and then that goes to a nucleotide which then goes through the membrane or ribosome and it travels towards the end of the membrane or ribosome and finally leaves the cell
firtst mrna leaves the nucleus and attaches iself to a free ribosome then the sequence has amino acids come and are attached by an enzyme to the rna strand and after the protein stand has been made the rna releases itself from the ribosome so the process can be repeated
the mrna has to carry the message that protein synthesis should occur then the chemicals start going that tell the protein synthesis object to startonce that starts it does protein synthesislastly protein synthesis has been done
telophase anaphase metaphase and mitosis
protein synthesis is made up of four major steps the first is to recieve a message for action the second is to prepare to react thirdly you send the message forthly you actually do whatever is needed such as a message sent to another cell or cell group

mrna leaves the nucleusit enters a protein cellit feeds itmrna goes back into nucleus
prophoes metephase annphase ans tellphase
trna matches its anticodons with mrna codons trna gets the corresponding amino acid then brings the acid back to the corresponding mrna
1 mrna attatchs itself to a ribosome 2 mrna discloses the genetic information to the ribosome3 the corresponding nucleotides are put together with the information4 the new chain becomes the new protein
the mrna leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm  there it attaches to a ribosome  attatched to the ribosome rrna comes and brings different codons for amino acids from the mrna strand to the trna strand  the ribosome moves down the trna strand  the codons attach to the anticodons of the trna strand  as this occurs ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein  when the rrna brings a stop codon the process ends and the strand containing the protein brakes off to form the actual amino acid for the cell
mrna trna and the nucleus work to transfer and translate the codes to genetic information for mutations and genetic traits
mineral vitiminm iron zinc
first it takes the instructions from the nucleus for a sequence of amino acidsecond it brings them back to the ribosomes and starts protein synthesisthird the ribosomes start to synthesize protein using the instructionsfourth they release the proteins after synthesizing them
first mrna leaves the nucleus after being transcribed from half a single strand of dna then the small and large ribosomes come attach to the rna to translate it the codons are then translated into a certain amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon this happens multiple times until there is a long chain of amino acids that make a protein
translation which is when the dna spilts and forms a rna strand on the cytoplasm transcription which is when dna is copied and kept in the nucleus where the process takes place transformation which is when protiens make a double helix strand of dna there is also meiosis which is when two cells are split into four dipliod daughter cells
four major steps are that interphase takes place this is where the cell completely splits then there is rrna which relays the message to let them know what is happening there is anaphase which is where the cell starts to divide then there is also telophase where the cells nucleotides start to get sent over to the other side of the cell
it sends messages to the brainmrna tells the body to react to anything importanthelp maintain the cells
 it has to be broken down to make the protein sythesis
when mrna leaves the nucleus there are four major steps that are involved in protein synthesis the first step is when the messenger rna replicates then the cell divides into two identical daughter cells that both contain the same sequence of rna the cells then divide one last time and four daughter cells are created
1 prophase the mrna is prepared for interphase2 interphase the mrna in torn apart3 anaphase the strands are pulled together at the center of the cell4 telophase two new daughter rna molecules are formed

mrna trna
mrna takes genetic information out of the celltrna brings amino acids with complementary codons to attach      to the mrna strandtrna balances the chemical amounts that come with the amino acidsa protein is created with the new nucleotide sequence
four major steps are1them forming things around them2they work together3they 4
1 the protein gets carried to the necleus2 there the protein gets copied3 new dna is formed4 the protein is used for engergy
mrna transfer information to trna and then to the main cells in the body for the signal to be required
prophase metaphase telophase anaphase
mrna turns into trna when it goes to the rough er and then gets the proper enzymes and goes back to the nucleus to be paired up with the dna and replace the rna stand need to be replaced
one step is that the cells in mrna are copiedanother step is once the mrna leaves the nucleus it turns to rnaa third step is the rna changes its sugar to ribose
it attaches on to amino acids
first the mrna has to travel to the other end of the body then it has to fight off the evil space invaders from the planet cortex after that is done it goes back to its apartment i the vrain and calculates how long it will take to split a protein in half then there is a ninja fight scene between the mrna and a protein which ends by the mrna karate chopping the protein in half and that is how protein synthesis is done
1 when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the trna to deliever a message 2 when the mrna gets to the trna it delievers the message that it needs to the trna needs to carry the instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of the protein3 then when the trna delievers that information the rrna will take over and put the amino acids in sequence  4 then the trna will deliver the protein where it needs to go
the four major steps are that the mrna leaves the nucleus carrying information to make protein  the mrna lands on the rrna and waits for the trna to bring amino acids  the trna brings the amino acids which the mrna lines up to make a complete protein
after mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna will go to a ribosome  after the mrna is at the ribosome it will enter the ribosome  after the mrna has entered the ribosome it will share the genetic information it is carrying with the trna  after the trna has the genetic information the trna will start bringing in amino acids to great proteins
mrna takes it to the brain brain takes it inthe brain sends out organisms to fight itthe fighters destroy it
the mrna is the taken to be used by trna and mrna then it is lined in rows of codons then the trna and mrna form together to read and transfer the message for mrna message this is all otherwise known as translation
1 mrna leaves nucleus through a nuclear pore2 trna comes carrying the complementary codon and amino         acid3 as the trna creates amino acids rrna moves along the            strand after each amino acid is complete after a new amino        acid is created it binds to the previous one forming a peptide      bond4 when the trna encounters a stop codon the amino acid            chain is complete
then the mrna goes to the lysosomes to produce proteins for the cell to use
1 is the nucleus2 is the cytoplasm3is nucleouous4core
it splitsit makes dna it helps make copies travels where needed
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are the stages of mitosis prophase metaphase anaphase and telophasein the process of mitosis the cell parts work together to move to the edges of the cell pull apart divide and start all over as daughter cells

the mrna goes out of the nucleus and tell the rna to make protien and then protien synthesis happensidk
1 the dna is unzipped as the hydrogen bonds are broken2 the dna is replicated on each side3 two new strands are present
prophase anaphase metaphase and telophase
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through many stagesit passes through the mitochondriait turns it into an atp
the first step is mrna leaving the nucleus then the coded instructions for creating proteins are translated to trna next amino acids are produced to make the protein finally the amino acids are combined to make the protein coded for by the mrna from the nucleus
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are gathering the proteins sortting them packing them and sending them out
the protein obsorb energy from the sun it produces sugars proteins are made energy is stored
mrna leaves the nucleus carrying with it the coding recieved from the dna trna carrying amino acids then mitochondria cytoplasm assembly substances protein
after it gives its message it will gointo the body
trnarrnagrnamrna
mrna gose to the binding site with the insturtctions for building the protien then trna takes that over to the chromomes and they corss over
when the first step of the mrna has left the nucleus  the second step of this is when the mitochondria takes all the proteins in the body and packages them up and ships them somewhere else then the lysosomes take the protein and keep them with other proteins that have been packaged
the mrna has to chang into trna then trna has to change to rrna then the codons are decoded and changed in to aminoacids
after the mrna leaves the nucleus the trna begins to transfer the information to the rrna to begin to make a new strand and then it goes in and looks for any missing parts or if the letters got switched around to fix it
trna
1it has to change then enitre thing234
they leave and go to the ribosomes they produce new dna they send it back to the nucleus they produce new dna
it go and gets the trna
mrnatranscriptionrnaanabodiescodonstranslationtrna
1 mrna leaves the cell2 the ribazome reads each segment    3 as the segments are read amino acids coding for each segment come down to the ribazome4 the amino acids attach to each other to form a protein
1 the mrna gives the code tothe trna2 the trna goes and gets the other half of the dna strand3the dna strand is finished copying4 the dna molecules are paired with amino acids
it leaves the nucleus it transfers to the mitochondria
the mrna copies the dna then it seperates and an amino acid goes through the last step is that it comes back together
after mrna leaves the nucleus it tells the transport rna to bring nucleotides to the active site for synthesis  proteins and amino acids are also brought to the active site  the messenger rna tells the existing proteins how to make the neccessary new protein and synthesis begins atp is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction  the protein is then finished and the messenger rna notifies the nucleus of the completion
the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria
then you get trna then dna
protein is transferredprotein is given a more higher level of itself makes it strongerprotein then makes its way to the rna to keep healthy
they go through transcription the dna splits into to so it unwinds its self and splits now its mrna and it has to split to fit through the passage way out of the nucleus then it foes down into the ribosomes here it uses translation and copies itsleft into dna again and makes protines the mrna carries intructions for dna
as mrna leaves the nucleus it sends it to the trna to get transfered onto the rna sequence and be seperated into codons and read into amino acids the rrna does the reading and after it is read sends these codes of sequences into a polypeptide chain to then be transfered back into the dna sequence
mrna translates the dna adn then slides pass the dna on to the rna delivering the coded information needed
1 mrna meets with rrna2 trna brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis3 rrna reads mrna and codes for the amino acids needed 4 an amino acid chain forms
the mrna enters the ribosomestart codon enters p site second codon at a sitetrna adds a amino acid to the codon at the p site and a sitethe p site codon breaks apart and the codon at the a site takes its place and the process continues until you hit a stop codon the chain of amino acids creates a protein
mrna leases the nucleus and signals certain pathways which then signal for cerain ribosomes to release and help synthesize proteins rrna then codes for trna to transfers certain ribosomes to the receptors for the creation of proteins
mrna leave the nucleus and goes to where ever it has to dump the stuff that it has then it goes back to the nucleus to get more
it conjoines with another dna and starts the process of mitosis and then it seperated and breakes off to go make more and replicate
the mitochondian breaks down the protiens then it is filtered through the body and into the blood the protiens are used to supply energy to the body
anaphase telephase prophase metaphase
mrna goes into the cytoplasm to the ribosomesthe mrna is copied and can become trnathe trna is made into a copyable strand of dnathe dna is taken back to the nucleus
the mrna takes the proteins then goes to another cell and transfers the protein to that cell then it rides to the nucleus and dumps off the information it is carrying then it dies
the mrna leaves the dna and finds a ribisom there it is copied and reproduced
1 prophase2 interphase3 anaphase4 metaphase
1 the mrna attaches to a dna sequence 2 that dna sequence seperates3 codons attach to the two new dna strands and match them identical4 the two new strands are checked over to insure there were no wrongly placed codons

mrna leaves the nucleus and ends up at the cytoplasm it goes through a few steps but i honestly dont know remember them
threw the tubes past the antibodies past the proteins and past the cells
identifictation replication transition synthesis
1 find anything that shouldnt be there for ex germs bacteria etc 2 report it to proteins3 they get rid of bacteria
it protects strengthens distributes and stores proteins to make them more effective and last longer
the protien is transferd
mrna attatches to a ribosome then the ribosome makes the protein its told to make after that the protien is sent to the rough er then after that it is altered a little bit and sent out to the golgi apparatus then the golgi apparatussends the protien to where it has to go and then the protien starts doing its job
mrna delivering the instructions to the dna then the dna makes protiens
the mrna leaves the nucleus with the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein it then transfers the instructions to the trna to start the sequence with the information it has it makes the sequence until it gets the codone to stop
the four major steps are one they find the main good cells that are good to reproduce other good cells second they go into anapahase to make the process of making proteins faster third is that when they are done with anaphase they go inside of each others cells and start making proteins inside them fourth is that the protein comes out and there is a good protein that just got made
1mrna start a process called translation2trna bring adenine uracil cytosine and guanine to the site3the bases are attached to the mrna creating a nucleotide4the nucleotides are folded into their proper shape
first mrna leaves the nucleus to go to get copied while getting copied they split in half and those halves get identical matchers now there is two sets of the same protien these protien go back to the cells where they are used then will start the process all over agian
the mrna gives the information to the trna the trna then translate the information for the rrna the rrna translates the information once again then the rrna has the amino acid which is given back to the nucleus
the mrna brings instructions to the amino acids the rrna carries out the instruction with the amino acids proteins are then created the trna transfers the protein back into the cell through the membrane
os it the answer  is dna
1 goes through a pore2 meets with transfer rna3 connets with a ribosome4 returns to the nucleus
translation transcriptionreplication
it makes a copy of its self like for a new strand because they do have one strand and dcopy and find the ones that match it because there is no longer anymore thymine because thymine turns into urical and i dont remember the rest sorry
the mrna goes to the dna and uses the trna to transfer the genetic code to the dna so that it could be passed on by sexual reproduction in the sex organs or maybe even just to make more dna cells
mrna delivers the plans for the construction of rna trna brings the various materials for the construction of rna rrna produces rna rna goes out of the ribosome
it decreases
transcriptiontranslation
the four major steps are the mrna traveling around the other organelles will work together they will then try to do something that helps the cell and then the protein will synthesize
the mrna the transports information then gains a new half to become dna then it copies itself again afterwords it transports the information to genes
it enters the nucleusit lines up across the center of the nucleusit seperatesit then begins protein synthesis
after the mrna leaves it goes to the ribosome and the trna brings amino acids to the mrna
1 it leaves2 it travels3 it asks for directions4 it arrives
sends messages to the braingives out informationtells cells what to dodelivers to its destination
mrna is then transferred onto trna which makes a complimentary strand then trna moves into the protein making organelle where the codons are then turned into amino acids which creates proteins
1 mrna transfers the message2 something packages it3 something receives it4 the task is done
the creation developing the protein and sending it out of the nucleus
1ribosomes will translate mrna into protiens2then protiens go through the krebs cycle3then the protiens are changed into atp4electron chain transporter takes the atp somewhere where the atp will be used
the rna controls everything
instuctions come form the nucleas and with amino acids go to build protein with help from the mrna
mrna leaves the nucleus then activly transported across the cellnext the mrna is taken to an amino acid and given energythe mrna then enters the mitochondria where it is transformed into a protein this happens because of ribosomes acting on the mrna
the four major steps are1 sending the mrna to the cytoplasm2 the rna getting copied to make dna3 mrna gets sorted to make different body parts4 the rna does to the amino acids
1 mrna leaves the nucleus to find the golgi apparatus out in the cells cytoplasm2 once the golgi apparatus has the orders from the mrna to build a new protein it starts3 the newly formed protein exits the golgi apparatus and floats freely in the cytoplasm4 the protein is picked up and then put to work throughout the cell usually in the membrane
the mrna leaves the nucleus and gets read and then tranlslated itno rrna and hen it goes back itno the nucleaus
1 replication2 34
prophase anaphase telephase metaphase
goes from one to the other travels through the body comes back and does it all over again
distributionreproduction messaging
in the protein synthesis it goies into different steps to be fully developed the protein has to get every where in the cell body it translocates
first the dna has to break apart into seperate strands for the mrna to copy the dnas information  then the mrna will begin to copy the dna  a will become u t will become a c will become g and g will become c after the mrna has copied the information it will break from the dna and send the information off to the nucleus dna will rejoin into the double helix once more
the messenger rna send the message throught the cellanaphase interphasprophasemetaphase     proteins are made up of amino acids that are made up of dna
1mrna leaves the nucleus2it carries it to the ribosomes3trna then  transfers the sequence 4then amino acids then split into separate proteins
mrna leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis from the nucleus the first step includes the mrna attatching to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the form of ribosomes the second step is for the mrna to be copied to trna trna is a complimentary copy to mrna the third stepthe trna is copied into a complimentary rrnathe codons are read and ready for synthesis the fourth step includes the assembly of the protein beginning with a start amino acid and ending with a stop amino acid
after the mrna leaves the cell nucleus it goes to the rrna once the rrna has the information it will start making protiens and their codons after codons and proteins are made the cell now has new dna
interphase anaphase metaphase telephase
code attaches to chromosome the chromosome sends message to dna
1 it leaves the nucleus 2 travels out through the cell 3 it transfers to trna 4 moves back to the nucleus
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through two cells then the trna comes and make matches with the floting letters from there the amino acids are created and they make a peptide bond and the strand goes away to become dna
mrna leaves the nuclease and finds a protein then trna makes a copy of the mrna and sends it out into the cell
1 mrna floats to a ribosome rrna in the cytoplasm and reads three bases codon2 trna matches up with proper amino acids and then pulls its amino acids to the ribosome and lines up its anitcodons with the codons3 rna moves forward and realeases three bases at a time and the trna then realeases its amino acids and drifts away4 the amino acids bond peptide bond and form a chain of amino acids which is now a protein the protein then goes and does its job in the body
1 the mrna sends a message to tell the body what protein to make2 the body makes the protein
there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis the creation of mrna the creation of the protein the polishing of the protein and packaging of the protein  the first step the creation of mrna takes placei n the nucleus  the nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases adenine cytosine guanine thymine and uracil floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm  it uses adenine a cytosine c guanine g and uracil u to make mrna  first the dna unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein  then the trna reads the dna creating the mrna by matching up the a c g and tthymine on the dna with the u g c and a on the mrna respectivelythe second step the creation of the protein takes place in the cytoplasm on a ribosome  the rrna in the ribosome reads the mrna to decide what amino acids to use  the mrna consists of codons sets of three nitrogenous bases which correspond to a specific amino acid  the ribosome creates a long amino acid chain known as a polypeptide chainthe third step the polishing of the protein takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum er  after the polypeptide chain floats over to the er the er puts the finishing touches on the chainthe fourth step the packaging of the protein takes place in the golgi apparatus  the golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell  then the protein is sent to the part of the body where its needed
mrnatrnarrnagrna
the first major step is intersphase which get the body started  then there is metaphase which brings in the nurtients  next is anaphase which seperates the nutrients  lastly theres propshase which uses up all the proteins and completes the process
after mrna leaves the nucleus it attaches to a ribosome the mrna contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon transfer rna carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mrna the codon and anticodon bind and form an amino acid more and more trna molecules bring anticodons to the mrna codons which produce a growing polypeptide chain this chain will be a protein
to travledblad streemto get to dna
the bosy have to boned together ti make sure that it kill off the bad things
when the mrna leaves the nucleus the codons move down one place then another codon comes on the end and that is called the stop codon after that the process starts again
1 finding the protiens2
the mrna goes rrna and gives them instruvtions from dna for the amino acid sequence  ribosomal rna makes the ribosomes trna puts the proteins into order to match them up with their correct codon prpteins match up with the correct codon which makes the identical sequence to what dna needs
1 the mrna send information to the rrna to tell it to make amino acids2 the rrna makes the amino acids3 the amino acids are then made into rna by trna4 then the dna and rna com together
the mrna finds a dna strandit attaches to the strandit begins to copy the protiensit takes the copies back to the cell
antaphaseinterphasemetaphaseprophase
the mitochondriachloroplast ribsomes and protein
the mrna delivers the pportion of dna to the ribosome that then goes through the process of copping the seguence into rna then making amino acids that are finally sent to the mitochondria to be stored
after mrna the protine begeins ti divide then it follows the dna blueprint to construct a new protien then the prosses repetes it self
interphase telophase prophase and anaphase
1 first it tells what is happening to the golgi apparatus2it goes to mrna to try and find the protein synthisis
mrna leaves the nucleus to collect data and brings it back into the cell after that the dna is replicated following this step the trna transfers the dna onto the replication ribosomes hold the replica into place as it transfers
1 mrna2 dna3 trna4 nucleus
protein synthesis1 the proteins find a mate2 the proteins reproduce to make more proteins3 then the proteins spread out4 and make more
mrna leaves the nucleusit transfers all of the protienmaking instructions to the other parts of the body
mrna trna rrna
the protein is copied by the rrna then it is transcribed by the trna the the mrna takes the trancribes copy to the amino acid sequence of a protein then the body makes a new starnd of rna
mrna leaves the nucleusmrna transfers the nucleic sequence to the trnait is then paired with the opposite nucleic materialsthen its copied and pasted
mrna tranfers to trna and that tranfers to rrna which transfers to grna
the other strand will repeat the process and replicate into another strand of mrna and continue the process over and over again
it goes through the cytoplasm then into the cell membrane  after that it goes through a process and then it goes out of the cell
messanger rna to endoplacium reticulum to ribosomes then attaches to wall
the mrna transports messages through out the body to perform protien synthesis the body then performs protien synthesis
trna idk
the four  majior parts are mrna because sends a message to the dna then theres rrna which takes the message back to the dna  then theres
absorbing proteins
the nucleous gets the information to send out to tell what the cell needs then the mrna take that information and gives it to the ribosome then the ribosome makes that information then the ribosome puts that information into a strand that looks like a sipper
the first step is trnathe second step is rrnathe third step is mrnathe last step is grna
4 major steps are
the cell cycle
one step is when the mrna goes out of the nucleus another step is the mrna travels through ribosomes the next step is the mrna gets its second strand the final step is the mrna is now a complete chromosome
1 interphase lead to metaphase were the cell starts to copy cell anaphase brings the cytopasma and spindle to form new copies prophase spites the cell into new dauter cells
1 reproduction2 crossingover3replication4 becoming a new cell
four major steps are crossing over movement mitosis and meiosis
the ribosome comes to the mrna strand  then two rrna molecules start to decode the strand  as it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome  when it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mrna strand
first is translation to become mrna then it will leave the cell and go to first a ribosome then to a mitochondria the mitochondria will then form the mrna into a protein
step 1    the first step is the bodie goes diffusion then the bodie gets rid of the extra strand then i new strand unzips then turns into a goldgi bodie
it then goes to the ribosomes codons then match the anticodons brought by the trna every anticodon brings with it an amino asid that corresponds with the secuance of the nitrogonous basesthe amino acid is made and once the stop codon is pus onthe protein goes
one would be er that attach to ribsomes which produce proteins and proteins help your body
prophase metaphaseanaphasetelophase
one step is mrna being rememberedsecond step is the proteins being madethird step is the proteins being releasedfourth step is the proteins being used as energy
mrna leaves the nucleustmrna binds with the rrnatrna codes for the new amino acidamino acids join and create protein
it goes away and sends signals to the rest of the body if something is hurt or if everything is ok
mrna brings the plans to the structure
first mrna leaves the nucleus after that the mrna develops into a sequence by which we call a codon after the codon is made the sequence is made into amino acids after the amino acids are made proteins are made
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to rrna rrna then makes replicas of the dna and trna takes it to the organells to follow the instructions
four major steps involved in protein synthesis is
the mrna goes to the cytoplasm to look for a ribosome     the mrna is then read by the rrna     the rrna tells the trna witch amino acid to bring      the trna brings the amino acids to the ribosome where the amino acids will be assembled into proteins
the first major step is transcription of mrna
the mrna leaves the nucleusthe mrna tells the stuff where to goit goes therethe stuff gets there
copy and moltuply to make more rna or dna
mrna leaves the nucleus then your protein comes in after that your cells divide and then they go to yuor membrane
mrna trna rrna grna
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are the collecting of proteins assortment of sugers copying of protein and the organization of the new protein
it goes through the chain and then goes throuth the atp synthase then it comes out of the transport chain
leaves the neucleusattaches itself to a ribosomereaches mitochondrionbegins protein synthesis
desises
after the mrna leaves the nucles it goes through four major steps involved with protein synthesis firts it goes through transcription and is changed into dna
transfering information to the cellgetting rid of all the bad proteinsgathering good proteinputting it in a certain place in the cell
first the trna carries the mrna from the nucleus to the lysosomes then the lysosomes follow the instructions on the mrna to make amino acids after the amino acids are made they form together to form a protein the the protein is released into the endoplasmic reticulum and the process starts all over again
first the mrna is released into the body then the mrna attaches itself to ribosomes thirdly the mrna grows to the biggest size in can go lastly when the mrna is done growing it will be delivered to the lysosome where it will be disposed of
interphasemetaphaseprophaseanaphase
starting with mrna it reads the bonds like instructions then sends this to the nuclesous to get transfered into the second strain after that it is transfered to the rna strain which is turned into the last form then is hocked to the hydroxide bonds
messager rna leaves the nucleus and gives the cells the message of what amino acids that they code forthen the codons gather together and make the correct codons it leaves and goes back to the nuclueus and creates the correct proteins with the codons it has
1 mrna leaves2 oxygen enters3 water enters4 protein is synthesised
after mrna leaves the nucleus after going through the process of trancription where the rna polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves the mrna goes to the ribosome translation occurs when trna makes a copy of the dna segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mrna strand the complementary base pairs start to link onto the mrna strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented then the trna brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mrna strand
mrna changes to trna and travels through the golgi apparatus then goes to the lysosome where it is translated and amino acids are then put into packages and sent off as protiens
mrna trna rrna
the mitochondria absorbs the sun light to create food the foodlysosomes is sent to the endoplasmic reticuilum to create the protiens then the waste from the endoplasmic reticulum is sent to the golgi apparatus to get wasted
the acgu is a thing that has rna for the telephase
the mrna leaves the nucleus then the mrna goes to the ribosomes  the mrna is then translated into dna  the dna makes a strand of proteins
it gets the message from the brian n takes it to its distenation
the proteins are leaving the cell
trna    rrnagrnamrna
the mrna then goes to the ribosomes  from the ribosomes it goes to the er  then the er takes it to the cell membrane and then it goes throught the cell membrane out into the body
prophase new cell is formed    metaphase sister chromatids line up in the middle of the cell    anaphase cell starts to divide     telephase cell divides and reproduces
mrna leaves nucleusmrna is decoded and transported by the trnaamino acid is formedprotein is made
the first step is that the protien unzips the mrna the next step is that it takes out any kind of trash that it may have next the protien comes back and zips it back up the last step is that it sends it back from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
when mrna leaves the nucleus it travels 1st to the mitocondria then it goes to the flagellums after that it goes to be bonded with amino acids and lastly it is changed into protein
the mrna gets transformed into another type of rna that new rna is use to make genetic information that strand of genetic information gets a complementary strand both of the strands get paired up and they make a segment of dna
glyklous
the mrna hookes up to the dna to make a protein it then distconect from the dna after that it goes to make a trna finally it starts offer
the mrna gives information to the nucleus  the protein is formed from this information
1 interphase        2 prophase3anaphase4metaphase
the first step is the mrna going to the ribosome the mrna is then turned to trna after going through transcription after translation the trna is turned into codons which code for amino acids
trna rrna
mrna to give the instructions on how to make the protiens trna to transfer the protien molecules rrna for ribosomes to help make the protien grna
it leaves the nucleus and then goes trhough the ionic channels
the mrna transcribes then translates and later forms protiens
the mrna is attached to the corresponding anticodons  it then makes proteins
mrna turns into dna
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus and searches for a ribosome2 the mrna finds a ribosome and attaches to it3 the mrna is decoded by trna via base pairing rules and the amino acids previously synthesized are brought in as indicated by the mrna4 the ribosome moves on down the mrna strand assembling the amino acids in the correct order
the mrna moves across th cytoplasmthen it gets the the cytoplasm were it reads the mrna to make a copy of itthe copy is make to trna to make amino acidthen the ribosome makes the amino acid to make protein
1 the mrna goes to a ribosome where protein synthesis will occur2 the mrna is read to produce anticodons3 trna brings the anticodons to the ribosome each codon codes for a specific amino acid4 the codons go together to form a polypeptide chainthe protein
ribosomes link proteins together to make a protein chain
1 the mrna unzips 2 the mrna changes thymine into uracil3the mrna changes its structure 4the mrna zips back up
the four major steps are dna proteins ribrosomes and lysomoes the proteins are part of the process and the ribrosomes are what helps it too leave the nucleus the lysomoes are what helps to keep it in the nucleus
mrna gives it to rna  rna makes the proteins
after mrna leaves the nucleus it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome the ribosome attaches and reads until it sees the codon aug once it sees this codon it starts pairing the bases with complementary anticodons on the trna the trna brings amino acids that link together to form a protein this process terminates at a stop codon
it starts with mrna then goes to trna then grna and finally rrna
four major steps that are involved with protein sythesis are prophase metaphaseinterphaseand annaphase
mrna trna rrna
theres mrna which is messenger rna then theres trna which is transfer rna these work to send dna and such in different places theres also rrna which is recieve rna they recieve and take care of whats sent by mrna and trna
as the mrna goes out from the nucleus and tells the trna what amino acid to get trna goes to find amino acids that will match the rna sequence then the trna gets the amino acids and finds the matching codon  on the rna sequence strand adn pairs with itthis creats an amino acid sequence that tells the cell how to make a protien
it moves to other side they all connect the help the body it moves everything
the mrna transports messages to the brain the dna strand recieves the message
the mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes to the dna and transmitts a message and then it will read it and do what it tell it to do
trna rna
prophase anapase metaphase and telophase are the four
the mrna carries instructions for the amino acid sequence for the proteins
g1proteins head to where they have to gointerphaseproteins reach destinationg2proteins seek out problemg3proteins work and fix the problem
mrna is the meesanger rna it carries the information out of the cell to the ribosome which then takes that information to the protien then once it gets to the protien the protiens starts to go through protien synthesis
carries from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence
trna trasnslats the thing it to what it is
you build up protien  your body is healthy  you lose wieght  and you feel good 
metaphseprophaseanaphasetelephase
after it leaves the mrna then it starts duplicating and making more and more proteins
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus to begin protein synthesis2 the mrna then is transferred using trna3 the mrna is attached4 the mrna is coded for a protein
the first step in protein synthesis is mrna leaving the nucleusthe second step in protein synthesis is it going into the blood streamthe third step in protein synthesis is the mrna transfering into dna the last step of potein synthesis is it leaving the body
during mrna it leaves the nucleus and goes into the blood stream once it is in the blood stream it goes through and goes to the mitochondria where the sister cells replicate after they replicate one set of the genetic information goes back into the blood stream then it goes to the brain this action is completed in just seconds
anaphase metaphase prophase and telophase
the mrna tells some other rna to make some protein  so that rna goes somewhere else  then at that place it makes some protein  the protein leaves when it is made
trna carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence of the protein
it gives the other organelles foodit helps protect the bodyit will defend anything and traps anything and turn it into food and energy
replicationtranscriptiontranslationdna

endoderm ectoderm active transport and passive tramsport are the 4 steps that are involved in protein synthesis
protein helps strengthen your bodyit protects your bodyproteins are stable
the messenger sends protiens
the mrna tells the body a protein a attches to a chromosome and gets around
there is prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase those are four major steps
the mrna starts by making a copy of itself then is sends if to the trna where it is transported throughout the body then the rrna remembers the sequence and sends it to the dna
fights infections meiosis mitoses
the mrna must first leave the nucleusthen it must travel to the rough endoplasmic reticulumwhich contains protienthen the mrna latches on to the endoplasmic reticulum and drops the m part of the mrnathen the rna is transfered into protien
mrna goes to the dna and then travels to the ribose

trnagrna
1the mrna leaves the dna to go the ribosome to deliever the strand because dna is not small enough to fit 2mrna is the messanger3mrna gives the strand to trna to transport4the strand is deleivered
the mrna travels out of the nucleus with genetic information needed to sythesize protien next trna bonds to the mrna strand with the anticodons that match up to the mrna when the trna attaches it creates the amino acids that form a protein strand
prophase this is the third phaseantiphase this is the first phaseinterphase this is the second phasemetaphase this is the fourth phase
trna transfers cells mrna messangerrrnagrna
the mrna goes into the ribosome then protiens start to form trna brings in the protiens finally the protiens all join together and form a amino acid chain
dnai dont know what else 
translation and rna processing are the first two steps then ribosomal amino acid sequencing and then translating amino acids into protiens
the mrna is read by rna polymerase trna anticodons match up with the codons on the mrna strand there is a bond between the mrna and the trna and the trna break off to form a sequence of amino acids
rna mrnatrnaamino acid
the protein is what most of the mrna is 
messenger rna is transcribed during transcription then it is coded to the transfer rna then it is made into proteins then the process starts again
the steps are propshase telopshase metophase and anaphase
it leaves the rna strand and then moves to the cell i really dont remember
mrna leaves the nucleus then trna  replaces he mrna and then that travels around and is involved in a process known as protein synthesis
1 the mrna carries the information to the nucleus
the rna will break off and attach a new strand onto the trna
1 mrna leaves nucleus2 mrna goes through the et to make proteins 3 codons are made according to the codons on the mrna4 goes to the golgi apparatus
the major step involved in protein synthesis are that the proteins cycle through the body and give it all of the protein and nutrients that it needs
starting with mrna leaving the nucleus one step involved in protein synthesis would be speclization
protein leaves the nuclues it gets synthesized it goes back to nucleus the nucleus responds and uses it
enzyme
golgi apparus which store and packages proteins
when translation begins the mrna goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon it then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code the anticodons are added by the trna the trna attaches to the p site first then moves to the a site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain then this process continues until a stop codon is reached the result is the newly created protein
anaphase prophase metaphase telophase
the mrna leaves the nucleus then the dna produces trna then the trna makes proteins and the trna transports the proteins
mrnatrnarrnarna
1 the mrna goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome 2 the mrna has the code and the trna gets this code and finds the amino acid that matches this code 3 the rrna acts as a holding device while this is going on 4 the trna brings back the amino acid to the ribosome where the protein is made because amino acids are the monomer of proteins
1 the mrna makes new protein 2 it starts the process of making a new protein strand3 it finds which protein it needs for the strand4 a new protein is formed
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to into the endoplasmic reticulum  it travels through the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus  there the golgi apparatus decides where the mrna should go and then sends it to the ribosomes  when the mrna arrives at the nucleus it is made into a protein
1trna takes the stuff from the nucleus to where it needs to go234
1new proteins are made2the protein is sent throughout the cell3protein is sent out of the cell4cycle starts all over again
the mrna goes to a ribosome then trna come and attach themselves to the mrna the dna is replicated then they unzip and there are two dna strands
mrna leaves the nucleus with amino acid sequence to the ribosomes from there the information is taken by trna to the mitochondrion where a new protein is formed
mrna has to get settled in somewhere and be able to function then it gets more sugars to multiply the strands mrna then has to go through mitosis and last it creates proteins
it carries instructions from the nucleus containing information about the sequence of amino acids of a protein
it conects to the dna and makes mrna the mrna than takes messages to other parts of the cell it goes through the nucleus through the cell membrane and than off to the other parts of the cell
protien synthesis has four major steps mrna moves the protein trna allows for the protein th tanscribe rrna creates the dna in the rna grna moves it into the cell
the first step for mrna leaving the nucleus is that it heads to a protein it goes to a protein so it can attach itself the second step is the mrna puts in information from the nuclues this helps so that the proteins can get messages to do things so that it can do what the nucleus needs it to do then the protein will start to create new proteins so that the cell can survive this will help so that the cell will be healthy and can do more tasks the final step is the mrna leaves the protein and goes back to the nucleus so that the mrna can go to another cell this process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell and then it can create more energy this also carries amino acid sequences to the proteins so they can produce or use them for energy
the protein begins to synthesizeit makes new onesit makes some kind of foodi have no clue
1 the mrna leavcs the nucleus2 it goes to the trna and reproduces3 from the reproduction there are more cells now4 the cells attaches on to another strand and starts the cycle again
after leaving the nucleus the mrna goes to the trna and is decoded and an amino acid is made from each codon then the amino acids connect to make a protein stand
the mrna
it envolves alot
once mrna leaves the nucleus rna transcription occurs  then rna translation occurs  after this dna can be made so dna replication occurs  then proteins combine with nucleic acids to make dna sequences for the new dna
the synthesis will start to pull apart then it will split into two it will then pull apart than start all over again
mrna leave the nucleusit comes back with a specific amino acidthen it pairs up with a trna in the nucleusmore mrna pair up with other trna the amino acid are joined together by a peptide bondthe trna discinnectsthe amino acids leave the nucleus to do its job

it is the mrna and it is the huge major steps and they need to go and have a lot of the synthesis
it leaves and goes to the ribisonoes making protine for the body to use
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it connects with proteins and then it coneects with high energy and it goes around the cell after that it connects with amino acids
first the mrna takes the genetic code to the trna  then the mrna attaches itself to the trna  next the mrna inscribes the code into the trna  finally the mrna releases itself and goes back to recieve more of the code
mrnarrna ribosome grnagenetrnatransfer
it just multiplies and then that means there is more and new dna
1the mrna gets other amino acides to combine with the rna234
it comes in contact with another nucleus
the mrna leaves the nucleus and it transferred to the ribosomeafter the mrna arrives copies begin being made in the ribosomeafter the copies are made they are sent out of the ribosomes and can be used for just about anythingbut they can also be transferred back to the nucleus to be used for reproduction
mrna goes and delivers the message of dna the dna is then decoded the decoded dna is then split the split dna is then put together with another strand of dna
mrna and protein syntheses are the main part
the mrna transforms they show up evolve with othersthe mrna idk
mrna transfers the sequences of amino acids to trna  from trna it is translated back to dna for a new protein to be created  at this point the daughter dna sequence is sent to the golgi apparatus where it is packaged and sent out to perform its assigned function
mrna leaves the nucleus for the ameno acids then it transfers to trna and is transformed to protein

it goes to all the other rna
the mrna is also known as the messenger rna it takes the message of the old codon sequence and copys it down into the new sequence and sends it as a message to the trna also known as the transfer rna the trna transfers the new code to the right sequence then the rrna also known as the receiving rna receives the new sequence and puts it into use so that it will do its job
translationtranscriptionreplication
protien synthesis begins with the cytoplasm going toward the ribosome
mrna is when the cell goes to the ribosomes and tells them that they need proteinsthen trnatransfer rna transfers the proteins to the spot that the area is low on proteinsthen rrna helps the proteins get therethen grna helps the cycle be repeated again

guaninethyminecitosoneadnine
mrna takes it to trna which then takes it to the the rrna that reads it and decodes it to get the message
the messanger rna takes the message from the dna and takes it to the nuclues and connects to make chromosomes
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribosomes to leave the cell once the ribosomes leave the cell through the cell membrane that is dissappearing it goes and attaches itself to the codon strand once at the strand it copies the data that will then be sent to get the anticodon strand to match up and make a protein
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it will turn into trna this trna will then continue towards the mitochondria after it reaches the protein the message from the rna will tell the mitochondria how and what kind of protein is needed then this will form a link of amino acids to form the protein needed
beginning with mrna then becoming trnathen codingfinally the cell knows what to code for the proteins
after mrna leaves the nucleus trna transfers the proteins to the er after this rrna takes it from the ribosome and then the protein is sent it off into the cell
mrna leaves the nucleus wth the instruction to bulid a protien
mrna goes to the ribosome to get attached to an amino acid
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna finds the ribosome3 the amino acids that mach the genitic sequences on the mrna come down and attach themselves to eachother4the amino acids form a protein after all of them have been attached
the mrna goes to the mitochondrion and tells the transfer rna what to do the trna then goes and gets what is needed and brings it to the cell the rrna finishes off the rna sequence with the missing pieces that the trna brought
the four major steps involed in protein synthesis are carbohydrates amino acids fat sugar

anaphaseintrphasemetaphaseand prophase are the four steps needed to for the synthesis
when mrna leaves the nucleus trna transfers information to the nucleus and translation occurs the amino acids are then read and are distributed transcription splits the amino acids and rrna makes the new protein
mrna leaves the nucleus
the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosomes and turns into trna and that goes and makes a polypeptide chain which is also known as an amino acid and the amino acids put together make proteins

the mrna unzips and the base pairs are switched t then turns to a g turns to c c turns to g and a turns to u
trna is created rrna is created then trna and rrna bring the new info to the protein and the mrna comes back
first the mrna leaves the nucleus  then the codons attach themselves to the mrna strand creating a copy of the original mrna strand  after that the amino acids are created from the codons  the amino acids then come together in long strands to become protiens
the mrna takes the information to a ribosome and then that is when trna comes into play trna takes that infromation inside of the nucleus and attaches itselfs and sends it off to the chromosomes which is the dna
two of the major steps involved in protein synthesis are transcription and translation transcription is when the dna zips open and then the mrna connects to it after the mrna connects to the dna the mrna leaves the cell and goes to the endoplasmic riticulum where the ribosomes are there is meets up with the trna this process is called translation
1 mrna leaves the nucleus 2 it gets changed in rna 3 rna is coded into an amino acid sequence and converts to dna 4 protein synthesis
1 the mrna is sent to the trna to make the amino acids2 the data on the mrna is transfered to trna3 the trna is then sent to the rrna to make the rna     sequence4 the amino acids are then connected to one another by peptide     bonds
1 when the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels down the endoplasmic reticulum to go and get transformed into trna2 when it is changed into trna the cell can make different amino acids to make more proteins3 after the cell makes more amino acids the proteins can make different things 4 the cells then change and can form and be appart from different things
mrna leaves the nucleausthe mrna goes and tries to find a new amino acidthey carry the amino acid to the rna strandthen it creates a a starnd of different rnss
they send the message through the body then they start telling the rna what to do next they keep transfering the mrna through the body and last they transfer the trna
the mrna leaves the nucleus through a small hole only sizable for it it then goes to the ribosome once its in the trna begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three the strand leaves the ribosome in pairs of three the amino acid sequence to make the protiens we need
1  the dna unzips and is copied to create mrna which can then leave the nucleus because it is single stranded2 after leaving the nucleus the mrna travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome3 the ribosome then attaches trna to the corresponding nucleotide sequences the trna has amino acids attached to the end of it4 after a second trna is attached the aminoacids form a phosphate bond with eachother and the first trna is ejected to recieve another amino acids this step repeats until the protein is complete the stop codon is reached and a the last amino acid breaks from the last trna
whem rna becomes mrna it sends out messages to other rnas and then the mrna attatches to a ribison to become rran and the n when the rrna matches up with rrna it transfers into an tran to exchange its geneitc information
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to the gose to the ribosome there the strand is pulled apart and then connected by hydrogen bonds to another strand of mrna the leftover strand gets sent to the mitocondria where is is broke down next the new strand of mrna is sent back to the nucleus
the nucleus makes a strand of rnathe rna goes to the ribosomes to tell it to make protienthe message in the rna is seen by the ribosomesthe ribosmomes makes the protien
prophase metophase anaphase telophase
1st it leaves the nucleus 2nd it makes it way through the cell3rd the mrna is made into protein4th  the protein that ha been made is used throughout the body
mrna travels throught the cell giving differant things directions or instructions on what their job is and how to do it
the mrna goes to the ribosomes and the trna tranlates the mrnas mesage so the ribosomes can make protiens from the blueprints it get from the mrna
the protien brakes down
the first step is it reads the rnathen it transcripe it and groups codonthe third step is translate the new rna then last it is changed and the rna is ready to go
mrna tells the mitochondria to use sugars and make food enzymes along with oxygen

1it leaves the nucleus     2it begins to develop proteins   3proteins are half way developed4proteins are developed
the mrna must bond with a trna first and then get the trna anticodon to match up with the codon on mrna  this means agc will have to be pair with ucg  then after they break off the trna breaks off from the mrna and goes to the ribsomes for them to make the proteins from the animo acids basically it is transcription translocation and then transferring the proteins to the ribsomes to make the protein to make the protein the ribsomes must match them in that certain order which with a new rna molecule rrna and recieve the information from the trna and make the protein with chemicals
the protein helps your body build and stay strong
mrna sends a message to the mitochondrion it takes the protein to the trna the trna delivers the protein the protein is imlemented in the cell cycle
mrna leaves the nucleus with the dna information because dna cant leave the nucleus once the mrna has taken the information to its destination trna then takes place to bring the correct amino acids in respect to the letters from the mrna after this is done proteins are made
protein reproductionprotein function
mrna messenger rna sends messages of directions to the nucleustrna transfer rna transfers certain things in and out of the nucleusrrna ribosomal rna located mostly in ribosomes
the mrna gives its information to the next rna rrna which then will pass the information to trna while with trna the rna will transcribe the rna and break it down and anylze it it will then pass it to the grna which is the last step in protein synthesis
mrna collects the information from the dna and leaves the nucleous
1 the mrna comes back to the ribosome2 trna then finds the correct amino acid for that certain codon3 the trna continues to find the amino acid for all of the codons until the mrna sequence is complete4 peptide bonds attach betweent the amino acids and form a protein
the oxygen moves through the cell to the nucleus the oxygen is then mixed with atp and sent to the er then the atp is turned into adp to then make more atp protein is then made and reproduced
1mrna is the first step involved in protein synthesis mrna id formed and later leaves the nucleus 2trna transfers amino acids to diffrent parts of the ceell 3the amino acids are linked togethercreating a protein 4 finally all of the proteins are combined to make one chain of protien  ending protien synathesis
ummmrna leaves the nucluesdna returns to nucleusribosomes appearthey make the proteins
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are messaging rna ribosomal rna transfering rna and protein productionmrna attaches to a section of a chromosome and then it copies the amino acid code that makes up the chromosome next the mrna messages the rrna to copy this section of the chromosome into an anticodon which is an exact reflection of the original code the rrna has the trna transfer this code into a set code for a new protein finally protein production occurs where the protein is synthesized to match the original code for the dna
 mrna goes outside the nucleus trna takes over trna transfers the message to the cell the cell recieves the message
strands of cells cell regenaration cell chromasomes the food supplies
then you go to prna then you go to orna then you enter trna then grna then you stop
th protein starts in your cells then entering your bloodstream
mrna goes through the golgi apparadus then through the endoplasmic reticulum then into out the cell membrane
first it has to have proteinssecond it has to have sunlight or some king of lightingthird it has to transports information from one part to anotherlast it has to come back and get more information to transport back
mrna goes out the cell goes and bonds to an amino acids form strings of proteins that are held together by peptide bonds
it use prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase in prophase the chromosomes begin to develop chromatids they are then attatched to the centromere the next stage is metaphase the nucleus begins to dissapear the chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center the next stage is anaphase where the centromere splits and each centromere goes to a pole in telophase the cell then slpits in half to form two cells
the mrna travels to the ribosomes there the ribosomes will transcribe the mrna into amino acids the amino acids than go back to the nucleus and the proccess starts over again with the nucleus decidding what amino acids it needs
the four major steps the happen after the mrna leaves the nucleus is decoded processed moved to another organell then prepared for protein synthesis
prophasemetaphaseanaphasetelophase
the dna has the code and gives it to the mrnathe trna gets the code and decodes it the code is decoded by the trnathe message is carried out to the chromosomes
to the ribosomescodeons
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
four major steps in protein synthesis are1 the unzipping of the proteins2 copying of the proteins3
protecting them
preparedsynthesizingsythensizedenergy usage
mrna leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm from there it attaches to a ribosome then it finds the correct trna molecule to attach to and it bonds to this trna molecule by a peptide bond
blood flows and thats all i know
the mrna travels to a ribosomeenters ribosome amino acids make protienmrna is broken down
mrna leaves the nucleus the amino acids form a protein trna transfers the poteins from the amino acids and i do not know any thing els
living in the envorment to survle the envorment to have a nuff to eat
the mrna goes to the  ribosomes to make trna stands  this is then taken to make protiens
1 the mrna bind to the trna2 the anticodons attach to the codons3 a polypeptide chain is formed4 proteins are made
the mrna finds an rrna and the mrna unzipps the rrna it then attaches itself to the rrna and swaps protiens the mrna then leaves and the rrna rezipps itself
enzymesproteinamino acids
four major steps in protein synthesis are to transfer the protein separate the protein put it in strands and become useful
first the protein makes a copy of its self which is rnasecond the protein travels to the ribosome which is trnathird the ribosome reads the mrna and breaks it down into smaller three part pieces called codons the mrna is broken down by peptide bondslastly the codons the smaller parts are read and are formed into the protein and the protein is formed
mrna it sends the message to the cells stating the problemrrnareplicates the cellstrnatransfers the messagegrnagets all of them together
after mrna leaves the nucleus it is moved to an amino acid that corresponds with the codon it then becomes trna and each amino acids pair together to make a polypeptide the poly peptide begins to coil and twist together as its coiling it is making a choromosome to create dna
mrna leaves the nucleustravels to the ribosomedrops off directions ribosome does its job with directions to make protein
translation transcription replication
transcription translation
sending messages to the whole cell transfuring translating and making proteins with the ribosomes
the cells getting rna to make itthe building proteinthe copying of the blueprints out of the dna to make portein
the mrna leaves the nucleus
mrna is messenger rna
1copies the mrna first2then transfers it3it then codes again4and repeats the process
trna mitosisrrnaand meiosis
1 the mrna reaches the trna2 trna gives the dna intructions3 dna uses the intructions to build genteic code4 protiens and enzymes are made
mitocondria regulates the making of protiensthe endoplasmic reticulum makes the protienthe golgie bodys pack it up and the cell uses it
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the encoded dna to the ribosome in the cytoplasm after it leaves the cytoplasm it makes new protines and then new mrna is made
1takes instruction to the nucleus2the nucleus replicates the dna3the dna is looked over to see if there are any mutations4the replicated dna starts its job
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the directions it got from the nucleas to the ribosomes then enzymes unzip the dna so it can be copied then the dna that was made is trasfered by trna and he transferes it to rna so that rrna can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the protiens
mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes to a strand of dna and attaches to it it turns the amino acids in proteins then the cell stores the proteins and uses them
protein synthesis give the body protein so it can maintain at tip top shapewithout this are body could not survive
the code has to change
it takes it to whatever place it goes then takes it to all of the other rnas
mrna goes to the cytoplasmthere it makes copies of itselftrna is maderna is connected to a strand of dna
when mrna leaves the nucleus after transcription it then attaches to a trna enayme that has the anticodon of the rna strand that ataches itself and performs translation into a readable source of rna  for the rest of the cell while in translation it has multiple enzymes with the amino acid linked to the anitcodon and are connected to the other proteins with peptides forming the peptyde chain of protiens this is protein synthesis
anaphaseprophase telophase metaphase
1 trna tranfers it outside the nucleus to be matched with a ribosome2 the ribosome latches on to an amino acid3 the codons match up4 it creates protein
well in order to have that you 1 have to have alote of strength and u 2 have to have alote of nutrition in your body in order for all of that synthesys stuff to work because if you dont have any of that it wont work
mrna will leave the nucleus with the information it recieved  it will then go to the trna to show the amino acids  the mrna will then have codons to show which amino acids are needed and when to stop
mitosis meiosis codon and chromosomal mutation
1 when mrna leaves the nucleus it then goes to the transfer rna to take the instructions for the  amino acids in the cell2 after transfer rna enters the cell it gives the cell the needed amino acids3 the amino acids are then synthesised4 the cell then uses the amino acids for different uses
mrna leaves the nucleusrna enters the nucleusproteins are broght back into the nucleusmrna reenters the nucleus
mrna  leaves the nucleus  and  goes to trna  and the trna  is tranfered to protein stynthesis were it will evolve and the process will start over again
1 the mrna arrives in the nucleus and goes through a ribosome 2 in the ribosome the mrna attracts a trna with the anticodon that matches its codon3 the trna brings the amino acid that matches the codon to the ribosome and attaches it to the other amino acids in the sequence 4 once the last codon is matched with its amino acid the trna work to form a polypeptide chain that will become a certain protein in the body based on its shape
1 mrna travels to a ribosome2rrna reads the sequence of bases on the mrna3trna brings the amino acid to the codon4 protien leaves th ribosome
1mrna gives codes to trna2trna carries codes to the amino acids3codes are followed4protein synthesis occurs
mrna leaves the nucleus to the ribosome where it makes copies of itself to distribute throughout the body
mrna turns into sperm finding the uterus thus making more of its own kind but by sharing letters with the mate like mrna mates with std it become rstds
it takes it into the cytoplasm wher the trna comes and joins to gether with it for a little whils then the trna leaves the trna matches up with the matches to the mrna and when they get together they make the protien that the body needs
after mrna leaves the cell it moved and put together by trna then it becomes rrna and finally it turns into rna
feeding absorbin the minerals getting the nutrients and passing them throughout the body
mrna leaves the nucleus
the four major steps in protein synthesis are 1the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to where the protein synthesis is to be a code for protein2 the proteins become synthesized by going through the code and recieve their code for an amino acid3 the dna is being divided into seperate strands of dna4 each strand of dna is coded and alike
1 the mrna then goes into the ribosome to be transcripted 2 other pieces of  rrna are attached to the ribosome3 a specific enzyme is attached and starts to pair up the mrna with other rna to create a protein strip 4 when this process is done proteins have been formed and are ready to perform their jobs
four major steps involved in protien synthesis is
umm first it gos through the one thing then through the other thing then back through the one thing agian then finalllyit arrives in your body where it is needed
the mrna finds a ribosome enters it connects with a anticodon to make the amino acids form a chain of amino acids
trna will transfer it out
the first step is to sherach the place where they want to benumber 2 they break in to the pieac number 3  finds where they whant to fightnumber 4 they could die
the mrna takes the dna to the trna to be made into two new strands of dna which are made by two polymerease that go up and down the dna molecule producing new segments of ionic bonds to the original ionic bonds then they are taken to the rrna to become chromosomes
interphase  metaphase prophase anaphase
1 is the interphase 2 is prophase 3 is metaphase 4 anophase
first the mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes bettween a ribosome then it transcribes into rrna to create polypeptides amino acids that will serve out there duty  to what they were made for
rna travels through the endoplasmic reticulum and to a ribosome where codons translate the sequence of rna say taga to uaga
1anaphase2 telephase3 metaphase4 prophase
prophase interphase metaphase and anaphase
one is find a pari when spilt
translationtranscription
it goes across the cytoplasm meets the trna and teams up with them which has the anticodons
1 they attach to the dna strand2 dont know3 dont know4 dont know
it brings the protien back into the nucleusit helps the cell rebuildprotiens are distributed throught the cellproteins make body healther
eating healthy
it goes to the mitochondria and then it follows the endoplasmic reticullum it stops at the golgi apparatus where it is packaged and then it is sent out in a vessicle to other parts of the cell
ribosomoes and mitochordia both create proteins
it has to make it to the mitochondria then is goes to the membrane
mrna leaves the nucleus trna transports the amino acidsrrns creates the proteins
the mrna goes off to the rrna stage to deliever the message of what the rrna needs to code exactly the rrna then codes what the mrna said to code which of course then goes to the trna the trna then brings the rna strand to fuse with another rna strand thus the two strands become a dna strand
first the mrna leaves the nucleus then the mrna travels and attaches itself to a ribosome the mrna then finds a codon that matches up with its correct codons when they meet they will form one section of dna the mrna continue this process until the full strand of dna is complete once complete the mrna will come to a stop codon meaning that the process of protein synthesis is complete
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 copy of the mrna is made3 chain the copies together4 goes to another nucleus
in protein synthesis messenger rna leaves the nucleus and attaches onto a ribosome transfer rna gets the information from the messenger rna for the amino acid sequence transfer rna transfers the information to the ribosomal rna codons then start to attch to the mrna and form an amino acid sequence
the mrna would then be transcribed by the trna during the process of replication  this would then make the ribose rna which is sent the the golgi apparatus packagedm and sent out to the ribosomes in order to build that particular protein
it goes through a pore meets with transfer rna connects with a ribosome and returns to the nucleus
metaphase this splits the cellsanaphase this splits the cells into two telephase this completes the split of the cellsprophase it is the first step
the four major steps are 1 first it gives your body the nutrients and things it needs2 it cleans your body out3 the protein starts to filter every thing out4 it leaves your body
1 the mrna goes down the electron transport chain2 it gains high energy electrons3 exits the electron transport chain4 passes the electrons to other parts of the cell
first you have mrna then you have the development of the protein and next you have the life cycle of the protein then next yuo have the death of the proteien
mrna will  find another mrna then they will be moved to a protien and combined then they will be sent to their destinations
starting with mrna the sequence then would start at its duplication of dna and then transfered into rna by transcription after the fact it would then go on with transolcation by converting it into mrna by then the mrna is doing replication by making more proteins and adding to the body
1 is when it leaves it has to get use it being gone2 is they have to work to regain it back3is when they are starting to regain it they have to store it4 is when they get it stored they have to make sure there is enough for everything
it goes to the ribosome to make new copys the trna copies the mrna then send it to wherever it needs to go
when mrna leaves the nucleus it is transcripted into trna then it is translated and you get the amino acids the amino acids then have their anticodons that are opposite of the codons for the amino acids
anaphase which is where the nuclous and organelles disappear metaphase where the dna all lines up down the middle  telophase where they split into two prophase
mrna then travels through your body and the connects to your codons creating an amino acid which forms your dna sequences it then transfers into to trna and that then creates an amino acid which forms a codon which then forms our dna
1 mrna is caught by a ribosome2the anti codon is attached3the amino acid attaches and the anticodon detatches4the mrna leaves the ribosome
step one the mrna leave the cell and into the bodystep two the mrna turns into trnastep three the trna goes through the rhibosomestep four protiens are made and go back to cell
they make them and then carry them out the body so no one can get hurt and then they make more protines
mrna leaves the nucleusdna is decodedthe code is transfered to trnatrna then does protein synthesis
1 the sending of proteins to the golgi apparatus2 the transfer of information from the  nucleotides3 the transfering of the protein4 the absorbtion of the protein
it travels through the cytoplasm latches into a ribosome and then the ribosome is able to read the directions and produce the correct protiens
transcription translation
strands of dna of melocule are held together by mrna
the mrna  is semipermeale
the nucleus cytoplasmerand polypetides
replication makes a copy of the protein of the dna transcript helps send the copies translation helps the dna read the protein then the protein gets folded
the mrna leaves the nucleus then translated it is read then is is transcripted so it can be used for whatever is needed it is then a protein
first in protein synthesis the cells create prteins that regualt your tissues then it helps you build strong bones  next it regulates the genetic material inside your body finall the cells help digest the proteins inside your body
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to a ribosome in the ribosome the rrna selects the opposite genes of the mrna the trna selects the anitcodons which are the opposite of the codons on the rrna then the trna synthesizes the genes sequences into amino acids and when the amino acids form together they create a protien
the mrna strand enters a ribosome trna brings an anticodon to the ribosome that matches the codonthey form new amino acidsthey are connected and form new dna
the mrna goes to the ribosome and puts the sequence onto the trna which then transcribes the sequence onto a type of rna that has different sequences of 3 that each have a different amino acids on them which form protiens when they are all linked together from the trna sequence
mrna goes to the trna and some how gets amino acids and codons to make energy so that proteins can be made to give the body the stuff it needs
1 mrna attaches to an enzyme2 trna comes and attaches to the mrna3 trna translates the mrna into a dna sequence4 this dna sequence is then made into a protein
first messenger rna send a message to the nuclius to decode the rna the rna is translated into dna in the nuclius it is added to a dna strand in the cytoplasm that strand is sent to the nuclius again
1  mrna leaves the nucleus2  mrna splits apart3  mrna is read and coded4  proteins are created
messenger rna will leave the nucleus of a cell with a programmed code within this code is a suffient supply of proteins and other sugars that will benefit our body messenger rna makes its way out of the nucleus through pores out into the cytoplasm within the cytoplasm the mrna meets up with other organelles within our cell this mrna then creates a copy of itself this copy too holds information the information this time can provide knowledge for the nucleus on what other sugars and proteins are needed but also contains information for the ribosome on what proteins and sugars to create
eat protein
after mrna leaves the nucleus it is translated into an identical strand during translation then it becomes trna after that it starts becoming a protien during protein synthase finally it is made into a brand new protien
phototsynthis enegry coxygen carbon dioxide
mrna leaves the nucles and then embarks on four steps that help the body create the proteins capable of directing body fucntions the four major steps are dna replication or meiosisit then travels to a ribosome where the ribosome prodcues a protein called trna the trna travels to a portion of the mrna or a polypeptide bond this bond folds and is sent to the golgi body where the polypeptide bond is then sent to the rest of the cell
it helps
it carries it across the nucleas were it is paird up with dna to continue the strand
g1 is dividing dnas phase is replicating dna g2 is preparing for the m phasem phase is division of the cells
mrna leaves the nucleus then it moves to the ribosome when it gets to the ribosome mrna decodes then it becomes trna
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein trna transfurs the information and rrna carries the ribosomes
carries instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein
translocation transcription
after mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna goes and makes a copy of the dna after that trna makes the rna code of the dna the mrna takes the rna code to the dna and it attatches to make a new straind of dna
1translation goes to the trna it tells what it needs to do2rna processing3compbines these to copy the mrna brought out of the nucleus with hydrogen bonds4the rrna takes it out of the cell and places it where it is needed
1 the mrna after leaving the nucleus then travels to the trna2 when the mrna gets to the trna transcription happens and new codons are formed so as to match the mrnas sequence3 the trna then takes that sequence to dna where it is translated into the correct sequence for proteins4 the protein is made
1 cell lose2 cell respiration3 cell cycle 4 cell mutation
after leaving the nucleus the mrna meets trna the trna then codes to the codon on the mrna  the amino acid on the trna then forms to be the protein that matches the code then the amino acids form a chain
1 translation will turn into protein 2 anaphase occurs3 proteins go throughout the body4 metaphase occurs
the dna is transcribed the dna is translated the dna is copied trna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
goes to the mitocondria builds amino acids finds a strand of dna and makes energy
transfer rna
interphaseanaphase metaphasetelophase
the mrna sends a message to the trna which then the rrna will complete the process
the mrna leaves the nucleus and the cell splits in half
collect the protein get the bad out the ribosomes collect them and then they transfer throughout the body
mrna will change into trna and will leave amino acids then the amino acids will make a ribosome mrna will send a message to trna finally ribosomes will connect and make a bond
the mrna delivers the message to the mambrane then the trna transfers the rna then the rana starts to form strands of new dna ionic bonds are made between each protein
the cell membrane the cell wall and the inner core
1 transcription  the mrna strand goes to the dna strand to replicate it and convert it to mrna2 translation      a the rrna clears the way for the mrna to come back to the nucleus and the mrna does         b the mrna attaches to the ribosome      c the trna brings over the anticodon which codes for an amino acid which forms a protein
1 the mrna transports the blah blah blah
mrna meets trna and translation occurs trna is read by a ribosome and forms anticodons making a chain of amino acids until it reaches a stop codon and a protein is formed
the strand breaks apart a half of a strand is made for one part the two half strands pair up  the mrna goes back into the nucleus
after mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the information to the trna so it can transfer the information for the amino acid sequence the next step is the trna makes the amino acid sequence after that the rrna gets rid of whatever is left and the ribosomes make more the last step is the mrna leaves the cell and goes to another one to do the same steps again
four major steps are proteins breaking down with the help of enzymes
mrnagrnarrnatrna
it is then sent out to send the messga to the trna and then trna makes the copy of the 3 segement and then it is copied again an then it is used
starting with mrna leaving the nucleus protein synthesis goes from rrna to rna to dna to protein
protein synthesis is contained of a protein changing into something else that it is supposed to be the protein goes through many steps that make it a useful organism for the cell including transcription and translation
mrna goest to the trna to become transfer then it gets sent to the amino acid sequence then trna to be synthesized by the rrna then rna breaks off dna strand
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the trnathe trna then goes to the rrna to transcript the dnawhen it gets to the rrna the rrna breakdown the dna molecules and send them to the grnathe grna then make a gentic code
the mrna leaves nucleus it goes to the ribosome and is connected by trna the trna connects to 3 nucleotides to make an amino acid the trna keeps connecting to mrna to make amino acids until it reaches a stop codon the amino acids are then made into proteins for the cell

first after mrna leaves it is transferred to trna then trna transfers the information to the nucleus the nucleus then carries out the action that needed to take place inside the cell so it all starts with mrna in order to get information to the nucleus for the function to be carried out
name
the process starts out with the mrna leaving the nucleus the ribosomes in the cell are what makes the proteins the mrna attaches to a ribosome the trna in the cell brings the materials needed to create protein to the mrna the trna can only get one material dehydration synthesis begins to join the parts together making a protein
the mrna replicates the strand of dna making an exact copy of it then it leaves the nucleus and is cut into sections of three then they are read these deciphered mrna are then changed into amino acids the amino acids make proteins
1 the translation process starts which decodes the mrna message2 then the trna tranfers that decoded message of the amino acid sequence3next the amino acid sequence goes through transcription4the protein is assembled on a ribosome
1 the mrna created in the nucleus leaves the nuclear membrane and goes into the cytoplasm 2 the mrna is found by a ribosome the two then lock in with one another 3 trna brings anticodons to the ribosome the organelle will read the anticodon and match it with the proper codon on the mrna this matchup causes a certain amino acid to form 4 as this proces continues through the entire length of the mrna a polypeptide is created
anaphaseinterphasetelephaseprophase
mrna tranfer new codonmrna
mrna leaves the cell it goes to were it is told it does its workthen it returns the were it came from
starts of with the cell has to have an unwanted thing or damaged organelle inside of itthen it has to have the lysosome come and eat these patricalsthen it starts to synthesis itwhen its done it gives off the energy to the rest of the cell
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosomes it is a single strand so trna comes with its codons that attach to the mrna in specific ways it first has to find aug to start the rrna then attaches to the mrna and creates the site to where the codons can attach to the mrna and create proteins as it creates the proteins the proteins are linked to form a polypeptide chain the polypeptide breaks loose when it reaches a stop codon
mrna goes and gives the coded message to trna and trna then decodes the message goes and finds a protein and gives the protein the message and the protein is then made
carries instructions from the nucleus from the animo acid sequence of a protienim not sure about the other ones
when mrna leaves nucleus carries instructions for the dna to begin protein sythesis
the proteins duplicatethe proteins move to the new cellthe proteins respond in the new cellthe proteins make new proteins
first mrna goes through transcription translation and something else i dont remember
dna codeing dna is decoed by the ribosome to make mrnatranscription once the dna is coded into mrna the process of transcription follows in which the mrna is recoded into trnaanticodonstraslation now the trna is then coded by the ribosome once again and is now ready for protien systhesisprotein systhesis following up on translation the trna has now been coded and the new protein has been produced
mrna then turn into a ridosome from their it gets the rest of the process happens with natural selection
first the mrna binds with the trna second the pairs of rna that binded bind with the amino acids third they form a polypeptide lastly the chain breaks lose
the mrna takes insturctions to the amino acid and then it the trnatakes over there and it transfers the amino acid and the the whole squence starts again
1 prophase2 metaphase3 anaphase4 telophase
the mrna binds to the ribosome and makes trna which then goes and gathers amino acids then the trna drops the amino acids off then goes and gets more until a stop condon is read then polypeptide bonds for making the protein then the protein leaves the cell
messenger it leavestranscription deodes rna translation translates rnaribosomal puts rna into the correct ribosome
mrna goes to the ribosome were the ribosome creates trna and take it to a cell to be copied and translated into dna
as mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to rrna or a ribosome to be translated into a protein  trna travels to the ribosome with an amino acid it then creates a covalent bond and releases the amino acid  as more and more of these covalent bond occur more amino acids begin to fuse together creating a polypeptide bond  the polypeptide then folds up and travels to the golgi to be sent to where it is needed
1 it travels through the cytoplasm2 it reaches the trna3 trna codes for amino acids4 the amino acids are sent
1 the mrna goes into a ribosome2 the rrna translates the code in the ribosome3 the trna connects to amino acids cg at4 when the trna reaches a stop codon a protein is released
mrna leaves the nucleus and gives the amino acid sequence for the protein the protein is made and used in a section of dna
the mrna will go to a ribosomethe ribosome will make an opposite copy of the strand so it can fit together an have to similar rna strandsthe mrna will go back to the nucleus to fit into the dnathe rna may have a mutation or the dna strand will be complete
it just leaves
1 your body will push the proteins into your organs2 the proteins come from the organs and get moved into your digestive system
1 it goes to the amino acids to decode the message2 gives the message to trna to tranfers it to the ribosome3 the ribosome then understand the message and start making protein4 protien is made
1 leaves nucleus2 amino acids with protein synthases hook onto mrna3 transfer mrna information to amino acids that are attached to proteins4 release the amino acid and protein which become separated
copy the dna
anaohasemetaphasetelophasecytokanises
first the segement on mrna are put the gether by the nucleus next the mrna leaves the nucleus and pairs up with the floating bases around them the bases line up with the mrna and form codes each sequence of three bases is a protein
the protein builds itself then it builds mocleudes then the cell walls come in that makes the cell
the first step is when the mrna attaches to the ribosomes which are produced by rrna the mrna forms a codon then trna anticodons bring amino acids to match the codons the amino acids attach by peptide bonds after releasing the amino acid the trna leaves to get more amino acids the process stops when a complete protein is made
after mrna leaves the nucleus it transscribes itself to make set of trna
after mrna leaves transcription takes place in wich the meassage from the mrna is made into codons that code for amino acids  next translation occurs and the codons are translated  into anticodons  next the amino acids are brought in to create a protein
the nucleus will die out because it will not have no mrna to help it surviveit will be able to creat a new generation so that it can live onit will struggle to liveit will not be able to collect food with out it
mrna divides     trna is formed     trna carries information to nucleus     nucleus sends out the messages
the mrna leaves the nucleus to go to a ribosome with the copied dna nucleotides connect in the correct order amino acids attatch the amino acid chain keeps getting longer and after each amino acid attaaches to the chain it unattaches itself from the nitrogen bases
then it travels to a place where it makes a copy of it and makes the protein that your body needs to servive
1 the mrna will leave the nucleus2 the dna will start stacking up3 three dna will join together4 the amino acid will form
keep organisms in the right areas make sure organisms are projected maintain all the organisms in your body and have your organisms healthy
the rna will leave and go through a lil tunnel and go to the and the break off into 2 pieace and then combine to make one later on into dna
goes through ribosomes
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribosomes to start the processe of transrelation from the code the dna strand had to the code the ribosomes can use to make the proteins and oucne the new protein get th estop codon the ribosome releases the new protein
it has to find a nitrogenous base match with a certain strand of dna because only certain bases fit with the other bases then they have to align themselves up to the right base of each base next they slowly attatch to each other one at a time finally they all come together and it is all done

reproduction meiosis transporting leaving
interphase prophase metaphase anaphase
interphase prophase telephase and anaphase
the mrna goes to a deoxyribose protein that attaches to the mrna and transcribes it next trna bring the correct amino acids to create the protein the ridosome then puts the amino acids in place a new protein is created
prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
the mrna takes the protien the trna then the trna attach the protien to the rna and the amino acids are attach the the mrna
nucleus splits spread apartforms a new cell
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are how they are produced when they are produced why they are produced and what you can do to prevent them from being used
leavinfg nuclios celluler transportation and cell division
the go through the nucleus then leave help the body during the way fix what ever needs to be fixed then go out through the nucleus and goes to other parts of the body
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna strand is decoded and turned into a second code3 that code is then decoded and turned into protein
the protein gets packaged up into little groupsthe protein is sent to another part of the cell
1 the cell makes messenger rna2 the mrna changes to trna3 the cell sends the trna out of the cell into the cytoplasm4 the trna goes into the ribosomes where protein will be created
first the proteins are removed and the ribosomes do something to them
1 the proetin starts to develop 2 the proetin starts to expand 3 the proetin is starting to move around in the cell  4 the protein is starting to go through interphase and reproduce
1finds amino acids 2hooks on 3forms peptide bond with previous mrna that is already on the amino acid4previous mrna peels off leaving the newer one there5a third mrna comes hooks on forms peptide bond and the initial one leaves to go retrieve more proteinbuilding instructions
trna srna grna and rrna
the mrna leaves the nucleus and then duplicated and seperated
mrna carries the instructions from the nucleus and gives to it to the amino acid sequence for proteins
mrna gives instructions on which how to make the dna trna transfers the strands to build the dna then the rrna hooks up the codons to build the dna
mrna sends the information of the proteintrna transfers the partsrna builds the protein with amino acidsa protein is made
prophase anaphase interphase metaphase
first mrna leaves the nucleus then trna apears and creates covalent bonds for the mrna
mrna leavs nucleus mrna go to ribosomes
first the proteins open up then the substance prepares to leave te cell next the substance leaves the cell finally the proteins close back up
it moves through the body
translation
the first step to protein synthesis is mrna leaves the cell the second step is it gets more protein the third step is it brings the protein back for the cell the last step on protein mrna is it puts the protein back into the cell for it to function
when mrna is leaving the nucleus it is involved in four major steps 1prophase2interphase3metaphase and 4anaphase these are the four major steps involved in protien synthesis
metaphase antanphase tellaphase and interphase
the first step is getting the protien the second step is taking it in the third step is getting it processed the fourth is using it because you need to use protien for the body and it helps the body also when mrna leave the nuclues
rna multipliesmeaning that there are twice as much rna for the cell the mrna goes back into the nucleus the mrna returns with more rna the protein synthesis is made by the mitochandria also the proteins go back to the nucleus
mrna leaves the nucleus
mrna leaves the nucleustrna leaves the nucleusdna leaves the nucleus
decode
1 mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to where the dna is located2  mrna drops off the codons of rna3  mrna leaves and goes back to get more codons4  the process starts again
mitocondria getting the code for protein synthesis
when mrna leaves the nucleus a ribosome latches onto the mrna and takes the instructions it needs off of the mrna
dnareproduction
the mrna carries the insturctions for the protein sythesis to the golgi apparatus  there the protein is synthesized the trna then transports the protein to the ribosome the trna carries a codo which stays attached to the protein this codn help it attach to a specific enzyme
once the rna leaves the nucleus it travels to the tell the ribosomes that it is ready to make a new copy of itself so that the proteins that are needed can go to where they belomg they make the proteins and then go back into the nucleus and break down
mrnarnadna trna
the rna is replicated and codons and amino acids exchanged and changed into amino acids for dna
mrna gives the genetic information to dnathe dna copies the information through a process of replication the dna uses the codons to reveal the amino acids to make a polypeptide chain the chain moves throughout the cell and creates more proteins
translation trna reflection and dna
first off the mrna sepeates the links in the dna strand secondly the strand goes to a ribosome which makes it into rrna thirdly it is taken to something and made into trna
when mrna leaves the nucleus the next four major steps involved in protein synthesis are mrna leaves and travels to the cytoplasm and onto a chromosome after that it turns into trna when it turns into trna it turns into protein
trna rrna
the dna has to translate to mrna for example tag would become auc it then matches with nucleotides to form bonds these longs strands make sequences the sequences are instructed to make proteins
mrnatrnagrnarrna
mrnatrnarnadna
the mrna travels to the ribosome and then turns into a trna the trna does its job and eventually turns into an mrna
mrna turns into trna and then its is turned into dna which is turned into proteins
the mrna takes the rna to the animo acid sequence so it can be made the rrna helps make the new rna and then takes it to the trna the trna then transfers it back to the nucleus where it is used
the dna uncoils the rna becomes sinfle stranded the dna is transformed the dna is rezipped
they copy the dna they take it out of the nucleus they make a new strand and copy that
after mrna finishes it them goes to the trna and tells it whow to copy the dna while in the proces then comes the codons and come and take the copied dna and seperated
goes out the nucleus into the cell membrane into the ribosomes and out the cell wall
the mrna will go through anaphase and then inaphase then metaphase and finally telaphase
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes onto the ribosomes the ribosomes then take the messenger rna and transfer them the ribosomes carry the mrna to trna the transfer rna the goes into the dna sequence you go from mrna to the ribosomes to trna and then to the final product
the mrna finds a chain of codons in the nucleus to be taken out then the trna transfers this chain out of the nucleus then rrna recodes the codons into the pattern of rna and makes rna with other protiens too
the steps are transportation translation replication  nutriationm they all halp provide for the cell giving it wehat it will need and supplying for it
first the mrna would carry the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein into the cytoplasm second the trna would receive these instructions find the needed amino acids and carry them to the ribosome third the rrna would bind amino acids with the codons to the ribosome fourth the amino acids with the anticodons would be attached to the amino acids with the codons which would result in a protein
the first step is transcriptionthe second step is the third step is translationthe fourth step is 
it makes a copy strand takes the copy strand out side of the nucleus makes a copy of the amino acid and multiplies
mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna tries to find a part of the cell once the mrna finds a good part of the cell it starts making proteins for the cell
homeostasis prophase interphase nucleus
the mrna finds and attachs to a ribosome then a trna moves in and connects its segments to the mrna then once coded the trna leaves the mrna then goes to find another ribosome
rna dna
the first step in protein synthesis is mrna sends the new strands of dna to the nuclues and then the process starts over again
the messager rna starts out and send it to trna transprt rna which then sends where mrna has told it to
eubacteriaprokaryotescellseukaryotes
the mrna copy the intructions from the dna and come out of the nuclear envelope pores and travel to the ribosomes the ribosomes read the intructions and then they send it out to the body to create the amino acids they are supposed to create then they bring the amino acids back the the ribosomes where they are put together to make proteins
gives energy to the bodyhelps fight viruseshas all the information of the genes
after it leaves the mrna it goes to a peptidethere it is transcribedthen it is sent to rrna
mrna leaves the nucleas goes through the cytoplasm enters the rrna and then they make the amino acids according the the copied dna
when mrna leaves tjhe nucleus the procces begins by interphase then prophase then metaphase then anaphase
the mrna is edited and the unwanted parts of the sequence are destroyed then translation occurs the mrna sequence is sent the the ribosome where rrna is the ribosome reads the mrna by codons the trna then brings an anticodon to attatch to the mrna the chain of amino acids form a protein
step one would be mrna leaving the nucleus and entering the ribosome step two would be when the trna with a protien on top and a codon on bottom come and they attach the anticodons with the mrnas anticodons step three would be after the trna attaches to the anticodons and leaves it leaves behind an amino acid step four would be after several trnas come and go and the amino acids join together forming a polypeptide chain which later becomes a protein
the mrna delivers the message to trna then the trna changes it into proteins
interphaseprophaseanaphase telophase
once the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to a ribosome at the ribosome iniation occurs when a trna molecule with the anticodon uac binds to the codon aug coding for the amino acid met and starting the synthesis of the protein next elongation occurs as more trna molecules bind to codons and form peptide bonds in between the amino acids to build the protein when the trna comes upon a stop codon the new protein breaks off in the process of termination and goes into the cell last the ribosome completes the process by disassembly getting ready for a new mrna molecule
mrna goes and makes copies of itself then they give it to the amino acids then the amino acids get everything they need to make protein then they make protein
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis is that it sends messsages to the nucleus 
one rna carries instructions from the nucleus to proteinstwo the proteins carry it somewhere importanti dont know
1 get in the strand2 have a corce3 how to get there4 and infect there pray
it has to pass through the cell wall and go to the neucleus
goes through some rigures things to make sure the mrna makes new rna to get through the life cycle
metaphase telephase anaphase and prophase

prophase it is when the two sister chromosomes pull apart and go to different sidesmetephasethey meet in the middleanaphase they pull aparttelephase they switch over
1sort out protien2make enzymes3create energy4give protien
the mrna sends the instructions to the trna that makes copies and the rrna makes the amino acid sequence that makes a specific protien
one mrna  copies the messagetwo mrna goes to trnathree trna replicates itfour new cells are copied
mrna transcibes to a ribosome then the ribosome joins a codon and an anticodon then the ribosome joins 2 amino acids and this will keep going until it reaches a stop codon
well first it goes into mrna and then it moves into trna because it is transporting the protein to wherever it needs to go
the mrna delievers the protein to trna and the trna transfers the protein to the amino acids and the amino acids then make protein
mrna trna transports protein rrnareceives protein dna a  new dna is formed
four major steps are intrphase prophase metaphase anaphase
the mrna travels to the ribosome
1trna2rrna3grna4mrna
mrna leaves handing it to the messenger messenger hands it to the receiver the receiver hands it back to the messenger
first they find their pair next thymine replaces with uraine then they seperate to make another pair finally they pair back together as a one pair
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it enters a ribosome at the ribosome translation starts to take place  anticodons are paired with codons to make polypeptide sequences  codons consist of three of the following adenine uracil cytosine or guanine they can go in any order such as aaa uau guu cua and many many other combinations  complementary codons are like the opposite because they work in pairs adenine goes with uracil and cytosine goes with guanine floating nucleotide bases are dropped off and put into order based on these complementary pairs  then amino acids are put into order as a polypeptide sequence
the mrna leaves the nucleus into the cytoplasm next the mrna goes to the ribosome when the mrna arrives at the ribosome the codons sequence of three consecutive nitrogen bases are translated into amino acids the amino acid chain is assembled and it then leaves the ribosome
after mrna leaves the nucleus it copies and unzips
the four major steps invloved in protein synthesis are prophase anaphase metaphase and interphase
1 it is trantproted to the rrna2it is thin read and decoted3thin the trna brangs jin a code     4 then it is moved down for the next segment to be coded
proteins develop muscles and bones they prevent from disease and also proteins help digest food
if your body doesnt have a match to go with the strand that is on the other side the whole mrna will fall apart
mrnatrna
sunlight causes the chlorophyll to produce oxygen which is released into the atmosphere
the mrna attaches to a ribosome then codons attach then the codons match the sequences of the organins process repeates until a protein is made
mrna first takes the message from the nucleus to the ribosomes to start trna where they translate the message then at the polypeptides they start putting it all together into a message and then the last step is when they start to conclude the process
anaphase metaphase telophase prophase
copying of the dnadna getting transfereddna getting paired with a new stranddna being fused with new strand

mrna leaves the nucleus it moves out of the membrane into another cell giving that cell the rna
1 anticodons and codons are attached2polypeptide chains are formed3ribosomes are attached
prophasemetaphase anaphase telephase
enzymsprotonscellcell membrain
1 dna splits and a matching copy of rna is made2 the rna then starts creating proteins that coincide with the sequence it has made from the dna 3 once the amino acids have connected to the rna and proteins have been created trna takes the proteins and delivers them to the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes4 the ribosomes give the proteins their instructions or function
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase are four major processes that are involved in protein synthesis
mrna takes the rna to the with directions to copy the stand trna which will transfer the rna to the rrna which will copy the rna
after mrna leaves the nucleus it is then turned into trna the trna is then sent out of the ribosomes and is lead to the golgi body the golgi body sends it out to the cell
mrnarrnagrnatrna
first the mrna leaves the nucleus  second it attaches to a ribosome  third  trna begins bringing amino acids and using the mrna as a pattern to synthesize a protein  fourth the mrna is destroyed and the protein goes to the place it was created for
after mrna leaves the nucleus it delivers the information to the amino acid to connect the corresponding codons to the rna
the mrna breaks apart into 2 seperate strandsthen it duplicates that part of its codenext one strand from each division combines with the opposite one and is put togethersteps repeat
trnarrna mitosisarna
mrna sends out the message that the body needs more proteinthe ribosomes form the rna
when mrna leaves the nucleus it sends a message to the body that it needs more protein  the mrna makes a code  it then goes to the spot where proteins are made and carries them back to the nucleus
it is taken in and transformed by photosynthesis and made in to proteine and then used
1 the mrna is delivered to a certain protein 2 the amino acids start to build up or strand together3 the amino acids join together to create strands of rna4 then the amino acids all joined together transmit through the cell to different areas in which they are needed most
it needs to be unzipped then a machine reads its codonthe proper protiens are brought togeather to make a protien chain
mrna leaves the nucleusit then goes through the cytoplasm to the golgi apparatusthen in the golgi it makes a protien codonthen the codon is expelled from the cell
mrna gets a protein which turns it into dna
after the mrna leaves the nucleus
once mrna leaves the nucleus it is messanged instructions to th amino acidtransfer rna transfer it in sequence with codene then rna then gives the information back to the ribosome organelle which which now holds all the information
leaves mates makes something dies
the mrna will go to the ribosomesthe trna transferes the dna to rnathe rna combines with the dna
first mrna is transcribed form the nucleus using base pairing a process known as transcription then the mrna leaves the nucleus and and attaches itself to a ribosome where rrna is located next trna will bring amino acids for the coorosponding codons on the mrna these amino acids will form a polypeptide chain and eventually leave the ribosome for external use
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it     1 finds an enzyme in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum     2 the enzyme then moves along the mrna like a zipper and copies the code making it a new strand of dna     3 that dna then tells other enzymes how to make proteins     4 the cycle repeats
after mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes to trna where uracel is usedand then to the nucleus where uracel is replaced with thymine
cut introns splice the nearons cap and tail
first the rna unzips and becomes two seperate strandsafter the first strand of rna unzipsa new strand is made to combine with both of the unzipped strands
it leave the dna
1mrna is paired with a trna2the trna takes the mrna to a ribosome3the ribosome takes the mrna to the golgi apparatus4the golgi apparatus then digests and uses the mrna
prophase metaphase anaphase telophase
mrna leaves nucleusgoes to mitochondria and is stripped and changed to rrnarrna is changed to trna trna goes back to nucleus
the dna has to be read
mrna is the messanger that carries the protein to the nucleustrna transfers the protein
mrna leaves the nucleus and then travels to the cytoplasm there the cytoplasm brings in hte mrna then hte mrna goes through stuff in the cytoplasm
works with trna and many enzymes then it gets paired and is protein
1 the mrna travels to the goglgi apparatus2 the golgi apparatus then decodes the rna molecule3 there is a new dna molecule made from the rna4 the new dna then can continue to make new proteins after being decoded again
mrna leaves the nucleus giving the trna the information trna then leaves to give it to rrna then the ribosomes then create the what was within the information
when it leaves the nucleus starts making more right away
firth the mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes through the cytoplasm into the proteins after that is synthesisis with the protein and then finally it goes through protein sythesis
then the trna transfers the protien then goes to the nrna then they separate the rna
mrna leaves the nucleus trna transcribes rrna reads the messageproteins are developed
there are the four types of dna rdnatdnamdna rrna
the mrna leaves the nucleusthen trna brings amino acids to to mrnathe trna breaks off and then goes to get more amino acids forming a new protein
1 mrna leaves the nucleus                                                      2 sending a message to the rna to make a copy3 rna sends to the trna to make the copy4 sends to the other side of the dna to form a new set of strands for the dna5 placing them together to form a new doulbe helix
interphase prophase annaphase telophase
the protein copies the mrna in the ribosome the protein copies all of the mrnas information then sends the information to the mitochondira the mitochondira then analyzes the information the information is used to help the process of protein synthesis
the mrna goes out and gets the things neededit brings them back to the ribosomesthe ribosomes make proteinsthe mrna leaves the nucleus again
one mrna lieves the cell two it goes in to the body three it finds a new cell four it is used as energy in the new cell
prophase anaphase metaphase telaphase are four major groups
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels with the instructions necessary for the rrna to use amino acids and create proteins in the ribosome then when in the ribosome the rrna matches the correct amino acids to create a protein
the mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the golgi apparatice where it is duplicated then the gogi apparatice reads the strand and makes the protiens to match the sequence
transferring the mrna onto the new strand translating it attaching and copying
since the mrna leaves the nucleus it began to produce getting energy from sugar the cells inside the rna begin to seperate this is call metophase after they divide the chromosomes begin to pull apart this is all interphase afer they pull apart 2 differrent cells begin to appear this is call prophase after they finish seperating 2 new cells are shown this is call interphase
mrna sends out instructions to trna including what different amino acids are needed the trna brings the amino acids together for synthesis then rrna puts the amino acids together in the correct order and sequence the body then uses the protein to perform a specific function
transport forming of the proteins break down and forming nutrients to protein
the protien sends off synthesis to all the cells the protein synthesis gets abrorbed by the cells the protein synthesis get used in work by the cells the protein synthesis is reused by other cells after decomposed
the mrna is copied to trna and the trna is translated to amino acids and amino acids are produced
it will traval throught your bady and then it will stay there for a big munt of time
there are a lot of different ways
first mrna leaves the nucleusthen the mrna is translated to trna next trna is translocated then finally to form a protein
mrna send a message to the protiens and trna transfers them
the process in which rna makes proteins is called translation during translation the mrna leaves the nuclues and enters the ribosomes the part of the cell that creates proteins the trna pairs its anticodon with the mrnas codon to form and amino acid when another amino acid is made the two pairs form a bond to stick together holding information to create the protein once the stop codon arises and the bonds are complete the protein is assembled
mrna is changed to trnatrna is sent to endoplasmic reticulumprotein is synthesized
anaphaseinterphasemetaphase and prophase
the mrna leaves the nucleus then it reaches the dna then it switches and makes and rna last it leaves the nucles with a new deoxyribose
mrna leaves the nucleus carrying the intructions on how to make a protein next the trna takes that information to the rrna which starts the actual process of making the protein lastly grna finishes out the job by sealing the protein and sending on its merry way to its final destination in the body
it goes though the er in to a veshicle then goes to the mitcodria and links up with the cells membrane easesout the cell
the major four steps are
trna rrna grna
name
transcription
1 the rna attaches to ribosomes2 trna guides the rna to the amino acid sequence3 the rna attaches to the amino acid sequence4 information is exchanged to make protein
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the golgi bodies where transferrna gets the sequence from the messengerrna ribosomes build the proper protiens that were coded in the rna the golgi bodie then pacages and ships out the protiens to the er in the endoplasmic reticulum the protiens are assembled into the protien strand the were meant to be
1find the dna strand2collect the message3return to the nucleas4decode the message
the nucleus gains some more protonsthe nucleus gains electronsgains neutrons and gains electrons
mrna leaves the nucleus then it bonds with a strand of rna which is then copied to trna which copies itself onto a new rna strand
1 protein synthesis carries the mrna across the membrane2 from the membrane the mrna goes into both sides3 mrna starts to work its way up to the plant4 once to the top protein synthesis stops
giving the brain information for dna
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cell and then to another cell there it gives information on the dna to that cell
1it goes to the transport2from the transport it goes to the ribose3the ribose carries it back to the dna4the process starts all over again
rna leaves the nucleus a ribosome attaches to it to read it complementary pieces are added to the rna untill a protein is formed then the complementary pieces break off and you have a protein
the mrna is met by trna with anticodons that link to the mrnas codons this trna carries an amino acid that goes with the mrnas codon this is done multiple times until there is a stranhd of amino acids ribosomes attach these amino acids together
the rna hooks with another strand and they produce more rna which makes your appearence change gradually
mrnadnarnatrna
the mrna leaves the nucleus and connects to trna in the ribosome     the trna then makes an anticodon that matches the codons on the mrna     then the trna goes out and finds the amino acid that matches with the anticodon that its carrying     finally the all the trna come back and connect the amino acids in order to create the protein
mrna leaves the nucleus and forms bonds with trna to create more mrna
1 becomes mrna becomes r rna2 that becomes trna3 that becomes a new cell
take the information so it can make dna copiesget together the anticodons
1telophase2anaphase3prophase4unaphase
dna forms
takes somethign to another place
replication division developement four
mrna makes a blueprint of the rnatrna tansfers it out of the nucleus to the rrna
mrna then turns into a protein
rnamrnatrnadna
first the trna bonds with the mrna the trna then gives anticodons that match the anticodons in the mrna this makes an amino acidmore trna then comes and repeats the whole process the mrna leaves the amino acid in the ribosome this whole process is repeated until there is a stop codon then the chain of amino acids is released this chain is a protein
with mrna leaving the nucleus four major things happen with protien synthesis they are transcriptiontranspirationtransloctaion and etc
they transfer the mrna into trna
transpiration
mrna attaches to a strand of rrna in a ribosometrna codons carrying aminoacids attach to the rrna according to the rrna base sequencethe aminoacids carried by the trna link together with peptide bondsa stop codon carried by the mrna interrupts the process when the proteine is completed and allows it to leave the ribosome
the dna splits producing rna
the mrna leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosomes where rrna finds complementary bases to be paired up with the dna strand the other strand is used to make an rna strand with the trna
mitocondriachromosomes ribosomeser
the 4 major steps are mrna leaving the nucleus then gets moved over to the ribosomes then it gets put with the anticodons  and the last part the proteins get formed into a chain type resulting in protein synthesis
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it then shifts into trna which transports proteins across the cell after the proteins had been transported the process of rna is shown and it starts to build a rna molecule after the rna molecule is formed it then forms one side of a dna molecule then a dna molecule is formed
mrna gets and amino acid from there the amino acid goes to trna and then is attached to nucleotides which froms a protein
gives a message to organisms sends for ribosomes goes back to nucleus and gets more messages
things in your body that give more oxygen each time
its almost like dna but its not because its procerds protein mrna and mdna his the saming meaning but it diffenernt because dna is well blood  and mrna is protein
the amino acids the dna and the rna
moves through the nucleus to the outside of the cell carring the amiuno acid code to be transcribes trna translation then you have proteins
the mrna exits the nucleus and links to a ribosome the ribosome attracts amino acids and they match up with their corresponding nucleotides
well  starting with mrna you need to know everything about the dna and the trna then you need to figure out the nuceotides amino acids and what not and also the strands of the dna then finally once you get to the end of the single or double stranded dnas you will have what you need to know
protien synthesis gives messages to the mrna the mrna gives the messages to the trna the trna trnsfers the rna to the rrna the rrna sends the messages to the grna
1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 mrna separtes3 mrna is absorbed by the endoplasmic reticulam4 mrna is now protein
1 the amaino acids have to leave the nucleus to make a copy of their protien2 then the amaino acids break apart to creat a differtnet combination of portiens3 the amaino acids then creats a new strand of codons to make up a protien
first it travels along to the ribosomes next the ribosomes give the mrna its proper trna which has a strand of amino acids then it is sent off finally the proccess is repeated
the mrna goes to the nucleus the mrna is read by the rrnathe trna gets the amino acidsthe amino acids match up with thier partners creating protiens
mrna leaves the nulceus travels to the endoplasmic reticulum then to cell membrane and exits the cell
mrna must leave the system in four ways 1 must be brokendown2 transfered into energy3made into a waste product4moved out of the system
anaphase metaphase interphase and telophase
photosynthesis oxygen diffusion surface area and cellular communication
the mrna leaves the nucleus
after the mrna than the trna comes along to translate what the message says after it does that than the trna takes the infromation to the strand where it will be matched with the corect gene
dnarrnamrnatrna
well when mrna leaves the nucleus the first step is
the mrna leaves the nucleus and gives the information to the rrna who makes the ribonucleic acid and transports it to the trna who helps turn it into codons and translates it into amino acids
first the strand of dna is unzipped then the mrna makes of a copy of rna an anticodon is attached to the other side of the rna then for every codon a protein is formed the protein breaks off and the process is started over again
prophaseinterphasanaphasemetaphase
the mrna goes to the rrna to get the code sequence read and the then decoded  the rrna sends the trna to get its match to the other half at gc
1when a plant is dying2when a plant is being reproduced3when a plant is being born4when a plant is growing
mrna leaves the nucleus then mrna is transferred to trna once data is recieve it transforms the rna in the cell membrane
the mrna leave the nucleus then it go to the cyoplasm next animo acids attached the mrna last mrna is full with animo acids then it break off the mrna
first the mrna gets the message from the nucleus second the mrna transfers the message to the amino acidsthird the amino acids copy the messagefourth the new dna is made
the mrna  takes vacules
in protein synthesis mrna leaves the nucleus then goes to the ribosomes the mrna tells the ribosome how to make the protein then the protein in created
trna translates the strand of dna into a more readalbe formrrna reads the strand and makes more from it
anaphase   interphase metapase prophase
after the mrna got manufactured the dna that is exposed to nucletide bases will pair up with the ribosomes and then it will be the trna and by that they will produced proteins and that happens inside the cytoplasm
in protein synthesis one major step starts when mrna leaves the nucleus through the the nuclear pores carrying the information needed to make the proteins it then enters a ribosome this is because this is where proteins are madethe third thing is that the mrna sequence pairs up into pairs of three making amino acids the last step is that the amino acid codes make the proteins needed
the dna connects to the mrnathe mrna goes throughout the body sending the message to the parts
1 mrna changing into trna2 trna being replicated thus changing into rrna3rrna being it groups of three that are key like structures4 the key like structures turning into proteins
then trna comes to read the mrna then they follow the directions of mrna next they get into there sequence
transltion
rna would leave then it would come dna you would want to know your dna then trna and rrna
1 the mrna is transported to the end of the chain2the mrna is mutated3it is then moved out of the cell4develers the message
1protiens enter the cell2protiens go to the ribosomes3protiens are turned into energy4the energy made is used to perform everyday cell work
the mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acids of a protein  the trna tansfers the steps of the amino acids
when mrna leaves the nucleus it changes to trna  the trna then carries directions to the nucleus aboout how to assemble amino acids  the amino acids are then assmbled  lastly trna is changed into rrna
it will move through the cell collect things from each part of the cell get rid of things it dont need and turn in to rna
mrna leaves the nucleus to deliver the genetic information to the trna the trna then transfers it to the ribosomes it then goes back and gets more the rrna links all of the information together
1  first the mrna is transcribed and then it leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm2  second the mrna attaches to ribosomes  the trna brings the correct codon to match with the mrna3  third the codons attach and start to form a polypeptide chain4  last the trna will bring the last codon of the chain called the stop codon  this signals that the polypeptide chain is done forming and then the chain will be released
1 translation2 matches up with dna sequence3 transcription4 you get amino acid
1 mrna is copied2 one strand is transcripted into trna3 a codon codes for a protien4 the protien is put where the codon was
it leaves the nucles then spindle fibers attach after they attach then nucleotides form and then reproduce
th e four major steps in mrna are the message getting to the messenger rna and the the mrna getting delivered to where it is sussposed to go and the message getting to where it is susposed to go then action being taken
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through transcription where the mrna is recopied into a new stand the mrna has now done its job and the trna takes over the trna carries away the new strand of rna to a new location where it is then used as needed
mrna leaves the nucleusrna leaves intructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein
mrna lives the nucleus then it travels in the cytoplasm looking for a ribossome ones it fiends the ribbossome it goes in and rrna takes controll rrna puts the amino acids in the correct order then trna will bring the anticodons to finish making the protein
the second step is when the rna is brought out to the ribosomes  the third step is when the rna is copied  the rna then is checked for mistakes  then finally the rna gets sent out to delvier the message to the cell
in protein synthesis step one is that mrna uses the star codon to start reading the dna strand second it reads and makes a new strand third it continuosly adds one until it reaches the stop codon which is the fourth step
the four steps in protein synthesis would be     1 mrna leaves the nucleus     2made into proteins     3shipped to rrna     4read and copied
becomes rna and then goes into the ribosomes where it is then changed into protein
the mrna gets converted by the rrna switching the ts out with us when the rrna conversion is done the trna come back through and convert it again also swapping the ts for us
first the mrna leaves the nucleus then it changes its code so it can get through then it is transcribed back to its mrna code so it can become protein
mrna leaves the nucleusthe body trys to find the minerals they needif those cant be found they use  photosynthesis to get the mineralsthe body finally makes the proteins it needs

mrna leaves the nucleus and moves to the lysosome the lysosome turns it into trna and it goes somewhere else
theres mrna trna and other rnas
prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
the mrna has info so it goes to the thing and that thing goes to the ribosome and the ribosome makes proteins then the process begins again
1 transcription starts as soon as the mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna reaches the ribosomes and translation begins3 the trna goes and gets the necessary enzymes for making the proteins4 the trna returns and the proteins are made
1mrna leaves the nucleus2mrna transfers message to trna3trna gives off message to rrna4rrna gives message to body
the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome their nulceotides are added to the seqence next the sequence is sent to the golgi apparatus where the protein is packaged for sending the packaged protein is then sent to the mitochondria for use
mrna sends a message then rrna goes through a process with amino acids attached at the bottom once they go through this process trna occurs to make proiens for protien synthesis
transcription  the rnas make a double copytranslation  the trnas copy overcarries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
anaphase metaphase telophase
the mrna goes to a ribosome where it attaches to the psitetrna match their anticodons to the respective codons of the portion of the mrna strand in the psiteafter matching the mrna moves so that a new segment is in the psite and the old segment is in the asitethe amino acids connected to the trna that match up with the mrna codons create peptide bonds and create a protein
as the mrna leaves the nucleus it iks decoded into an amino acid after that the peptide bond between the stand of dna starts to unravel from there a new strand is subtituted in the last step is when a peptide bond binds the strand back together and it is ready to be used
the mrna travels to a ribosome translation occurs and trna attraches the anticodons to the mrna that correspond with it on the other end of the trna is the amino acid the amino acids join together and detach from the trna and become a protein
1it leaves and finds a host 2then it injects a die into it 3and it dies 4then the host produces more mrna 5and then it leaves the nucleus again
trans something
1transcription that caopies a complementary side of dna2translation which takes the copies and tells the necleotide where to go3trna that transfers the material that has already been translated4the stop codon that tells the protein when to stop so that it could be a protein
the mrna carries all of the needed things to the rrna which will help synthesize protiens then the mrna carries the coded information to the trna which proccesses it and decodes it
photosynthesis
first the mrna splits in two then the the mrnas purines pair up with their opposing purimidines after a two new rna strands are formed it goes to the ribosomes
the mrna replicates it starts to increase the amount of proteins to cause protein synthesis
mrna leaves the nucleus and is taken to the ribosomes there it is translated into various amino acids these amino acids are then make up proteins
mrna will leave the nucleus carrying the coding for the protein from the dna it will place itself in the cytoplasm waiting for the matching amino acids to connect the trna will bring the attacted amino acids to the mrna and place them in the correct spot on the sequence then the enzyme will come and create the protein using the code that the amino acids made from mrna
after leaving the cell mrna then goes and copies itself  then the mrna goes and finds another stand of rnathe original mrna goes back into the cell and hooks up with a new stand of rna
sugar
first it stores the protein second it moves the protein third it uses the protein to increase muscle finally it dissolves the remaining protein
1 the mrna transfers information to the amino acids2 makes a copy of one strand of the dna3 tells the trna what to do4 builds more nitrogen bases
the mrna is matched with other nucleotides once it is out of the nucleas then three nucleotides form a codon which then creates an anticodon and then the codon codes for an aminno acid and then the amino acids then make the protein by the amino acids ajoining together
first mrna receives a copy of the amino acid codon then the mrna transfers that copy and reads the copy it is then starting the process of making the protein when the copy has been transfered and read and made then the protein is made when the stop codon is passed and the process just keeps repeating after that
mrna will exit through the nucleus and travel to possible ribosomes that are nearby trna will come with codons that will now attach themselves to the mrna in a certain way it first must seek the aug which is the start codon the rrna will attach to the mrna and create an area to where the codons can attach to the mrna and create their own proteins as proteins are formes they are linked to form a polypeptide chain this breaks down loose when reaching of a stop codon occurs
the messenger rna mrna leaves the nucleus with the code for the proteins needed the trna transcribes this code then the trna brings this code to ribosomes the ribosomes create the needed proteins
mrnatrna
the first step is finding the nucleus the second step isemerging with a cell the third step is combined with the cell the fourth step add to the protien
1 the mrna moves out of the nucleus2 next the mrna then goes to its autosome
mrna divides mrna  becomes two new ones
mrna leaves the nucleus it is copied in a lysosome then a protien chain is created that matches the sequence
proteins have sequences that have a g c and t these codons have counterpartners for example a goes to t and c goes to g
the mrna goes and gets coded to join the dna strand
process the cell
interphase metaphaseanaphasepropahse
the mrna leaves the nucleas and tracks down the ribosomes and then attachs to it then goes and copies the dna
the four major parts involved with protein synthesis are the mitochondria the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes  these are all involved with protein synthesis
mrna takes protien to the dna which turns it into trna which takes it along the dna to make amino acids once the rna has combined with the dna it makes a codon or an amino acid
mrna which is initially dna from the nucleus travels to  the endoplasmic recticulum where it is used to make protein
then it attaches on to the trna then goes through the codons

mitochondriaproteins tanslaiontanseion
the mrna tells what the codons arethe trna changes the dna form of codons in to rna form of codonsthe rrna creates the new strand of rna to create new proteins
there begins a process whe nparts of a cell being coping a dna strand like you would for an old movie themlir
mrna leaves the nucleus mrna sends protein information to new rna the new rna takes the code and synthesizes to the new protein
the mrna gets transcribed it leaves the nucleus by the ribosomes  then it travels on the endocplasmic reticulum and goes to the lysomes and gets translated to  proteins
after mrna leaves the nucleus four major stps take place in order to complete protein synthesis    1 the mrna contains the codes for creating the proteins and thus goes to the ribosomes which make proteins     2 the ribosomes receive this information from the mrna and translate the code into the type of protein that must be made     3 this translated code provides the instructions for making the protein and the ribosomes begin creating the protein     4 several proteins are made with specialized functions depending on their code
mrna leaves the nucleus trna transfers it over to mrna which gives the message of genes to the rrna which carries out the job
1trna attaches to the mrna2ribosomes come in and attach3codons and anticodons attach4 polypeptide chain is formed
after mrna leaves the nucleus it translates the dna into rna the trna goes and retrieves the right amino acid to be coded in then the rrna check the chain for any mistakes at last the protien is sent out towherever it is needed
sugars
mrna leaves the nucleus through osmosis it goes to the electron transport chain then is transported to the calvin cycle no oxygen means the system gets backed up
metaphase prophase anaphase and interphase
it leaves the nucleusthen exits the cellgrabs information from a strand in the body somewherethen returns to the cells nucleus
mrna leaves the nucleus gets the protein breaks it down sends it off to the rest of the body
the mrna leaves the nucleus and then tell the rest of the cell what to do it then makes all of the proteins line up in the irght order so that dna can be made it must make sure that all the proteins are in the right sequence because a defect in the seguence can cause a mutation causeing problems for everything else in the body once everything is lined up and checked it is then dna
the mrna conecting to make the dna the dna reproduceing and speading throughout the cell the trna takeing the carbon dioxide to the chlorophyl to be converted into oxygen the oxygen leaveing the cell as waste
1ribosomes have to make protein2protein goes to the mitchondria3the golgi body then takes it4 mrna takes over and releases the proteins
after mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosomes then starts making protein
after it leaves it goes to the cell that has been copied then after that it makes another copy then it starts the cycle of meiosis and then that becomes rna and that would match the exact sequnce as the dna
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes towards the ribosome 2 trna comes to the ribosome carrying an amino acid 3 the trna reads the codons on the mrna which code for each amino acid 4 the amino acids form a polypeptide chain which becomes a protein
the rna sends a message sequence to the new sell with the cells information
when mrna leaves the necleus the strand of dna goes through transcription where codons fix mistakesthen the mrna becomes trna then it maches up with different types of amino acids
the four major steps are mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through the mitochondria and out
protiens are lipids that creat building blocks to help the body the blocks then go the where the body mostly needs it mrnd is the diliverer from the dna the mrna then sends whatever needs to be send to wichever part of the body
a or c or u latch together g and d latch together they form a strand
new mrna is madethe prtoein goes through a series of changesit passes on data or mrnait gets data from other protiens
the mrna leaves the nucleus and then attaches to rrna ribosomal rna once firmly attached to this ribosomal rna the mrna forms codons which are a set of three neuclotides these codons then match with anticodons on trna which also hold amino acids the amio acids on the trna form peptide bonds with the other amino acids to form a chain once the bond between two proteins has been formed the trna floats away to find another amino acid to carry this process continues until there is a full chain of amino acids which then creates a protein
proteins move into the cells
first mrna leaves the nucleus second trna carries the instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protien then comes r rna
mrna leaves the nucleus then the mrna goes and gets a ribosome from smooth endoplasmic reticulm it then takes the ribosome to the mitochandria and uses sugar nitrogen and carbon dioxide to produce a protein consisting of animo acids
after mrna leaves the nucleus it is sent to the ribosome in the ribosome the mrna is read by the trna in a process called transcription for every three base pairs an amino acid is made the trna continues to read the mrna until a stop codon tells it to stop all the amino acids are held together by peptide bonds the finished product of amino acids is a protein
after the mrna leaves it must brake down then after it breakes in halk those to halves have to make a new half then makeing those new halves you have two new protein strands
1 the dna splits at the dna helicase2 the rna attatches to the dna3 the mrna implants its chromesomes 4 the mrna extracts
protein maintains and repairs muscles protein is in ribosomes the ir in cells and they also have 4 nuclitides
mrna takes over
four steps of protien synthesis are the rna leaving the nucleus rna splits mrna merges trna comes and merges with the mrna
after leaving the nucleus mrna begins to go through out the body and cause infections then the b bodies go into the body looking for the infection and then they trake down the z  bodies once the z bodies are called down they travel throughout the body and once they find the infection the track it down and fight it off
protein synthesis is the evolution and mutation of proteins in the body the first major step of this process is when mrna leaves the nucleus the second step would be when the mitochondria begins to send out messages to begin the process the dna then sends out coding for the process as well the final step is the completed product
vaportionrain
trna carries instuctions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence
there is a start codon and trna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequences they are attached and translated
it leaves the nucleus and then goes to the golgi apparatus and then goes through a turbine like thing that turnes it into protein
the four major steps are after the mrna leaves it goes into the cytoplasm once its in the cytoplasm it finds a trna strand and they combine together
1 it replicates istelf2 it starts to synthesize3 then it starts to change into protein4 the final product you get is protein
transcription replication decryption encryption
mrna goes to different places it gets different proteins it acts as a messenger to different parts of the cell then it leaves
transfer rna it sends the mrna to different parts of the bod y mrna it sends messages to the cell floor also knownw as the cytoplasm
the mrna leaves the nucleus and takes the information it has to the trna which then translates the information to tell the cell what codon it needs to bring to complete the chain once that is done the trna sends the chain to be assembled once it is assembled the left over material is sent out of the cell to be desposed of
protien synthesis can provide energy it can help you gain weight and muscles finally it can help you when your older
first the dna replicatsthen the dna transcribes into rnanext the rna replicats
mrna trna rrna rna
after mrna leaves the nucleus it          1 gets split and goes through trna          2 gets copied and attached again
the cells are createdthen the cells devide     then they make more cells
four steps involved in protein synthesis is reproduction mutation
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus2 the mrna turns to dna so it is a stable chemical now3 then the dna is stored for a long period of time4 over time it is turned into protein and that helps the cell
trna transfers dna
metaphase anaphase telophase and prophase
mrna is copied into trna
the mrna leaves the the nucleus then goes to th cytoplasm where it gives its intructions to the rrna the rrna reads those instructions and uses protein brought in by thr trna and assemble amino acids in the correct order
anaphasecombineinterphasemove apartmetaphasemeet in the middle prophasedivide into 2
mrna leaves the nucleus and attaches to the ribosome it then tells the ribosomes to make a sequence of nucleotides
first the proteins are gathered next the proteins separate then start to synthesize if proteins dont move during process then they will be reproduced
1 the mrna leaves the nucleus leaves the cell and goes to the ribosomes  2 the mrna is transcribed3 trna collects the amino acids and brings them bact to the ribosones 4 the ribosomes place together the amino acids into a single strand of protein
m rna leaves the nucleus
the messenger rna leaves the nucleus and brings the dna to the cytoplasm the dna ladder unzips and the nucleotides are trying to find their matches this is called transcription rna processing then occurs and the genetic code is given to the nucleus translation happenes after the genetic code reaches the nucleus during translation the codons find their anticodons in pairs of 3 to start making amino acids after 20 amino acids there will be a stop codon indicating the process to stop
the mrna leaves the nucleus then with the coiled dna sequence it matches up the corresponding amino acids then it goes to the ribosome and drops off the amino acids that match i they dont match then they go back and try to do it again when they do match it forms an amino acid and then it forms a protein
in protein synthesis after the mrna leaves the nucleus the cell will need to make a copy of the mrna after copying it it will be synthized then the copied version and the original version will be crossed over to cause genetic variation for the organism last the cell will be sent out to the body to replace the ones that can no longer do thier job efficiently
four major steps would be prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
the nucleus leaves the body
when mrna leaves the nucleus the ribosomes take it to the golgi apparatusthen from there it goes to the mitochondria and then the nucleus
annaphase prophase metaphase telephase
the first step is the mrna is unzipped by a rna polymerase then it is made into trna after that it enters our dna and lastly it is made into protein
htey are manufacture and produced and used trhen excreated from the nucleus
well after the rna leaves the nucleus it makes a sectiond strand that maches form the strand that it made to go with the dna it then turns in to trna witch turn the t bace in to a u bace and the u bace pears up with the a bace then they canect with the rran to make the ameno acideds
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
mrna leaves the nucleus
mrna leaves the nucleus first second they get the atp and they take it to the mitochondria and they let them know what they have to fix fourth they go to the place where the cell needs fixed and fifth they end up with protein synthesis
the mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna takes a code to a ribosome the amino acids in the ribosome translates the code and attaches a responds to the trna the trna goes back to the nucleus with with its coded segments
mrna enters the cytoplasm it then carries instructions to the ammino acid sequence then it turns into trna and carries the complete sequence off from there it creates a protien
proteins gather togetherproteins attach to each otherin order to attempt to repair the nucleusproteins go to the nucleus
name
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are when the dna is being replicated when rrna is being produced when trna is being produced and when mrna is being changed
first you go to prophase then from prophase you go to metaphase from metaphase you go to anaphase from anaphase you go to telephase during all these steps you start offf with two cell then you have the cells seprating into two seprate one then they just end as being one cell
